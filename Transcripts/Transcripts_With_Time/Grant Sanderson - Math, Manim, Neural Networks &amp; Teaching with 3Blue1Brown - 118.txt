Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 grant sanderson his second time on the podcast he'sknown to millions of people
 as the mind behind three blue one brown a youtube channelwhere he educates and inspires the world
 with the beauty and power of mathematics quick summary of thesponsors

 and to support this podcast especially for the two new sponsorsdollar shave club and doordash let me
 say as a side note i think that this pandemic challengedmillions of educators to rethink how
 they teach to rethink the nature of education aspeople know
 grant is a master elucidator of mathematical conceptsthat may otherwise seem difficult or out
 of reach for students and curious minds but he's also an inspiration to teachersresearchers
 and people who just enjoy sharing knowledge like mefor what it's worth it's one thing to
 give a semester's worth of multi-hour lecturesit's another to extract from those
 lectures the most important interesting beautiful and difficultconcepts
 and present them in a way that makes everything fall into placethat is the challenge that is worth
 taking on my dream is to see more and more of my colleagues at mitand world experts across the world
 summon their inner three blue one brown and create thecanonical explainer videos on a topic
 that they know more than almost anyone else in the worldamidst the political division the
 economic pain the psychological medical toll of thevirus masterfully crafted educational
 content feels like one of the beacons of hopethat we can hold on to

 grant sanderson you've spoken about richardfeynman as someone
 you admire i think last time we spoke we ran out of timeso i wanted to talk to you about him um
 who is uh richard feynman to you in your eyes what impact did he have on you

0:05:28
Speaker 0 :i mean i think a ton of people like
 feynman he's probably it's a little bit cliche to say that you like finemanright that's
 um almost like when you don't know what to say about sports and you just pointto
 the super bowl or something it's something you enjoy watching but i doactually think there's a layer to
 feynman that like sits behind the iconography onething that just really struck me
 was this letter that he wrote to his wife two years after she diedso during the manhattan project she had
 polio tragically she died they were just young madly in love andyou know the the icon of feynman is this
 almost this like mildly sexist womanizing philanderer atleast on the personal side
 but you read this letter and i can try to pull it up for you if i want and it'sjust this
 absolutely heartfelt letter to his wife saying how much he loves hereven though she's dead and kind of what
 she means to him how no woman can ever measure up to her and it shows you thatthe fineman that we've all seen in like
 surely you're joking is different from the feynman in realityand i think the same kind of goes in his
 science where you know he kind of sometimes has thisoutput of being this ah shucks character
 like everyone else is coming in this with thesefancy flute and formulas but i'm just
 gonna try to whittle it down to its essentialswhich is so appealing because we love to
 see that kind of thing but when you get into itlike what he was doing was actually
 quite deep very much mathematical um that should gowithout saying but i remember reading a
 book about feynman in a cafe once and this woman looked at me andwas like uh saw that it was about
 findman she was like oh i love him i read shirley you're jokingand she started explaining to me how he
 was never really a math person and uh i don't understand how that couldpossibly be a public perception about
 any physicist but for whatever reason that like worked into his or thathe sort of shoot off math in place of
 true science the reality of it is he was deeply in love with math and was muchmore going in that direction and had a
 clicking point into seeing that physics was a way torealize that and all the creativity that
 he could output in that direction um was insteadpoured towards things like fundamental
 not even fundamental theories just emergent phenomena and everything likethat
 so to answer your actual question like what what i like about uhhis way of going at things is this
 constant desire to reinvent it for himself like when hewould consume papers the way he
 described it he would start to see what problem he was trying to solve and thenjust try to solve it himself to get a
 sense of personal ownership and then from there see what others had

0:07:51
Speaker 1 :done is that how you see problems
 yourself like that's actually an interesting pointwhen you first
 are inspired by a certain idea that you maybe want to teach orvisualize or just explore on your own
 i'm sure you're captured by some possibility and magic of itdo you read the work of others like do
 you go through the proof see do you try to rediscover

0:08:14
Speaker 0 :everything yourself so um i think the
 things that i've like learned best and have the deepestownership of are the ones that have some
 element of rediscovery the problem is that really slows youdown and this is for my for my part it's
 actually a big fault like this is part of why i'mi'm not an active researcher i'm not
 like at the depth of the field a lot of other people arethe stuff that i do learn i try to learn
 it really well um but other times you do need to getthrough it at a certain pace you do need
 to get to a point of a problem you're trying to solve so obviously you need tobe well equipped to read things
 uh without that reinvention component and see how others have done itbut i think if you choose a few core
 building blocks along the way and you say i'm really going to try toapproach this before i see how this
 person went at it i'm really going to try to approach it for myselfno matter what you gain all sorts of
 inarticulatable intuitions about that topicwhich aren't going to be there if you
 simply go through the proof for example you're going to be trying tocome up with counter examples
 you're going to try to come up with um intuitive examplesall sorts of things where you're
 populating your brain with data and the ones that you come up with are likely tobe different than the one that the text
 comes up with and that like lends it a different angleso that
 aspect also slowed feynman down in a lot of respects i think there was a periodwhen
 like the rest of physics was running away from him um but in so far he's gotit got him to where he was uh i i i kind
 of resonate with that i just i would i would be nowhere nearit because i
 not like him at all but it's like a

0:09:40
Speaker 1 :state to aspire to you know just
 to look at a small point you made that you're not a quote-unquote activeresearcher
 do you you're swimming often in reasonably good depth about a lot oftopics
 do you sometimes want to like dive deep ata certain moment and say like because
 you probably built up a hell of an amazing intuition about what is andisn't true
 within these worlds do you ever want to just dive in and see if you can discover

0:10:13
Speaker 0 :something new yeah
 i think one of my biggest regrets from undergrad is not havingbuilt better relationships with the
 professors i had there and i think a big part of success in researchis that element of like mentorship and
 like people giving you the kind of scaffolded problems to carry alongfor my own like goals right now i feel
 like um i'm pretty good at exposing math toothers and
 like want to continue doing that for my personal learningi are you familiar with like the
 hedgehog fox dynamic i think this was um either theancient greeks came up with it or
 it was pretended to be something drawn from the ancient creek said i don't knowwho to
 point it to but they had probably mocked twain it is that you've got twotypes of people or especially two types
 of researchers there's the fox that knows many different thingsand then the hedgehog that knows one
 thing very deeply so like von neumann would have been afox he's someone who knows many
 different things just very foundational a lot of differentfields einstein would have been more of
 a hedgehog thinking really deeply about one particular thingand both are very necessary for making
 progress um so between those two i would definitelysee myself as like the fox
 where uh i'll try to get my paws in like a whole bunch of different thingsand at the moment i just think i don't
 know enough of anything to make like a significant contribution to any of thembut i do see value in um like having a
 decently deep understanding of a wide variety ofthings like
 most people who uh know computer science really deeplydon't necessarily know physics very
 deeply or many of the aspects like differentfields in math even let's say you have
 like an analytic number theory versus an algebraic number theory like these twothings end up being
 related to very different fields like some of them more complex analysis someof them more like algebraic geometry
 and then when you just go out so far as to take those adjacent fields place oneyou know phd student into a seminar of
 another one they don't understand what the other one's saying at alllike you take the complex analysis
 specialist inside the algebraic geometry seminarthey're as lost as you or i would be but
 i think uh going around and like trying to have some sense ofwhat this big picture is certainly has
 personal value for me i don't know if i would ever make likenew contributions in those fields but i
 do think i could make new like expositional contributions where there'skind of a notion of
 uh things that are known but like haven't been explained very well

0:12:29
Speaker 1 :well first of all i think most people
 would agree your videos your teaching the way you see the worldis fundamentally often new
 like you're creating something new and it almost feels like research even justlike the visualizations
 uh the multi-dimensional visualization we'll talk about i mean you're revealingsomething very interesting
 that uh yeah just feels like research feels like sciencefeels like the cutting edge of the very
 thing of which like new ideas and newdiscoveries are made of


0:13:02
Speaker 0 :i do think you're being a little bit
 more generous than is necessarily and i promise that's not even falsehumility because i sometimes think when
 i research a video i'll learn like 10 times as much as i need for the videoitself and it ends up feeling
 kind of elementary um so i have a sense of just how far awaylike the stuff that i cover is from the


0:13:20
Speaker 1 :actual depth
 i think that's natural but i think that could also be a mathematics thingi feel like in the machine learning
 world you like two weeks in you feel like you'vebasically mastered in mathematics it's


0:13:34
Speaker 0 :like
 well everything is either trivial or impossible and it's like a shockinglythin line between the two
 where you can find something that's totally impenetrable and then after youget a feel for it's like oh yeah that
 whole that whole subject is actually trivialin some way
 so maybe that's what goes on every researcher is just on the other end ofthat hump and it feels like it's so far
 away but one step actually gets them there what do you

0:13:55
Speaker 1 :think about
 sort of feynman's teaching style or another perspective isof use of uh visualization


0:14:05
Speaker 0 :well his teaching style is interesting
 because people have described like the feynman effect where while you'rewatching
 his lectures or while he's reading his lectures everything makes such perfectsense
 so as an entertainment session it's wonderfulbecause it gives you this this
 intellectual satisfaction that you don't get from anywhere elsethat you like finally understand it
 but the feynman effect is that you can't really recall what it is that gave youthat insight
 you know even a week later and this is um this is true of a lot of books in alot of lectures where
 the retention is never quite what we hope it is umso there is a risk
 that uh the stuff that i do also fits that same billwhere at best it's giving this kind of
 intellectual candy on giving a glimpse of feeling like you understand somethingbut unless you do something active like
 reinventing it yourself like doing problemsum to solidify it um even things like
 space repetition memory to just make sure that you havelike the building blocks of what do all
 the terms mean unless you're doing something like that it's not actuallygonna stick
 so the very same thing that's so admirable about findman's lectures whichis
 how damn satisfying they are to consume might actually also reveal a little bitof the flaw that we should
 as educators all look out for which is that that does not correlate withlong-term learning


0:15:24
Speaker 1 :we'll talk about it a little bit i think
 well you've done some interactive stuff i mean even in yourvideos
 the awesome thing that feynman couldn't do at the time isyou could since it's programmed you can
 like tinker like play with stuff you couldtake this value and change it
 you can like here let's take the value of this variable and change itto build up an intuition to move along a
 surface or to to change the shape of something i thinkthat's almost
 an equivalent of you doing it yourself it's not quite there butyou as a viewer um yeah do you think
 there's some value in that interactive element yeah well so what's

0:16:04
Speaker 0 :interesting is
 you're saying that and the videos are non-interactive in the sense thatthere's a play button and a pause button
 um and you could ask like hey while you're programming these things whydon't you program it into an
 interactable version that you know make it a jupyter notebook that peoplecan play with which i should do and that
 like would be better i think the thing about interactivesthough is most people consuming them
 just sort of consume what the author had in mind uhand that's kind of what they want like i
 have a ton of friends who make interactive explanationsand when you look into the analytics of
 how people use them there's a small sliver thatgenuinely use it as a playground to have
 experiments and maybe that small sliver is actuallywho you're targeting and the rest don't
 matter but most people consume it just as apiece of um like well-constructed
 literature that maybe you tweak with the example alittle bit to see what it's getting at
 but in that way i do think like a video can get most of the benefits of theinteractive
 like the interactive um app as long as you make the interactive for yourselfand you decide what the best narrative
 to spin is as a more concrete example like myprocess with
 i made this video about um sir models for epidemicsand it's like this agent-based bottling
 thing where you tweak some things about how the epidemicspreads and you want to see how that
 affects its evolution um my my uh format formaking that was very different than
 others where rather than scripting it ahead of timei just made the playground and then i
 played a bunch uh and then i saw what stories therewere to tell within that


0:17:30
Speaker 1 :um yeah that's cool so your video had
 that kind of structure it had uh like five or six stories or whatever itwas
 and like it was basically okay here's a simulation here's a modelwhat can we discover with this model and


0:17:45
Speaker 0 :here's five things i found after
 playing with it well because here the thing isa way that you could do that project is
 you make the model and then you put it out and you say here's a thing for theworld to play with like come to my
 website where you interact with this thingum and and people did like sort of
 remake it in a javascript way so that you can go to that website and you cantest your own hypotheses
 but i think a meaningful part of the value to add is not just the technologybut to give the story around it as well
 and like that's kind of my job it's not just to like makethe uh the visuals that someone will
 look at it's to be the one to decide what's theinteresting thing to walk through here
 um and even though there's lots of otherinteresting paths that one could take
 that can be kind of daunting when you're just sitting there in a sandbox andyou're given this tool with like five
 different sliders and you're told to like play anddiscover things it's like
 where do you do what do you start what are my hypotheses what should i beasking
 like a little bit of guidance in that direction can be what actually sparkscuriosity to make someone want to
 imagine more about it a few videos i've

0:18:42
Speaker 1 :seen you do
 i don't know how often you do it but there's almost a tangential like pausewhere you here's a cool thing you say
 like here's a cool thing but it's outside the scope of this videoessentially but i'll leave it to you as
 homework essentially to like figure out it's acool thing to explore


0:19:02
Speaker 0 :i wish i could say that wasn't a
 function of laziness right and that's like you've worked sohard on uh making the 20 minutes already
 that to extend it out even further it would take more time

0:19:12
Speaker 1 :and one of your cooler videos the
 homomorphic like from the mobius strip to thedescribed rectangle yeah
 that's the super and you're like yeah you can't uh you can't transform themobius strip into uh
 into a surface without it intersecting itselfbut i'll leave it to you to to see why
 that is

0:19:36
Speaker 0 :i hope that's not exactly how i phrase
 it because i think what my hope would be is thati leave it to you to think about why you
 would expect that to be true and then to want to know what aspects ofa mobius strip do you want to formalize
 such that you can prove that intuition that you havebecause at some point now you're
 starting to invent algebraic topology if uh you have thesevague instincts like
 i want to get this mobius strip i want to fit itsuch that it's all above the plane but
 its boundary sits exactly on the plane i don't thinki can do that without crossing itself
 but that feels really vague how do i formalize it and as you're starting toformalize that
 that's what's going to get you to try to come up with a definition for what itmeans to be orientable or not orientable
 and like once you have that motivation a lot of the otherwise arbitrary thingsthat are sitting at the very beginning
 of a topology textbook start to make a little more

0:20:27
Speaker 1 :sense yeah and i mean that that whole
 video beautifully was a motivation fortopology is cool


0:20:32
Speaker 0 :that was my well my hope with that is i
 feel like topology is um i don't want to say it's taught wrong but i do thinksometimes it's popularized in the wrong
 way where uh you know you'll hear thesethings of people saying oh topologists
 they're very interested in surfaces that you can bend and stretch but you can'tcut
 or glue are they why yeah there's all sorts of things you canbe interested in with random like
 imaginative manipulations of things is that reallywhat like mathematicians are into
 and the short answer is not not really that'suh it's not as if someone was sitting
 there thinking like i wonder what the properties of clay areif i had some arbitrary rules about what
 when i can't cut it and when i can't glue it instead it'sthere's a ton of pieces of math that
 can actually be equivalent to like these very general structuresthat's like geometry except you don't
 have exact distances you just want to maintain a notion of closenessand once you get it to those general
 structures constructing mappings between themtranslate into non-trivial facts about
 other parts of math and that i just i don't think that'sactually pub like popularized um
 i don't even think it's emphasized well enough when you're starting to take atopology class
 because you kind of have these two problems it's like either it's toosquishy you're just talking about coffee
 mugs and donuts or it's a little bit too rigor first andyou're talking about
 um the axiom systems with open sets and an open set is not the opposite ofclosed set so sorry about that everyone
 we have a notion of clopin sets for ones that are both at the same timeyeah um and
 just it's not it's not an intuitive axiom system in comparison to otherfields of math
 so you as the student like really have to walk through mud to get thereand you're constantly confused about how
 this relates to the beautiful things about coffee mugs andmobius strips and such and it takes a
 really long time to actually see that like c topology in the way thatmathematicians see topology
 but i don't think it needs to take that time i think there's umthis is making me feel like i need to
 make more videos on the topic because i think

0:22:29
Speaker 1 :you do but you know i've also seen it in
 my narrow view of uh like i'm i find game theory verybeautiful
 and i know topology has been used uh elegantlyto prove things in game theory yeah you


0:22:41
Speaker 0 :have like facts that seem very strange
 like i could tell you you stir your coffee and um after you stirit and like let's say all the molecules
 settle to like not moving again one of the molecules will be basicallyin the same position it was before um
 you have all sorts of fixed point theorems like this rightthat kind of fixed point theorem
 directly relevant to nash equilibriums right umso you can imagine popularizing it by
 describing the coffee fact but then you're left to wonder like who caresabout if a molecule of coffee like stays
 in the same spot is this what we're paying our mathematicians forum you have this very elegant mapping
 onto economics in a way that's very concreteor very i shouldn't say concrete very uh
 tangible like actually adds value to people's lives through the predictionsthat it makes
 but that line isn't always drawn because like you have to get a little bittechnical in order to
 properly draw that line out and often i think popularizedforms of media just shy away from being
 a little too technical

0:23:37
Speaker 1 :for sure oh by the way for people who
 are watching the video i do not condone the message and this mugit's the only one i have which is this
 the snuggle is real

0:23:46
Speaker 0 :by the way for anyone watching i do
 condone the message of that mug the struggle

0:23:51
Speaker 1 :the snuggle is real okay so you
 mentioned the sir model i thinkthere are certain ideas there of growth
 of exponential growth what maybehave you learned about um
 pandemics from from making that video because it was kind of exploratory youwere kind of building up an intuition
 and it's again people should watch the video it's kind of an abstract view it'snot
 really modeling in detail the whole field of epidemiologythose those people they go
 really far in terms of modeling like how peoplemove about i don't know if you've seen
 it but like they're it's really their mobility patterns likehow like they try like how many people
 you encounter in certain situations when you go to aschool when you go to a mall
 they like model every aspect of that for a particular city like they have mapsof actual city streets they model it
 really well and natural patterns of the people haveit's crazy so you don't do any of that
 you're just doing an abstract model to explore different ideas

0:24:58
Speaker 0 :of simple
 i'm an epidemiologist like we have a ton of armchair epidemiologistsand the spirit of that was more like uh
 can we through a little bit of play uh draw like reasonable-ish conclusionsum and also just like uh get ourselves
 in a position where we can judge the validity of a model like ithink people should look at that and
 they should criticize it they should point to all the ways that it's wrongbecause it's definitely naive
 right in the way that it's set up um but to say like whatwhat lessons from that hold like
 thinking about the are not value and what that represents andwhat it can imply or not so are not is
 if you are infectious and you're in a population which isum completely susceptible what's the
 average number of people that you're going to infectduring your infectiousness so certainly
 during the beginning of an epidemic this basically gives youkind of the
 exponential growth rate like if every person infects two others you've gotthat one two four eight
 exponential growth pattern um as it goes on andlet's say it's something um uh endemic
 where you've got like a ton of people who have had itand are recovered then uh you would the
 r naught value doesn't tell you that as directlybecause a lot of the people you interact
 with aren't susceptible but in the early phases it does um andthis is like the fundamental constant
 that it seems like epidemiologists look at andyou know the whole goal is to get that
 down if you can get it below one then it's no longer epidemicif it's equal to one then it's endemic
 and it's above one then you're epidemic so uh like just teaching what that valueis and giving some intuitions on
 how do certain changes in behavior change that value and then what doesthat imply for exponential growth
 i think those are um general enough lessons and they'relike resilient to all of the chaoses of
 the world um that it's still like valid to takefrom the video i mean one of the


0:26:52
Speaker 1 :interesting
 aspects of that is just exponential growth and we think aboutgrowth is that one of the first times
 you've done a video on on uh no of course not the whole uh

0:27:08
Speaker 0 :oilers identity okay so sure i've done a
 lot of videos about exponential growth in the circular directionuh only minimal in the normal direction
 i mean

0:27:15
Speaker 1 :another way to ask like do you think
 we're able to reason intuitively about

0:27:22
Speaker 0 :exponential growth
 it's it's funny i think it's um i think it's extremely intuitive to humansand then we train it out of ourselves
 such that it's then really not intuitive and then i think it can become intuitiveagain when you study a technical field
 uh so what i mean by that is um have you ever heard of these studieswhere in a uh like anthropological
 setting where you're studying a group that has been disassociated from alot of like modern society and you ask
 what number is between one and nine and maybe you would askyou you've got like one rock and you've
 got nine rocks you're like what pile is halfway in between theseand our instinct is usually to say five
 that's the number that sits right between one and ninebut sometimes when uh numeracy and uh
 the kind of just basic arithmetic that we have isn't in a societythe natural instinct is three because
 it's uh in between in an exponential senseand a geometric sense that
 one is three times bigger and then the next one is three times bigger than thatso it's like what's you know if you have
 one friend versus a hundred friends what's in between that yeah ten friendsseems like the
 social status in between those two states so that's like deeply intuitiveto us to think logarithmically like that
 um and for some reason we kind of train it out of ourselves to start thinkinglinearly


0:28:35
Speaker 1 :about things so in the sense yeah the
 early early basic math is uh yeah it forces us to take a stepback
 it's it's the same criticism if there's any of scienceis the lessons of science
 make us like see the world in a slightly narrow senseto where we we have an over-exaggerated
 confidence that we understand everything as opposed to just understanding a smallslice of it


0:29:02
Speaker 0 :but i think that probably only really
 goes for small numbers because the real counterintuitive thing about exponentialgrowth is like as the numbers start to
 get big so i bet if you took that same setup andyou asked them oh if i keep tripling
 the size of this rock pile you know um seven times how big will it bei bet it would be surprisingly big even
 to like an a society without numeracy and that'sthe side of it that
 um i think is pretty counter-intuitive to us uhbut that you can basically train into
 people like i think computer scientists and physicistswhen they're looking at the early
 numbers of um like kovid were they were the ones thinkinglike oh god this is following an exact
 exponential curve yeah um and i heard that from a numberof people
 uh so it's and almost all of them are like techies in some capacityprobably just because i like live in the
 bay area but but for sure

0:29:51
Speaker 1 :they're cognizant of this kind of this
 kind of growth is present in a lot of natural systems and a lot ofin a lot of in a lot of systems uh i
 don't know if you've seen like i mean there's a lot of ways to visualize thisobviously but
 ray kurzweil i think was the one that had this like chess boardwhere um every every square in the
 chessboard you double the number of stones or something in that chessboard

0:30:16
Speaker 0 :i've heard this is like an old proverb
 where you know someone the king offered him a gift and he said uh the only gifti would like very modest give me a
 single grain of rice right so the first chessboard and thentwo grains of rice for the next square
 then twice that for the next square and justcontinue on that's my only modest ask
 you're sire yeah and like then it's all you know more grains ofrice than there are
 uh anything in the world um by the time

0:30:41
Speaker 1 :you get to the end and i
 i my intuition falls apart there like i would have never predicted thatlike for some reason that's a really
 compelling uh illustration how poorly breaks downjust like you said maybe we're okay for
 the first few piles but of rocks but after a while it's

0:30:59
Speaker 0 :game over you know the other classic
 example for um gauging someone's intuitive understanding of exponentialgrowth
 is uh i've got like a lily pad on a on lake really big lakeokay um like lake michigan and that lily
 pad replicates it doubles um one day and then it doubles the nextday and it doubles the next day
 and after 50 days it actually is going to cover the entire lakeokay so after how many days does it
 cover half the lake

0:31:26
Speaker 1 :

0:31:27
Speaker 0 :49. so you you have a good instinct for
 exponential growth right so i think a lot of uh like theknee-jerk reaction is sometimes to think
 that it's like half the amount of time or to at leastbe like surprised
 that like after 49 days you've only covered half of it

0:31:43
Speaker 1 :um yeah i mean that's the reason you
 heard a pause from me i literally thought that can't be right

0:31:48
Speaker 0 :right yeah exactly exactly
 so even when you know the fact and you do the division it's likewow so you've gone like that whole time
 and then day 49 it's only covering half and then after that it gets the wholething
 but i think you can make that even more visceral if rather than going one daybefore you say how long until
 um it's covered one percent of the lake right and it'suh so what would that be um how many
 times you have to double to get over a hundred like seven six and a halftimes something like that
 right so at that point you're looking at 4344 days into it you're not even at one
 percent of the lake so you've you've experienced you know 44out of 50 days and you're like ah that
 lilly bad it's just one percent of the lakebut then next thing you know it's the


0:32:27
Speaker 1 :entire lake
 are you wearing a spacex sure so let me ask you surelet me ask you one one person uh who
 talks about exponential you know justthe miracle of the exponential function
 in general is elon musk so he kind of advocatesthe idea of exponential thinking you
 know realizing that technological development can at leastin the short term
 follow exponential improvement which breaks apart ourintuition our ability to reason about
 what isn't isn't impossible so he's a big one it's a good leadershipkind of style of saying like
 look the thing that everyone thinks is impossible is actually possiblebecause exponentials but
 what what's your sense about um about that kind of way to see the world

0:33:20
Speaker 0 :well so i think it's um it can be very
 inspiring to note when something like moore's lawis another great example where you have
 this exponential pattern that holds shockingly wellum and it enables um just better lives
 to be led i think the people who took moore's law seriouslyin the 60s we're seeing that wow it's
 not going to be too long before like these giant computers that are eitherbatch processing or time shared
 you could actually have one small enough to put on your desk on top of your deskand you could do things
 and if they took it seriously like you have people predicting smartphones likea long time ago
 and it's only out of like kind of this i don't want to say faith in exponentialsbut
 an understanding that that's what's happening what's more interesting ithink is to
 really understand why exponential growth happensand that the mechanism behind it is when
 the rate of change is proportional to the thing in and of itselfso the reason the technology would grow
 exponentially is only going to be if the rate of progress is proportional tothe amount that you have
 so that the software you write enables you to write more softwareand i think we see this with the
 internet like the advent of the internet makes it faster to learn things whichmakes it
 faster to uh create new things i think this is uh oftentimes why likeinvestment will grow exponentially that
 the more resources a company has if it knows how to usethem well the more
 uh the more it can actually grow so i mean you know you reference elon musk ithink
 he seems to really be into vertically integrating his companies i think a bigpart of that is because you have the
 sense what you want is to make sure that the things that you developyou have ownership of and they enable
 further development of the adjacent parts right so it's not just this youyou see a curve and you're
 blindly drawing a line through it what's much more interesting is to ask when doyou have this
 proportional growth property because then you can also recognize when itbreaks down
 like in an epidemic as you approach saturation that would break downas you do anything that skews what that
 proportionality constant is you can make it maybe not break down asbeing an exponential but it can
 seriously slow what that exponential rate is

0:35:21
Speaker 1 :so the opposite of a pandemic
 is you want in terms of ideas you want to minimize barriers that uhprevent the spread you want to maximize
 the spread of impact so like you wanted toto grow when you're doing technological
 development is so that you do hold up that rate holdsup
 and that's all that's almost like a like an operational challenge of likehow you run a company how you run a
 group of people is that any one invention has a ripplethat's unstopped
 and that ripple effect then has its own ripple effects and so on and thatcontinues
 yeah like moore's law is fascinating and thelike on a psychological level on a human
 level because it's not exponential it's it's just aconsistent
 set of like what you would call like s-curveswhich is like it's constantly like
 breakthrough innovations

0:36:17
Speaker 0 :non-stop that's a good point like it
 might not actually be an example of exponential because of something whichgrows in proportion to itself but
 instead it's almost like a benchmark that was set outthat everyone's been pressured to meet
 and it's like all these innovations and microinventions along the way rather than
 some consistent sit back and just let thelily pad grow across the lake phenomenon


0:36:38
Speaker 1 :and it's also there's a human
 psychological level for sure of like the four-minute mile likeit's there's something about it like
 saying that look there is um you know moore's lawit's a law so like it's uh it's
 certainly an achievable thing you know we've achieved it for the lastdecade the last two decades the last
 three decades you just keep going and it somehow makes it happen i mean itmakes people
 i'm continuously surprised in this world how few peopledo the best work in the world
 like in that particular whatever that field is like it's very oftenthat like the genius
 i mean you couldn't argue that community matters but it's certain likei've been in groups of engineers where
 like one person is clearly like doing an incredibleamount of work
 and just is the genius and it's fascinating to seebasically it's kind of the steve jobs
 idea is maybe the whole point is uh to create an atmospherewhere the genius can discover themselves
 like like have the opportunity to do the bestwork of their life
 and yeah and that the exponential is just milking thatit's like rippling the idea that it's
 possible and that idea that it's possible findsthe right people for the four minute
 mile the idea that it's possible finds theright runners to run it
 and then expose the number of people who can run faster than four minutesit's kind of interesting to i don't know
 basically the positive way to see that is most of usare way more intelligent have way more
 potential than we ever realize i guess that's kind of depressing but imean like the ceiling for most of us is
 much higher than we ever realized

0:38:28
Speaker 0 :that is true a a good book to read if
 you want that sense is peak which essentially talks about peakperformance in a lot of different ways
 like you know chess london cab drivers of how manypush-ups people can do short-term memory
 tasks and if there's one it's meant to be likea concrete manifesto about deliberate
 practice and such but the one sensation you come out with iswow no matter how good people are at
 something they can get better and like way betterthan we think they could
 i don't know if that's actually related to exponential growthbut i do think it's a true phenomenon


0:39:01
Speaker 1 :that's interesting yeah i mean
 there's certainly no law of exponential growth in humaninnovation well i don't know


0:39:09
Speaker 0 :well kind of there is like there's i
 think it's really interesting to see when innovations in one field allow forinnovations in another
 like the advent of computing seems like a prerequisite for the advent of chaostheory
 you have this truth about physics and the world thatin theory could be known you could find
 lorenz's equations without computers but in practice it was just never goingto be analyzed that way
 unless you were doing like a bunch of simulations and that you couldcomputationally see these models
 so it's like physics allowed for computers computers allowed for betterphysics
 and you know wash rinse and repeat that self-proportionality that's exponentialso i think
 i wouldn't i don't think it's too far to say that that's a law of some kind

0:39:51
Speaker 1 :yeah a fundamental law of the universe
 is that these descendants of apes willexponentially improve their technology
 and one day take be taken over by the agithat's some that's built in this similar
 they'll make the video game fun whoever created this thinguh so i mean since you're wearing a
 space actually let me let me ask uh so

0:40:12
Speaker 0 :i didn't realize that i apologize


0:40:18
Speaker 1 :yeah so crew dragon the first
 uh crude mission out into space since the the space shuttleand just by first
 time ever by a commercial company i mean it's an incredible accomplishment ithink
 but it's also just an incredible it inspires imagination amongst peoplethat this is the first step
 in a long like vibrant journey of humans into spaceoh yeah so what do you what are your how
 do you feel is this

0:40:53
Speaker 0 :you know is this exciting to you yeah it
 is i think it's great the idea of seeing itbasically done by smaller entities
 instead of by governments i mean it's a it's a heavy collaboration betweenspacex and nasa in this case but moving
 in the direction of not necessarily requiring an entire country and itsgovernment to make it happen
 but that you can have um uh something closer to a single company doing itwe're not there yet
 because it's not like they're unilaterally saying like we're justshooting people up into space um
 it's just a sign that we're able to do more powerful things with smaller groupsof people
 uh i find that inspiring innovate quicklyi hope we see people land on mars in my
 lifetime do you think we will i think so i mean i think there's a tonof challenges there right like radiation
 being kind of the biggest one and i think there's aton of people who uh
 look at that and say why why would you want to do thatlet's let the robots do the science for
 us but i think there's enough people who are like genuinelyinspired about broadening like the
 worlds that we've touched um or people who think about things likebacking up the light of consciousness
 with like super long-term visions of terraforming like as long as

0:41:59
Speaker 1 :there's backing up the light of


0:42:00
Speaker 0 :consciousness yeah yeah the thought that
 uh you know if we if earth goes to hell wegotta have a backup somewhere
 um a lot of people see that as pretty out there and it's like not in the shortterm future but
 i think that's an inspiring thought i think that's a reason to like get up inthe morning and
 i feel like most employees at spacex feel that way too

0:42:18
Speaker 1 :do you think we'll colonize mars one day


0:42:20
Speaker 0 :no idea like either agi kills us first
 or if we're like allowed i don't know if it'll take loudwell like honestly it takes it would
 take such a long time like okay you might have a small colonyright um something like what you see
 in um the martian but not like people livingcomfortably there um but if you want to
 talk about actual like second earth kind ofstuff that that's just like way far out
 there and the future moves so fast that it's hard to predict like we might justkill ourselves before that even becomes
 viable

0:42:53
Speaker 1 :i yeah i mean there's there's a lot of
 possibilities where it could be just it doesn't have to be on a planetwe could be floating out in space
 have uh have a have a space faring backup solution that doesn't have uhthat doesn't have to deal with the
 constraints at a planet but i mean a planet provides a lot of possibilitiesand resources but also
 some constraints yeah i mean for me for some reason it's a deeplyexciting possibility oh yeah


0:43:19
Speaker 0 :all of the people who are like skeptical
 about it or like why why do we care about going to marsit's like what makes you care about
 anything that's not inspiring

0:43:28
Speaker 1 :it's hard actually it's hard to hear
 that because exactly as you put it on a philosophicallevel it's hard to
 say why do anything i don't know it's it's like the people say likeyou know i've been doing like an insane
 challenge last 30 something days your pull-ups and to pull up somepush-ups and like
 you know a bunch of people are like awesome you're insane but awesomeand then some people are like why why do


0:43:59
Speaker 0 :anything


0:44:00
Speaker 1 :i i don't know at this there's a calling
 it's uh i i'm with jfk a little bit is becausewe do these things because they're hard
 there's something in the human spirit that says likesame with like a math problem there's
 something you fail once and it's like this feeling that you knowwhat i'm not going to back down from
 this there's something to be discovered inovercoming this thing


0:44:25
Speaker 0 :well so what i like about it is um and i
 also like this about the moon missions sure is kind of arbitrary but you can'tmove the target so
 you can't make it easier and say that you've accomplished the goal and whenthat happens it just demands actual
 innovation right like protecting humans from theradiation
 in space on the flight there while there heart problemdemands innovation you can't move the
 goal post to make that easier almost certainly the innovationsrequired for things like that will be
 relevant in a bunch of other domains too um so like the idea of doing somethingmerely because it's hard
 it's like loosely productive great but as long as you can't move the goal poststhere's probably going to be these
 secondary benefits that like we should all strive for yeah i

0:45:07
Speaker 1 :mean
 it's hard to formulate the mars colonization problem as something thathas a deadline which is the problem but
 if there was a deadline then the amount of things we would comeup with
 by forcing ourselves to figure out how to colonizethat place would be just incredible
 this is what people like the internet didn't get created becausepeople sat down and tried to figure out
 how do i uh you know uh send tick tock videos ofmyself dancing to people
 they you know it was there's an applicationi mean actually i don't even know what


0:45:46
Speaker 0 :do you think the application for the
 internet was when it was

0:45:48
Speaker 1 :it must have been very low level basic
 network communication within darpa like military based like how do i sendlike a networking how do i send
 information securely between two places maybe it was anencryption
 i'm totally speaking totally outside of my knowledge but likeit was probably intended for a very
 narrow small group of people

0:46:10
Speaker 0 :well so i mean it was there was like
 this small community of people who are really interested in time sharingcomputing and like interactive computing
 in contrast with uh batch processing and then the idea that as you set uplike a time sharing center
 uh basically meaning you have multiple people like logged in and using thatlike central computer um
 why not make it accessible to others yeah and this was kind of what i hadalways thought like oh is this like
 fringe group that was interested in this new kind of computing and they all likegot themselves together
 but the thing is like darpa wouldn't act you wouldn't have the us governmentfunding that just for the funds of it
 right in some sense that's what arpa was all about wasuh like just really advanced research
 for the sake of having advanced research and it doesn't have topay out with utility soon but the core
 parts of its development were happening like in the middle of the vietnam warwhen there was budgetary constraints all
 over the place uh i only learned this recently actuallylike if you look at the documents
 basically justifying the um budget for the arpanet as they were developing itand not just
 keeping it where it was but actively growing it while all sorts of otherdepartments were having their funding
 cut because of the war a big part of it wasnational defense in terms of having like
 a more robust communication system like the idea of packet switching versuscircuit switching you could kind of make
 this case that in some calamitous circumstance whereyou know a central location gets nuked
 uh this is a this is a much more resilient way to still have yourcommunication lines
 that like traditional um telephone lines weren't as resilient to which i justfound very interesting
 that that um even something that we see is so happy-go-lucky is just a bunch ofcomputer nerds trying to get like
 interactive computing out there the actual like thing that made it uhfunded and thing that made it advance
 uh when it did was because of this direct national securityquestion and concern i don't know if


0:48:01
Speaker 1 :you've read it i haven't read it i've
 been meaning to read it but neil degrasse tyson actually came out with abook
 that talks about like science and the context of the military like basicallysaying
 all the great science we've done in the in the 20th centurywas like because of the military i mean
 he paints a positive it's not like a critical it's not youknow a lot of people say like military
 industrial complex and so on another way to see the military andnational security is like a source of
 like you said deadlines and like hard things you can'tmove like almost
 you know almost like scaring yourself into being productive

0:48:38
Speaker 0 :it is that i mean manhattan project is a
 perfect example probably the quintessential example that oneuh is a little bit more macabre than
 others because of like what they were buildingbut in terms of how many focused smart
 hours of human intelligence get pointed towardsa topic per day you're just maxing it
 out with that sense of worry in that contexteveryone there was saying like we've got
 to get the bomb before hitler does and that like that just lights a fireunder you that
 i again like the circumstances macabre but i think that's actually prettyhealthy
 especially for researchers that are otherwise going to be really theoreticalto take these like theorizers and say
 make this real physical thing happen meaning a lot of it is going to beunsexy a lot of it's going to be like
 young firemen sitting there kind of inventinga notion of computation in order to like
 compute what they needed to compute more quickly with like the rudimentaryautomated tools that they had available
 i think you see this with bell labs also where you've gototherwise very theorizing minds in very
 pragmatic contexts that i think is like really helpful forthe theory as well as for the
 applications uh so i think that stuff can bepositive for progress you mentioned bell


0:49:49
Speaker 1 :labs and manhattan project
 this kind of makes me curious for the things you'vecreate which are quite singular like if
 you look at all youtube or just not youtube it doesn't matterwhat it is it's just teaching
 content art doesn't matter it's like yup that'sthat's grant right that's unique i know
 your teaching style and everything does it manhattan projectand bell labs was like famously a lot of
 brilliant people but there's a lot of themthey play off of each other so like my
 question for you is that does it get lonely

0:50:28
Speaker 0 :honestly that right there i think is the
 biggest part of my life that i would like tochange in some way that uh i i look at
 a bell labs type situation and i'm like god damn i love thatwhole situation and i'm so jealous of it
 and you're like reading about hamming and then you see that he also shared anoff with with shannon and you're like of
 course he did of course they shared an office that's how these ideas get like

0:50:51
Speaker 1 :and they actually very likely worked
 separately yeah totally fine totally separate but there's a literallyi'm sorry to interrupt there's a
 literally magic that happens when you run into each otherlike on the way to like get getting a
 snack or something conversations you overhear

0:51:05
Speaker 0 :it's other projects you're pulled into
 it's like puzzles that colleagues are sharing like all of thatum i i have some extent of it just
 because i just try to stay well connected incommunities of uh people who think in
 similar ways but it's not it's not in the day-to-dayin the same way
 which i would like to fix somehow that's

0:51:25
Speaker 1 :one of the
 i would say uh one of the biggest well uh one of the many umdrawbacks negative things about this
 current pandemic is that uh whatever the term is but likechance collisions
 are significantly reduced i i saw um

0:51:44
Speaker 0 :i don't know why i saw this but on my on
 my brother's work calendar uh he had a scheduled slot with someoneum that he scheduled a meeting and the
 the title of the whole meeting was no specific agenda i just missed thehappenstance serendipitous conversations
 that we used to have which the pandemic and remote work has socruelly taken away from us
 brilliant that was the only title of the match i'm like that's the way to do ityou just schedule those things
 schedule the serendipitous interaction

0:52:13
Speaker 1 :it's like i mean you can't do an
 academic setting but it's basically like going to a barand sitting there just for the strangers
 you might meet just the strangers or striking up aconversation with strangers on the train
 harder to do when you're deeply like maybe myself or maybe a lot ofacademic types
 who are like introverted and avoid human contact as much as possibleso it's nice when it's forced those
 chance collisions but maybe scheduling is a possibility but for themost part do you
 work alone like i'm sure you struggle like a lot like like thislike this you probably hit moments when
 you you look at this and you say like this is the wrong way toshow it it's a long way to visualize it
 i'm making it too hard for myself i'm going down the wrong direction thisis too long this is too short
 all those self-doubt that's like could be paralyzingokay what do you do in those honestly


0:53:12
Speaker 0 :i actually much prefer like work to be a
 solitary affair for me that's like a personality quirki would like it to be in an environment
 with others and like collaborative in the sense of ideas exchangedbut those phenomena you're describing
 when you say this is too long this is too short this visualization sucksit's way easier to say that to yourself
 than it is to say to a collaborator um and i know that's just a thing thati'm not good at so
 in that way it's it's very easy to just throw away a script because the scriptisn't working
 it's hard to tell someone else they should do the same actually last time we

0:53:43
Speaker 1 :talked i think it was like
 very close to me talking don knuth it was kind of coollike two people that yes you got that


0:53:49
Speaker 0 :interview yeah


0:53:51
Speaker 1 :it's the heart hit uh no can i brag
 about something please uh my favorite thing is don knuth afterhe did the interview
 he offered to go out to hot dogs with me to get hot dogsthat was never like people ask me what's
 the favorite interview you've ever done man that has to beum but unfortunately i couldn't i had a
 thing after so i had to turn down don knuth

0:54:13
Speaker 0 :you missed knuth dogs
 canoe dogs sorry so that was a little

0:54:16
Speaker 1 :bragging but the the hot dog is such a
 sweet so um but the reason i bring that up is hehe works through problems alone as well
 he prefers that struggle the struggle of it you knowwriters like stephen king you know often
 talk about like their process of you know what they do like what they eatwhen they wake up
 like uh when they sit down like how they like their deskyou know on a on a perfectly productive
 day like what they like to do how long theylike to work for
 what enables them to think deeply all that kind of stuff umhunter s thompson did a lot of drugs uh
 you know everybody has their own thing uh what's do you have a thing is thereif you were to lay out a perfect
 productive day what would that schedule look like doyou think


0:55:12
Speaker 0 :part of that's hard to answer because i
 like um the mode of work i do changes a lotfrom day to day like some days i'm
 writing the thing i have to do is write a script some days i'm animating thething i have to do is animate
 sometimes i'm like working on the animation library the thing i have to dois like
 a little i'm not a software engineer but something in the direction of softwareengineering
 some days it's like a variant of research it's like learn this topic welland try to learn it differently
 so those is like four very different modes of what itsome days is like get through the email
 backlog of people i've been the tasks i've been putting off um it

0:55:47
Speaker 1 :goes research scripting
 like the idea starts with the research and then there's scriptingand then there's programming and then
 there's the uh

0:55:56
Speaker 0 :show time and the research side by the
 way like what's i think a problematic way to do it is tosay i'm starting this project
 and therefore i'm starting the research instead it should be that you're likeambiently learning a ton of things
 just in the background and then once you feel like you have the understanding forone you put it on the list of things
 that there can be a video for otherwiseeither you're gonna end up roadblocked
 forever or you're just not gonna like have a good way of talking about itum
 but still some of the days it's like the thing to do is learn new things

0:56:24
Speaker 1 :so what's the most painful one i think
 you mentioned scripting

0:56:28
Speaker 0 :scripting is yeah that's the worst yeah
 right writing is the worst so what's your

0:56:32
Speaker 1 :on a perfectly so let's take the hardest
 one what's a perfectly productive day you wake up and it's like damn it thisis the day i need to do some scripting
 and like you didn't do anything last two days so you came up with excuses toprocrastinate so today must be the day


0:56:47
Speaker 0 :yeah i uh i wake up early i i guess i
 exercise um and then uh i turn the internet offif we're writing yeah that's that's
 what's required um is having the internet off and thenmaybe you keep notes on the things that
 you want to google when you're allowed to have the internet againi'm not great about doing that but when
 i do uh that makes it happen and then when i hit writer's blocklike the solution to writer's block is
 to read it doesn't even have to be relatedjust read something different just for
 like 15 minutes half an hour and then go back to writingum that when it's a nice cycle i think
 can work very well

0:57:22
Speaker 1 :and when you when you're writing the
 script you don't know where it ends right like you have a like problem

0:57:27
Speaker 0 :solving videos i know where it ends
 expositional videos i don't know where

0:57:32
Speaker 1 :it ends like coming up with uh
 with the magical thing that makes this whole story like ties this whole storytogether
 is that when does that happen that's

0:57:40
Speaker 0 :that's the thing that makes it such that
 a topic gets put on the list of like oh that's an issue you shouldn't startthe project unless there's one of those


0:57:49
Speaker 1 :uh and you have you have so many nice
 bag that you haven't such a big bag of aha moments already that you could justpull at it
 that's one of the things and one of the sad things about time and that nothinglasts forever
 and that we're all mortal let's not get into that um

0:58:07
Speaker 0 :

0:58:08
Speaker 1 :discussion uh is you know
 if i see like even when i ask for people to asklike ask i did a call for questions and
 people want to ask you questions i mean so many requests from people about likecertain videos that would love you to do
 it's such a pile and i i think that's a that's a sign of likeadmiration from people for sure
 but it's like it makes me sad because like whenever i see them people giveideas they're all like
 very often really good ideas and it's likeit's such a makes me sad in the same
 kind of way when i go through a library or through abookstore you see all these amazing
 books that you'll never get to open so so yeah so so you yeah gotta enjoy

0:58:55
Speaker 0 :the ones that you have
 enjoy the books that are open and don't let yourselflament the ones that stay closed what


0:59:02
Speaker 1 :else is there any other magic to that
 day do you try to dedicate like a certainnumber of hours
 do you uh uh cal newport has this deep work

0:59:12
Speaker 0 :kind of idea i'm there's systematic
 people who like get really on top of you know the checklist of whatthey're going to do in the day and they
 like count their hours and i am not a systematic person in thatway it's which is probably a problem
 i very likely would get more done if i was systematic in that waybut that doesn't happen um so
 you know maybe you talk to me talk to me later in life and maybe i'llhave like changed my ways and give you a
 very different answer

0:59:37
Speaker 1 :i think benjamin franklin like later in
 life figured out the rigor he has these like very rigorousschedules and what how how to be


0:59:44
Speaker 0 :productive i think those schedules are
 much more fun to write like it's very fun tolike write a schedule and make a blog
 post about like the perfect productive dayum that like might work for one person
 but i don't know how much people get out of like reading them or trying toadopt someone else's style and i'm not


0:59:58
Speaker 1 :even sure that they've ever followed


1:00:01
Speaker 0 :yeah exactly you're always going to
 write it as the best version of yourself um you're not going to explain thephenomenon of like wanting to get out of
 the bed but not really wanting to get out of bedand all of that and just like zoning out


1:00:13
Speaker 1 :for random
 reasons or or the one that people probably don't touch at all isi try to check social media once a day
 but i'm like only so i post and that's it when ipost i checked the previous days
 that's like my what i try to do uh that's what i do like 90 of the days butthen i'll go i'll have like a
 two week period where it's just like i'm checkingthe internet like i mean it's some
 probably some scary number of times

1:00:43
Speaker 0 :and i think a lot of people can resonate
 with that i think it's a legitimate addiction it's like it's a dopamineaddiction and
 it's i don't know if it's a problem because as long as it's the kind ofsocializing like if you're actually
 engaging with friends and engaging with other people's ideasuh i think it can be really useful well


1:01:00
Speaker 1 :i don't know so like
 for sure i agree with you but i'm it's a it's definitely an addictionbecause for me i think it's true for a
 lot of people i am very cognizant of the fact i justdon't feel that happy
 if i look at a day where i've checked social media a lotlike if i just aggregate i did a
 self-report i'm sure i would find that i'm just like literally on likeless happy with my life
 and myself after i've done that check when i check it once a dayi'm very like i'm happy
 even like because i've seen it okay one way to measure that is when somebodysays something not nice to you on the
 internet it's like when i check it once a day i'mable to just like
 like i smile like like i virtually i think about them positivelyempathetically i send him love i don't
 don't ever respond but i just feel positively about the whole thingif i check if i check like more than
 that it starts eating at me like it startthere's an eating thing that that
 happens like anxiety uh it occupies a part of your mindthat's not doesn't seem to be healthy
 same with um i mean you you put stuff out on youtubei think it's important i think you have
 a million dimensions that are interesting to you butyeah one one of the interesting ones is
 the study of education and the psychological aspectof putting stuff up on youtube
 i like now have completely stopped checkingstatistics of any kind i've released an
 episode uh 100 with my dad conversation with my dadhe checks
 he's probably listening to this stop he checks the number of views on his onhis video
 on his conversation so he discovered like a reason he's new to this wholeaddiction
 and he just checks and he like he'll text me or write to me i just passed

1:02:59
Speaker 0 :dawkins


1:03:02
Speaker 1 :

1:03:05
Speaker 0 :yeah so he's uh oh can i tell you a
 funny story in that effect of like parental use of youtube uh early on inthe channel
 uh my mom would like text me she's like uh the chat the channel has had 990 000views
 the channel's had 991 thousand views i'm like oh that's cute she's going to thelittle part on the about page where you
 see the total number of channel views no she didn't know about that she hadbeen going
 every day through all the videos and then adding them upadding them up and she thought she was
 like doing me this favor of providing me this like global analytic thatuh otherwise wouldn't be visible it's
 just like this addiction where you have some number you want to followand then like yeah it's funny that your
 dad had this i think a lot of people have it i think that's

1:03:46
Speaker 1 :probably a beautiful thing for like
 parents because they're legitimately they're proud

1:03:53
Speaker 0 :yeah they're yes it's born of love it's
 great

1:03:56
Speaker 1 :the downside i feel one one of them is
 this is one [Music]interesting experience that you probably
 don't know much about because comments on your videos are superpositive uh but
 people judge the quality of how something wentlike i see that with these conversations
 by the comments yeah like i'm not talking about likeyou know people in their 20s and their
 30s i'm talking about like ceos of major companieswho don't have time they basically they
 literally this is their evaluation metric they'relike oh the comments seem to be positive
 that's really concerning to me most

1:04:35
Speaker 0 :important lesson for any content creator
 to learn is that the commenting public is not representative of the actualpublic
 and this is easy to see ask yourself how often do you write comments on youtubevideos
 most people will realize i never do it some people realize they dobut the people who realize they never do
 it should understand that that's a sign the kind of people who are like youaren't the ones leaving comments
 and i think this is important a number of respects like uh in my case i think iwould think my content was better than
 it was if i just read comments because peopleare super nice the thing is
 the people who um are bored by it are are put off by it in some way orfrustrated by it
 usually they just go away they're certainly not going to watch the wholevideo much less
 leave a comment on it so there's a huge under-representation of likenegative feedback like well-intentioned
 negative feedback because very few people actively do that like watch thewhole thing that they dislike
 figure out what they disliked articulate what they dislike umthere's plenty of negative feedback
 that's not well-intentioned but for like that golden kind i think a lotof
 youtuber friends i have uh at least have gone through phases of like anxietyabout
 the nature of comments um that stem from basically just this that it's likepeople who aren't necessarily
 represented who they were going for or misinterpreted what they'retrying to say or whatever have you or
 we're focusing on things like personal appearancesas opposed to like substance and they
 come away thinking like oh that's what everyone thinksright that's what everyone's response to
 this video was but a lot of the people who had the reaction you wanted them tohave
 like they probably didn't write it down sovery important to learn it also uh
 translates to um realizing that you're not as importantas you might think you are right because
 all of the people commenting are the ones who love you the most and are likereally asking you to like create certain
 things or like mad that you didn't create like a past thingum i don't i have such a problem
 like i have a very real problem with making promises about a type of contentthat i'll make and then
 either not following up on it soon or just like never following up on it yeah

1:06:35
Speaker 1 :you actually last time we talked i think
 prom i'm not sure promised to me that you'll have music incorporated into yourlike uh i'll share with you a private


1:06:41
Speaker 0 :link but so there's an example of like
 what i had in mind i like did a version of itum and i'm like i think there's a better
 version of this that might exist one day

1:06:51
Speaker 1 :so it's now on the like the back burner
 it's like it's sitting there

1:06:56
Speaker 0 :it was like a live performance at this
 one thing i think next next circumstance that i'm like doing another recordedlive performance that like
 fits having that then in a better recording maybe i'll make it nice andpublic maybe a while
 but exactly right um the point i was gonna make though is like i know i'm badabout following up on stuff
 uh which is an actual problem it's born of the fact that ihave a sense of what will be like good
 content when it won't be um but this can actually be incrediblydisheartening because a ton of comments
 that i see are people who are like uh frustratedusually in a benevolent way that like
 i haven't followed through on like x and x which i get and i shoulddo that but what's comforting thought
 for me is that when there's a topic i haven't promised but i am working on andi'm excited about
 it's like the people who would really like this don't know that it's comingand don't know to like
 comment to that effect and like the commenting public that i'm seeing is notrepresentative of like
 who i think this other project will touch meaningfully yeah so focus on the

1:07:50
Speaker 1 :future on the thing you're creating now
 just like the uh yeah the art of it one of the people is reallyinspiring to me in that regard because
 i've really seen it in persons um joe rogan hedoesn't read comments but not just that
 he doesn't give a damn he like legitimatehe's not like clueless about it he's
 like just like the richness and the depth ofa smile he has
 when he just experiences the moment with you like offlineyou can tell he doesn't give a damn
 about like like about anything about what peoplethink about whether if it's on a podcast
 you talk to him or whether offline about just it's not there likewhat other people think
 how how uh even like what the rest of the day looks like it's justdeeply in the moment uh or like
 especially like is is what we're doing gonna make for agood instagram photo or something like
 that it doesn't think like that at all it'si think for actually quite a lot of
 people he's an inspiration in that way but it wasand in real life a show that you can be
 very successful not giving a damn about um aboutcomments
 and it sounds it sounds bad not to read comments because it's likewell there's a huge number of people who
 are deeply passionate about what you do so you're what ignoring them but at thesame time
 the nature of our platforms is such that the cost of listening to all thepositive people who are really close to
 you who are incredible people have been you knowmade a great community that you can
 learn a lot from the cost of listening to those folks is alsothe cost of your psychology slowly being
 degraded by the natural underlying toxicity of theinternet


1:09:47
Speaker 0 :engage with a handful of people deeply
 rather than like as many people as you can in a shallow wayi think that's a good lesson for social
 media usage um

1:09:56
Speaker 1 :like platforms in general yeah choose


1:09:58
Speaker 0 :choose just a handful of things to
 engage with and engage with it very well in a way that you feel proud ofand don't worry about the rest honestly
 i think the best social media platform is textingthat's my favorite that's my go-to
 social media platform well

1:10:12
Speaker 1 :yeah the best social media interactions
 like real life not social media but social interaction

1:10:18
Speaker 0 :well yeah no no question there i think
 everyone should agree with that

1:10:21
Speaker 1 :which sucks because uh it's been
 challenged now with the current situationand we're trying to figure out what kind
 of platform can be created that we can do remote communication that still iseffective
 it's important for education it's important for just that's the question

1:10:35
Speaker 0 :of education right now


1:10:38
Speaker 1 :yeah so on that topic you've done a
 series of live streams called lockdown mathand you know you went live which is
 different than you usually do maybe one can you talk about how'd thatfeel
 what's that experience like like in your own when you look back likeis that an effective way did you find
 being able to teach and if so is there lessons for this world whereall of these educators
 are now trying to figure out how the heck do i teach remotely

1:11:11
Speaker 0 :for me it was very different as
 different as you can get i'm on camera which i'm usually not i'm doing it livewhich is
 nerve wracking um it was a slightly different likelevel of topics although realistically
 i'm just talking about things i'm interested in no matter whati think the reason i did that was this
 thought that a ton of people are looking to learn remotely the rate whichi usually put out content is too slow to
 be actively helpful let me just do some bi-weekly lecturesthat if you're looking for a place to
 point your students if you're a student looking for a place to be edified aboutmath
 just tune in at these times um and in that sense i think it wasyou know a success for those who
 followed with it it was a really rewarding experience for me to see howpeople
 engaged with it part of the fun of the live interaction was to actuallylike i'd do these live quizzes and see
 how people would answer and try to shape the lesson based on that or see whatquestions people were asking in the
 audience i would love to if i did more thingslike that in the future kind of tighten
 that feedback loop even more um i think for you know you ask aboutlike if this can be relevant to
 educators like 100 online teaching is basically aform of live streaming now
 um and usually it happens through zoom i thinkif teachers view what they're doing as a
 kind of performance and a kind of live stream performance um that wouldprobably be pretty healthy because
 zoom can be kind of awkward um and i wrote up this little blog post actuallyjust on like
 just what our setup looked like if you want to adopt it yourself and how tointegrate um
 like the broadcasting software obs with zoom or things like that

1:12:39
Speaker 1 :it was really sorry to pause on that i
 mean yeah maybe we could look at the blog post butit looked really nice the thing is i


1:12:45
Speaker 0 :knew nothing about any of that stuff
 before i started i had a friend who knew a fair bitum and so he kind of helped show me the
 roots one of the thing that i realized is that you could as a teacherlike it doesn't take that much to make
 things look and feel pretty professional um like one component of it is as soonas you hook things up with a
 broadcasting software rather than just doing like screensharing you can set up different scenes
 and then you can like have keyboard shortcuts to transition between thosetwo
 scenes so you don't need a production studio with a director calling like goto camera three go to camera two like
 onto the screen instead you can have control of that andit took a little bit of practice and i
 would mess it up now and then but i think i had itdecently smooth such that
 you know i'm talking to the camera and then we're doing something on the paperthen we're doing like a
 um playing with a desmos graph or something andsomething that i think in the past would
 have required a production team you can actually do as a solo operationand in particular as a teacher and i
 think it's worth it to try to do that becauseuh two reasons one you might get more
 engagement from the students but the biggest reason i think one ofthe like best things that can come out
 of this pandemic education-wise is if we turn a bunch of teachers intocontent creators and if we take
 lessons that are usually done in these one-off settings and likestart to get in the habit of sometimes
 i'll use the phrase commoditizing explanation where what you want iswhatever a thing a student wants to
 learn it just seems inefficient to me thatthat lesson is taught
 millions of times over in parallel across many different classrooms in theworld like year to year you've got a
 given algebra 1 lesson that's just taughtlike literally millions of times by
 different people what should happen is that there's thesmall handful of explanations online
 that exist so that when someone needs that explanation they can go to itthat the time in classroom is spent on
 all of the parts of teaching and education that aren't explanation whichis most of it
 right um and the way to get there is to basically have morepeople who are already explaining
 publish their explanations and have it in a publicized forumso if during a pandemic you can have
 people automatically creating online contentbecause it has to be online
 but getting in a habit of doing it in a in a way that doesn't just feel likea zoom call that happened to be recorded
 but it actually feels like a a piece that was always going to bepublicized to more people than just your
 students that can be really powerful and there's

1:15:05
Speaker 1 :an improvement process there like
 so being self-critical and growing like you knowlike i guess youtubers go through this
 process of like putting out some content and like nobodycaring about it and then trying to
 figure out like basically improving figure out like whydid nobody care
 uh uh what can i you know and they come up with all kinds of answers which mayor may not be correct
 but doesn't matter because the answer leads to improvementso you're being constantly self-critical
 or self-analytical it should be better to say so you think of like howcan i make the audio better
 like all the basic things maybe one one question to askbecause uh well by way of uh russ
 dedrick he's a robotics professor at mit one ofmy favorite people
 a big fan of yours uh he watched our first conversation i justinterviewed him a couple weeks ago
 he uh he teaches this course in under-actuated roboticswhich is um like robotic systems when
 you can't control everything like when you're like we as humans when wewalk we're
 always falling forward which means like it's gravity you can't control it youjust hope you can catch yourself but
 that's not all guaranteed it depends on the surface so like that'sunder-actuated you can't control
 everything all the the number of actuators uhthe degrees of freedoms you have is not
 enough to fully control the system so i don't know it's a really i thinkbeautiful fascinating class he puts it
 online um it's quite popular he does anincredible job teaching he puts online
 every time but he's kind of been interested in likecrisping it up like
 you know making it uh you know innovating in different kinds of waysand he was inspired by
 the work he do because i think in his work he can dosimilar kind of explanations as you're
 doing like revealing the beauty of it and spending like months and preparing asingle video
 uh and he's interested in how to do that that's why he listened to theconversation he's playing with madam
 but he had this question of you know um of uh you know like in my apartmentwhere
 we did the interview i have like curtains likethe for like a black curtain not this
 uh this is this is a adjacent mansion that we're in that i also but

1:17:29
Speaker 0 :

1:17:30
Speaker 1 :you basically just i have like a black
 curtain whatever that you know makes it really easy to set up a filmingsituation with
 cameras that we have here these microphones he was askingyou know what kind of equipment do you
 recommend i guess like your blog post is a good one i said i don'trecommend
 this is excessive and actually really hard to work withso i i wonder i mean
 is there something you would recommend in terms of equipment like isis it direct do you think like lapel
 mics like usb mics what do you for my narration i use

1:18:00
Speaker 0 :a usb mic for the streams that used a
 lapel mic uh the narration it's a blue yeti um i'mforgetting actually the name of the
 lapel mic but it was probably like a road of some kind um

1:18:14
Speaker 1 :but is it hard to figure out how to make
 the audio sound good

1:18:17
Speaker 0 :oh i mean listen to all the early videos
 on my channel and clearly like i'm terrible at this for for somereason um
 i just couldn't get audio for a while i think i it's weird when you hear yourown voice yeah so here you're like this
 sounds weird and it's hard to know does it soundweird because you're not used to your
 own voice or they're like actual audio artifacts at play umso uh and then video is just


1:18:39
Speaker 1 :for the lockdowns just the camera like
 you said it was probably streaming somehow through the

1:18:45
Speaker 0 :yeah there were two gh5 cameras one that
 was mounted overhead over a piece of paper you could also uselike an ipad or a wacom tablet to do
 your writing um electronically but i just wanted thepaper feel um
 on on the face there's two um again i don't know i'm like just notactually the one to ask this because i
 like animate stuff usually but uh each of them like has a compressorobject
 that makes it such that the camera output goes into the computerusb but like gets compressed before it
 does that the the live aspect of it

1:19:14
Speaker 1 :do you do you regret doing it live


1:19:20
Speaker 0 :not at all um i think i do think the
 content might be like much less sharp and tight than if itwere um
 something even that i just recorded like that and then edited laterbut i do like something that i do to be
 out there to show like hey this is what it's like raw this is what it's likewhen i make mistakes
 this is like the pace of thinking um i like the live interaction of it i thinkthat made it better
 i probably would do it on a different channel i think if i didseries like that in the future just
 because it's it's a different style it's probably a different target audience andkind of keep clean what three blue and
 brown is about versus uh the benefits of like live lectures

1:19:57
Speaker 1 :do you uh suggest like in this time of
 covid that people like russ or other educatorstry to go
 like the the shorter like 20 minute videos that are likereally well planned out or scripted you
 really think through you slowly design so it's not live doyou see like that being an important
 part of um what they do yeah well what i think

1:20:21
Speaker 0 :teachers like russ should do
 is um choose the small handful of topics that they're going to do just reallywell they want to create the best
 short explanation of it in the world that will be one of those handfulsin a world where you have commoditized
 explanation right most of the lectures shouldbe done just normally um still put
 thought and planning into it i'm sure he's awonderful teacher and like knows all
 about that but maybe choose a small handful of topicsum do what beneficial for me sometimes
 if i do sample lessons with people on that topic to get some sense ofhow other people think about it let that
 inform how you want to edit it or script it or whatever formatyou want to do some people are
 comfortable just explaining it and editing later i'm more comfortable likewriting it out and thinking in that
 setting

1:21:03
Speaker 1 :yeah it's kind of sorry to interrupt uh
 it's it's a little bit sad to me to see how much knowledge is lost like justjust like you mentioned
 there's professors like we can take my dad for exampleto blow up his ego a little bit but he's
 a great teacher and he knows plasma plasma chemistryplasma physics really well so he can
 very simply explain some beautiful but otherwise uh complicated conceptsand it's sad that like if you google
 plasma or like for plasma physics like there'sno videos


1:21:38
Speaker 0 :and just imagine if every one of those
 excellent teachers like your father like russ um even if they just chose onetopic this year
 they're like i'm gonna make the best video that i can on this topic if everyone of the great teachers did that
 the internet would be replete and it's already replete with great explanationsbut it would be even more so with all
 the niche great explanations and like anything you want to learn and

1:21:58
Speaker 1 :there's a self-interest to it for in
 terms of teachers in terms of even so if you take ross forexample
 it's not that he's teaching something like he teacheshis main thing his thing he's deeply
 passionate about and from a selfish perspective it's alsojust like
 i mean it's a it's a it's like publishing a paper in a reallylike nature has like letters like
 accessible publication it's just going to guarantee that yourwork
 that your passion is seen by a huge number of people whatever thedefinition of huge is
 doesn't matter it's much more than it otherwise uh

1:22:42
Speaker 0 :would be and it's those lectures that
 tell early students what to be interested in yeahat the moment i think students are
 disproportionately interested in the things that are well represented onyoutube
 so to any educator out there if you're wondering hey i want more like gradstudents in my department
 like what's the best way to recruit grad students it's like make the best videoyou can and then wait eight years
 and then you're gonna have a pile of like excellent grad students for thatdepartment


1:23:05
Speaker 1 :and one of the lessons i think your
 channel teaches is there's appeal ofexplaining just something beautiful
 explaining it cleanly technically not doing a marketing videoabout why topology is great
 there's yeah that's the there's people

1:23:22
Speaker 0 :interested in this stuff yeah i mean
 uh one of the greatest channels like mattit's not even a math channel but the
 channel with greatest math content is vsauceyeah you like interviewed if imagine you
 were to propose making a video that explains the binochtarsky paradoxsubstantively
 right not not shying around it maybe not describing things in terms ofum like the group theoretic terminology
 that you'd usually see in a paper but the actualuh results um that went into
 this idea of like breaking apart a sphere proposing that to like a networktv station
 saying yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna do this in-depth talk of the binocular skiparadox i'm pretty sure it's gonna reach
 20 million people it's like get out of here like no no onecares about that no one's interested in
 anything even anywhere near that but then you havemichael's quirky personality around it
 and just people that are actually hungry for that kind of depth umthen you don't need like the approval of
 some higher network you can just do it and let thepeople speak for themselves
 so i think you know if your father was to make something on plasma physicsor um if we were to have like uh
 underactualized robotics under actuated under actuatedyes not underactualized plenty
 actualized under-actuated robotics yeah most

1:24:37
Speaker 1 :robotics is under actualized current


1:24:40
Speaker 0 :that's true so even if it's things that
 you might think are niche i bet you'll be surprised by how manypeople um
 actually engage with it really deeply

1:24:49
Speaker 1 :although i just psychologically watching
 him i can't speak for a lot of people i speak for my dadi think there's a there's a little bit
 of a skill gap but i think that could be overcomethat's pretty basic you know what none


1:25:00
Speaker 0 :of us know how to make videos
 when we start the first step i made was terrible in a number of respects likelook at the earliest videos on any
 youtube channel except for captain disillusion and they're all liketerrible versions of whatever they are
 now

1:25:13
Speaker 1 :but the thing i've noticed especially
 like with world experts is it's the same thing that i'm sure youwent through which is like
 um fear of like embarrassment like they theydefinitely it's it's the same reason
 like i feel that anytime i put out a videoi don't know if you still feel that but
 like i don't know it's this impostor syndrome like who am i totalk about this and that that's true for
 like even things that you've studied for like yourwhole life uh i don't know
 it's scary to post stuff on youtube it is scary

1:25:50
Speaker 0 :uh i honestly wish that more of the
 people who had that modesty to say who am i to postthis
 were the ones actually posting it that's right i mean the honest problem is likea lot of the educational content is
 posted by people who like we're just starting to research ittwo weeks ago and are on a certain
 schedule and who maybe should think like who am ito
 explain and choose your favorite topic quantum mechanics or somethingum and the people who have the
 self-awareness uh to not post are probably the peoplealso best positioned to give
 a good honest explanation of it that's

1:26:27
Speaker 1 :why there's uh
 a lot of value in a channel like numberphile where they basically trapa really smart person and force them to
 explain stuff on a broad sheet of paper so but of course that's not scalable asa single channel
 if they if there's anything beautiful that they could be done aspeople take it in their own hands uh
 educators

1:26:48
Speaker 0 :which is again circling back i do think
 the pandemic will serve to force a lot of people's hands you'regonna be making online content anyway
 it's happening right just hit that publish button and see how it goes

1:27:02
Speaker 1 :yeah see how it goes the cool thing
 about youtube is it might not go for a while but like10 years later
 right yeah it'll be like this the thing thiswhat people don't understand with
 youtube at least for now at least that's myhope with it is uh it's a leg it's a
 it's literally better than publishing a book in terms of the legacyit's it will live for a long long time
 of course it's uh one of the things i mentioned joe rogan before it's kind ofthere's a sad thing because i'm a fan
 he's moving to spotify yeah

1:27:38
Speaker 0 :yeah nine digit numbers will do that to
 you yeah but he doesn't really

1:27:42
Speaker 1 :that he's one a person that doesn't
 actually care that much about money like having talked to him he it itwasn't because of money
 it's because he legitimately thinks that they're going to dolike a better job like so they're
 so from his perspective youtube you have to understand where they're coming fromyoutube has been cracking down on
 people who they you know joe rogan talks to alex jones and conspiracy theoriesand youtube was really like careful that
 kind of stuff and that's not a good feeling like andjoe didn't doesn't feel like youtube was
 on his side um you know he's often has videos thatthey don't put in trending
 that like are obviously should be in trending because they're nervousabout like you know if this concept is
 this is this content uh going to you knowupset people that all that kind of stuff
 have misinformation and that's not a good place for a personto be in
 and spotify is giving them uh we're never going to censor youwe're never going to do that but the
 reason i bring that up whatever you think about that ipersonally think that's [ __ ] because
 podcasting should be free and not constrained to a platform it'spirate radio what the hell
 you can't as much as i love spotify you can't justyou can't put fences around it
 but uh anyway the reason i bring that up is uh joe's going to remove his entirelibrary from youtube


1:29:14
Speaker 0 :whoa really that's going to his


1:29:15
Speaker 1 :full-length the clips are going to stay
 but the full-length videos are all i mean made private or deletedthat's part of the deal and like that's
 the first time where i was like oh youtube videos might not live foreverlike things you find
 like okay sorry this is why you need um

1:29:33
Speaker 0 :ipfs or something where it's like if
 there's a content link are you familiar with this system at alllike right now if you have a url that
 points to a server there's like a system where the addresspoints to content and then it's like
 distributed so you you can't actually delete what'sat an address because it's
 it's content addressed and as long as there's someone on the network who hostsit
 it's always accessible at the address that it once was um

1:29:57
Speaker 1 :but i mean that raises a question i'm
 not going to put you on the spot but like somebody like vsauceright spotify comes along and gives him
 let's say 100 billion dollars okay let's say some crazy numberand then removes it from youtube right
 it's maybe i don't knowfor some reason i thought youtube is
 forever i don't think it will be

1:30:20
Speaker 0 :i mean you know another variant that
 this might take is like uh that you know um you fast forward 50years and
 uh you know google or alphabet isn't the company that it once was and it's kindof struggling to make ends meet and you
 know it's been supplanted by the whoever wins on the ar game orwhatever it might be
 and then they're like you know all of these videos that we're hosting arepretty costly so
 we're just we're going to start deleting the ones that aren't watched that muchand
 tell people to like try to back them up on their own or whatever it isum or even if it does exist in some form
 forever it's like if people are um not habituated to watching youtube in50 years they're watching something else
 which seems pretty likely like it would be shocking if youtuberemained as popular as it is now
 indefinitely into the future that's true so uhit won't be forever it makes me sad


1:31:10
Speaker 1 :still but
 because it's such a nice it's like just like you saidof the canonical videos sorry i don't


1:31:17
Speaker 0 :interrupt you know
 you should get juan bennett on the uh on the thing and then talk to him aboutpermanence
 i think you would have a good conversation who's that so he's the onethat founded this thing called ipfs that
 i'm talking about and if you have him talkabout basically what you're describing
 like oh it's sad that this isn't forever then you'll get some articulatequantification around it
 yeah that's like been pretty well thought through uh but yeah i do see

1:31:39
Speaker 1 :youtube
 just like you said as a as a place like what your channel creates which is likea set of canonical videos on a topic now
 others could create videos on that topic as well but as acollection it creates
 a nice set of places to go if you're curious about a particular topicand it seems like coronavirus is a nice
 opportunity to put that knowledge out there in theworld at
 mit and beyond i have to talk to you a little bit about machine learningdeep learning and so on again we talked
 about last time you have a set of beautiful videos onyour networks
 uh let me ask you first what is the most beautiful aspect of neural networksand machine learning to you like
 for making those videos from watching how the field is evolvingis there something mathematically
 or an applied sense just beautiful to you about them

1:32:42
Speaker 0 :well i think what i would go to is the
 layered structure and how um you can have what feel likequalitatively distinct things happening
 going from one layer to another but that are um following the samemathematical rule because you look at it
 as a piece of math it's like you got a non-linearity and then you'vegot a matrix multiplication that's
 what's happening on all the layers um but especially if you look at likesome of the visualizations that
 like chris ola has done with respect to like convolutional nets that have beentrained on imagenet trying to say what
 does this neuron do what do this does this family of neurons do what youcan see is that
 the ones closer to the input side are picking up on very low level ideas likethe texture
 right and then as you get further back you have higher level ideas like what isthe
 where the eyes in this picture and then how do the eyes form likean animal is this animal a cat or a dog
 or a deer you have this series of qualitatively different thingshappening even though it's the same
 piece of math on each one so that's a pretty beautiful idea thatyou can have like a generalizable
 object that runs through the layers of abstractionwhich in some sense constitute
 intelligence as having um those many different layers of anunderstanding to something yeah form


1:33:55
Speaker 1 :abstractions in a
 automated way exactly it's automated

1:33:58
Speaker 0 :abstracting
 which i mean that just feels very powerfuland the idea that it can be so simply
 mathematically represented i mean a ton oflike modern email research seems a
 little bit like you do a bunch of ad hoc thingsthen you decide which one worked and
 then you retrospectively come up with the mathematical reason that it alwayshad to work
 um but you know who cares how you came to it when you have like that elegantpiece of math
 uh it's hard not to just smile seeing it work in action well and when you talked

1:34:25
Speaker 1 :about topology before
 one of the really interesting things is it's beginning to be investigated underkind of the field of like science and
 deep learning which is like the craziness of the surfacethat uh is trying to be optimized uh
 in neural networks i mean the the amount of localminima local optima there is in these
 surfaces and somehow a dumb gradient descentalgorithm is able to find really good
 solutions that's like that's really surprising well so on the

1:34:59
Speaker 0 :one hand it is but also it's like not
 it's not terribly surprising that you have these interesting points that existwhen you make your space so high
 dimensional like gpt3 what did it have 175 billion parametersso it it doesn't feel as
 mesmerizing to think about oh there's some surface ofintelligent behavior in this crazy
 high-dimensional space it's like there's so many parameters that of coursebut what's more interesting is like how
 how is it that you're able to efficiently get therewhich is maybe what you're describing
 that something as dumb as gradient descentdoes it but like the re the reason the
 gradient descent works well with neural networks and not just youknow choose however you want to
 parameterize the space and then like apply gradient descent to itis that that layered structure lets you
 decompose the derivative in a way that makes it computationally feasible

1:35:48
Speaker 1 :um yeah it's just that that there's so
 many good solutions probably infinitely infinitely manygood solutions not best solutions but
 good solutions that's that's what's interesting it'ssimilar to uh
 stephen wolfram has this idea of like the if you just look at all space ofcomputations
 of all space of basically algorithms that you'd be surprised how many of themare actually intelligent
 like if you just randomly pick from the bucketthat's surprising we tend to think like
 a tiny tiny minority of them would be intelligent but his sense is likeit seems weirdly easy to find
 computations that do something interesting well okay so

1:36:33
Speaker 0 :that from like a common gore kolmogorov
 complexity standpoint almost everything will be interestingwhat's fascinating is to find the stuff
 that's describable with low information butstill does interesting things
 uh like one fun example of this you know um shannon's noisy coding in theoremuh noisy coding theorem and uh
 information theory that basically says if you know i wantto send some bits to you
 uh maybe uh some of them are gonna get flipped uh there's some noise along thechannel
 i can come up with some way of coding it that's resilient to that noisethat's very good um and then he
 quantitatively describes how very good iswhat's funny about how he proves the
 existence of good error correction codes is rather than saying like here's how toconstruct it or even like a sensible
 non-constructive proof the nature of his non-constructive proof is to sayum if we chose a random encoding it
 would be almost at the limit which is weirdbecause then it took
 decades for people to actually find any that were anywhere close to the limitand what his proof was saying is choose
 a random one and it's like the best kind of encoding you'll everfind but what's
 what that tells us is that sometimes when you choose a random element fromthis ungodly huge set
 that's a very different task from finding an efficient way to activelydescribe it
 because in that case the random element to actually implement it as a bit ofcode you would just have this huge
 table of like um telling you how to encode one thing into another that'stotally computationally infeasible
 so on the side of like how many possible programs are interestingin some way it's like yeah all tons of
 them but the much much more delicate question is when youcan have a low information description
 of something that still becomes interesting and thereby that kind of

1:38:14
Speaker 1 :gives you a blueprint for how to
 engineer that kind of thing

1:38:19
Speaker 0 :right yeah chaos theory is another good
 instance there where it's like yeah a ton of things are hard todescribe but how do you have ones that
 have a simple set of governing equations that remain likearbitrarily hard to describe


1:38:30
Speaker 1 :well let me ask you uh you mentioned
 gpt3 it's interesting to ask uh what are your thoughts about therecently
 released openai gbt3 model that i believe is already trying to learnhow to communicate like grant sanderson


1:38:47
Speaker 0 :you know i think
 i got an email a day or two ago about someone who wanted to umtry to use gpd3 with manum where you
 would like give it a high-level description of somethingand then it'll like automatically create
 the mathematical animation like trying to put me out of a job here

1:39:05
Speaker 1 :i mean it probably won't put you out of
 a job but it'll create something visually beautiful for sure

1:39:10
Speaker 0 :i would be surprised if that worked as
 stated but maybe there's like variants of it like that you can get toum


1:39:17
Speaker 1 :i mean like a lot of those demos it's
 interesting i think uh there's a lot of failed experimentslike depending on how you prime the
 thing you're going to have a lot of failed i'mcertainly with code no program synthesis
 most of it won't even run but eventually i think if youif you're if you pick the right examples
 you'll be able to generate something cooland i think even that's good enough even
 though if if it's if you're being very selective it's stillcool that something can be generated


1:39:47
Speaker 0 :yeah that that's huge value um i mean
 think of the writing process sometimes a big part of it is just getting a bunchof stuff on the page and then you can
 decide what to whittle down to so if it can be used in like aman-machine symbiosis where
 it's just giving you a spew of potential ideas that then you can refine downum like it's serving as the generator
 and then the human serves as the refiner that seems like a pretty powerfuldynamic


1:40:10
Speaker 1 :yeah have you uh have you gotten a
 chance to see any of the demos like on twitteris there a favorite you've seen or oh my


1:40:16
Speaker 0 :absolute favorite
 yeah uh so tim blay who runs a channel called a cappella science he waslike tweeting a bunch about playing with
 it um and so he so gpt3 was trained on um theinternet from
 before kovid so so in a sense it doesn't know about the coronavirusso what he seeded it with was just a
 short description about like um a novel virusuh emerges in wuhan china and starts to
 spread around the globe what follows is a month by monthdescription of what happens january
 colon right that's what he sees it with sothen what gpt3 generates is like
 january then a paragraph of description february and suchand it's the funniest thing you'll ever
 read because um it predicts a zombie apocalypsewhich of course it would because it's
 trained on like the internet zombie stories but what you seeunfolding is a description of
 covet 19 if it were a zombie apocalypse and like the early aspects of it arekind of shockingly
 in line with what's reasonable and then it gets out of hand so quickly

1:41:15
Speaker 1 :and the other flip side of that is uh i
 wouldn't be surprised if it's on to something at some pointhere when you know 2020
 has been full of surprises who knows

1:41:24
Speaker 0 :like we might
 i'll be in like this crazy militarized zoneas it predicts just a couple months off
 yeah i think is

1:41:32
Speaker 1 :this definitely an interesting tool of
 storytelling it has struggled with mathematics whichis interesting or in just even numbers
 it's able to it's not able to generate likepatterns you know like you give it um
 in like five digit numbers and it's not able to figure out the sequenceyou know or like uh i didn't look in
 too much but i'm talking about like sequences like the fibonaccinumbers and to see how far it can go
 because obviously it's leveraging stuff from the internetand it starts to lose it but it is also
 cool that i've seen it able to generate some interestingpatterns um that are mathematically
 correct

1:42:12
Speaker 0 :yeah i i honestly haven't dug into like
 what's going on within it uh in a way that i can speakintelligently to
 i guess it doesn't surprise me that it's bad at numerical patterns becausei mean maybe i should be more impressed
 with it but like that requires having um a weird combination of intuitiveand uh and formulaic worldview
 so you're not just going off of intuition when you see fibonacci numbersyou're not saying like intuitively what
 do i think will follow the 13. like i've seen patterns a lot where like13s are followed by 21s
 instead it's the like the way you're starting to see a shape of thingsis by knowing what hypotheses to test
 where you're saying oh maybe it's generated based onthe previous terms or maybe it's
 generated based on like multiplying by a constant or whatever it is you likehave a bunch of different hypotheses
 and your intuitions are around those hypotheses but you still need toactively
 test it um and it seems like gpt3 is extremely good at umlike that sort of pattern matching
 recognition that usually is very hard for computersthat um is what humans get good at
 through expertise and exposure to lots of thingsit's why it's good to learn from as many
 examples as you can rather than just from the definitionsit's to get that level of intuition but
 to actually concretize it into a piece of math you do need tolike test your hypotheses and if not
 prove it um like have an actual explanation forwhat's going on not just a
 a pattern that you've seen yeah and but

1:43:38
Speaker 1 :then the flip side to play devil's
 advocate that's a very kind of probably correctintuitive understanding of
 just like we said a few a few layers creating abstractionsbut it's been able to form
 something that looks like a a compression of the data that it's seenthat looks
 awfully a lot like it understands what the heck is talking about

1:44:03
Speaker 0 :well i think a lot of understanding is
 like i don't mean to uh denigrate pattern recognition patternrecognition is most of understanding and
 it's super important and it's super hard um and so like when it's demonstratingthis kind of real understanding
 compressing down some data like that that might bepattern recognition at its finest
 my only point would be that like what differentiates mathi think to a large extent is that um the
 pattern recognition isn't sufficient and that the kind of patterns thatyou're recognizing are
 not like the end goals but instead they're they are the little bits andpaths that get you to the end goal


1:44:39
Speaker 1 :so that's only true for mathematics in
 general it's an interesting question if that might for certain kinds of seriesof numbers
 it might not be true like you might because that's a basicyou know like taylor's like certain
 kinds of series it feels like compressing the internet uhis is enough to figure out because those
 patterns in some form appear in the text somewhere well i mean

1:45:06
Speaker 0 :there's there's all sorts of wonderful
 examples of false patterns in math where um one of the earliest videos i put onthe channel was talking about
 you're kind of dividing a circle up using these chords and you see thispattern of one two four eight sixteen i
 was like okay pretty easy to see what that pattern isit's powers of two you've seen it a
 million times um but it's not powers of two the nextterm is thirty one
 and so it's like almost a power of two but it's a little bit shyand there's there's actually a very good
 explanation for what's going on um but i think it's a good test of whetheryou're thinking
 clearly about mechanistic explanations of thingshow quickly you jump to thinking it must
 be powers of two because the problem itself there's really nono good way to i mean there can't be a
 good way to think about it as like doubling a set because ultimatelyit doesn't but even before it starts to
 it's not something that screams out as being a doublingphenomenon so at best if it did turn out
 to be powers of two it would have only been so very subtlyand i think the difference between like
 you know a math student making the mistake and a mathematician who'sexperienced
 seeing that kind of pattern is that they they'll have a sense from what theproblem itself is
 whether the pattern that they're observing is reasonable and how to testit
 and like uh i would just be very impressed if there was any algorithmthat
 um was actively accomplishing that goal

1:46:25
Speaker 1 :yeah like a learning based algorithm


1:46:28
Speaker 0 :yeah like a little scientist i guess
 yeah basically

1:46:30
Speaker 1 :yeah it's a it's a fascinating thought
 because gpg three these language models are alreadyaccomplishing way more than i've
 expected so i'm learning not to doubt but i bet

1:46:42
Speaker 0 :we'll get there
 yeah i'm not saying i'd be impressed but like surprised like i'll be impressedbut i
 i think we'll get there on um algorithms doing math like that

1:46:52
Speaker 1 :so one of the amazing things you've done
 for the world is to some degree open sourcingthe tooling that you use to make your
 videos with madam this python library now it's quicklyevolving
 because i think you're inventing new things every time you make a videoin fact i wanted um i've been working on
 playing around with something i wanted to do like an ode three blue one brownlike i love playing hendrix
 i want to do like a cover you know of a concept i wanted to visualize andand use madam and i saw that you had
 like a little piece of code on like mobius stripand i tried to do some cool things with
 spinning a mobius strip like continue um twisting it i guess is the termuh and it was easier to uh
 it was tough so i haven't figured out yet well so i guess the question i wantto ask
 is so many people love it uh that you've put that out there they want to uh dothe same things they do with hendrix
 they want to cover it they want to explain an idea using the toolincluding russ how would you recommend
 they try to i'm very sorry they try to gothey try to go by uh about it
 well so and what kind of choices should they chooseto be most effective oh that i can


1:48:13
Speaker 0 :answer so
 i always feel guilty if this comes up because um i think of it like thescrappy tool
 that's like a math teacher who put together some code people asked what itwas so they made it open source
 and they kept scrapping it together and there's a lot like a lot of things aboutit that make it harder to work with than
 it needs to be that are a function of like me not beinga software engineer um
 i i've put some work this year trying to like make itbetter and more flexible um that is
 still just kind of like a work in process um one thing i wouldlove to
 do is just get my act together about properly integrating with what like thecommunity wants to work with
 and like what stuff i work on and making thatum not like deviate uh and just like
 actually fostering that community in a way that i'vei've been like shamefully neglectful of
 so i'm just always guilty if it comes up

1:49:03
Speaker 1 :so let's put that guilt aside just okay
 send like all right

1:49:06
Speaker 0 :i'll pretend like it isn't terrible for
 someone like russ um i think step one is like make sure thatwhat you're animating should be done so
 programmatically because a lot of things maybe shouldn't um like if you're justmaking a quick graph of something
 if it's a graphical intuition that maybe has a little motion to ituse desmos use grapher use geogebra use
 mathematica certain things that are like reallyoriented around ground georgia is kind
 of cool

1:49:30
Speaker 1 :

1:49:31
Speaker 0 :it's amazing you can get very very far
 with it um and in a lot of ways like it would make more sense for some stuffthat i do to just do in geogebra
 but i kind of have this cycle of liking to try to improve mana by doing videosand such so
 do as i say not as i do the original like thought i had in making manam wasthat there's so many different ways of
 representing functions other than graphs um in particular things liketransformations like use
 movement over time to communicate relationships between inputs and outputsinstead of like x direction and y
 direction or like vector fields or things likethat so i wanted something that was
 flexible enough that you didn't feel constrained into a graphical environmentby graphical i mean like graphs with uh
 like x coordinate y coordinate kind of stuffbut also make sure that um you're
 taking advantage of the fact that it's programmatic you have loops you haveconditionals you have abstraction
 if any of those are like well fit for what you want to teach toyou know have a scene type that you
 tweak a little bit based on parameters or to have conditionals so that thingscan go one way or another or loops so
 that you can create these things of like arbitrarily increasingcomplexity that's the stuff that's like
 meant to be animated programmatically if it's just like writing some text onthe screen or shifting around objects or
 something like that um things like that you should probablyjust use keynote
 right um you'll be a lot simpler so try to find a workflow that distillsdown that which should be programmatic
 into manum and that which doesn't need to beinto like other domains again do as i
 say not as i do i mean python is an integral part of

1:51:01
Speaker 1 :it
 and just for the fun of it let me ask uh what uhwhat's your most and least favorite
 aspects of python oh most and least i mean i love that

1:51:12
Speaker 0 :it's like
 object-oriented and functional i guess that you can kind of likeget both of those um uh benefits
 for how you structure things so if you just want to quickly whip somethingtogether the functional aspects are nice
 it's your primary language like for

1:51:28
Speaker 1 :programmatically generating stuff yeah
 it's home

1:51:31
Speaker 0 :for me by calling home yeah sometimes


1:51:34
Speaker 1 :you travel but it's home got it it's
 home

1:51:37
Speaker 0 :uh i mean the biggest disadvantage is
 that it's slow so when you're doing computationally intensive thingseither you have to like think about it
 more than you should how to make it efficientor that just like takes long do you run


1:51:47
Speaker 1 :into that at all like with your work


1:51:50
Speaker 0 :well so uh certainly old man is like way
 slower than it needs to be because of uh how it renders things on the back endis like kind of absurd
 i've rewritten things such that it's all done with like shaders in such a waythat it should be just like live and
 actually like interactive while you're um coding it ifyou want to to you know you have like a
 3d scene you can move around you can have um elements respond to where yourmouse is or things
 that's not something that user of a video is going to get to experiencebecause there's just a play button and a
 pause button but while you're developing that can be niceum so it's gotten better in speed in
 that sense but that's basically because the hard work is being done in thelanguage that's not python but
 glsl right um but yeah there are some times when it's like a umthere's just a lot of data that goes
 into the object that i want to animate that then it just like python is slow

1:52:41
Speaker 1 :well let me ask quickly ask what do you
 think about the walrus operator if you're familiar with it at allthe reason it's interesting there's a
 new operator in python 3.8 i find it psychologically interestingbecause it the toxicity over it led
 guido to resign to step down from this actually true or

1:52:56
Speaker 0 :was it like there's a bunch of
 surrounding things that also was it actually the walrus operator thatwell


1:53:03
Speaker 1 :it was it was a text it was an
 accumulation of toxicity but that was the the most that was themost toxic one
 like the discussion that's the most number of python core developers thatwere opposed to guido's decision
 um he didn't particularly i don't think cared about either wayhe just thought it was a good idea this
 is where you approve it and like the structure of the idea of abdfl is like
 you listen everybody hear everybody out you make a decision and you move forwardand he didn't like the
 negativity that burdened him after that people like

1:53:38
Speaker 0 :some parts of the benevolent dictator
 for life mantra but once the dictator does things different than you wantsuddenly dictatorship doesn't seem so
 great

1:53:45
Speaker 1 :yeah i mean they still liked it he just
 couldn't because he truly is the bee in the benevolent he's really hereally is a nice guy he
 i mean and i think he can't it's a lot of toxicity it's difficult it's adifficult job
 that's why alana's terrible is perhaps the way he is you have to have a thickskin
 to fight off fight off the warring massesit's kind of surprising to me how many
 people can like threaten to murder each other overwhether we should have braces or not or
 whether like it's incredible yeah i mean that's

1:54:15
Speaker 0 :my knee-jerk reaction to the walrus
 operator is like i don't actually care that much either way i'm not going toget irritably passionate my my initial
 reaction was like yeah this seems to make things moreconfusing to read but then again so does
 list comprehension until you're used to itso like if there's a use for it great if
 not great but like let's just all calm down about ourspaces versus tabs debates here
 and like be chill yeah to me just

1:54:38
Speaker 1 :represents
 the uh the value of great leadership even in open source communities

1:54:44
Speaker 0 :does it represent that if he stepped
 down as a leader well

1:54:48
Speaker 1 :he fought for no he got it passed i
 guess but

1:54:50
Speaker 0 :i i guess right it could represent


1:54:52
Speaker 1 :multiple things too it can represent
 like failed dictatorships or it could it could represent a lot of things but tome
 great leaders take risks even if it even if it's a mistake at the end likeyou have to make decisions
 the thing is this world won't go anywhere if youconst if whenever there's a divisive
 thing you wait until the division is no longerthere like that's the paralysis we
 experience with like congress and political systemsit's good to be slow when there's
 indecision uh when there's a people disagree it's good to take yourtime but like at a certain point it
 results in paralysis and you just have to make a decisionthe background of the site whether it's
 yellow blue or red can cause people to like goto war over each other
 i've seen this with design people are very touchy on colorcolor choices at the end of the day just
 make a decision and go with it i think that that's whatthe walrus
 operator represents to me is it represents the fighter pilot instinct of

1:55:55
Speaker 0 :like
 quick action is more important than uh

1:56:00
Speaker 1 :than just like caring everybody out and
 really thinking through it because that's going to lead toparalysis yeah like if that's the actual


1:56:06
Speaker 0 :case that you know
 it's something we're consciously hearing people's uh disagreementdisagreeing with that disagreement and
 um saying he wants to move forward anywaythat's an admirable aspect of leadership


1:56:21
Speaker 1 :so we don't have much time but i want to
 ask just because it's uh some beautifulmathematics involved
 2020 brought us a couple of in the physics world uh theories ofeverything
 eric weinstein kind of i mean he's been working forprobably decades but he put out this
 idea of geometric unity or started sort ofpublicly thinking and talking about it
 more stephen wolfram put outhis physics project which is kind of
 this hypograph view of the theory of everythingdo you uh find uh interesting beautiful
 things to these theories of everything what doyou think about the physics world and
 sort of uh the beautiful interesting insightfulmathematics
 in in that world whether we're talking about quantum mechanics which youtouched on in a bunch of your videos a
 little bit quaternions like just the mathematicsinvolved or general relativity
 which is more about surfaces and topology all that stuff

1:57:19
Speaker 0 :well i think um as far as like
 popularized science is concerned people are more interested in theoriesof everything than they should be
 like because the problem is whether we're talking abouttrying to make sense of weinstein's
 lectures or wolfram's project or let's just say likelistening to uh witten talk about string
 theory whatever proposed path to a theory ofeverything um
 you're not actually going to understand it some physicists will but likeall you're just not actually going to
 understand the substance of what they're sayingwhat i think is way way more productive
 is to let yourself get really interested in the phenomena that are still deep butwhich you have a chance of understanding
 because the path to getting to like even understanding what questions thesetheories of everything are trying to
 answer involves like walking down that i mean iwas watching a video before i came here
 about from steve mold talking about um whysugar polarizes light in a certain way
 so fascinating like really really interesting it's notlike this novel theory of everything
 type thing but to understand what's going on there reallyrequires digging in in depth to
 certain ideas and if you let yourself think past what the video tells youabout
 what does circularly polarized light mean and things like that it actuallywould get you to a pretty good
 appreciation of like two state states and quantum systemsum in a way that just trying to read
 about like oh what's the what are the hard partsabout resolving quantum field theories
 with general relativity is never gonna get you so as far aspopularizing science is concerned
 like the audience should be less interested than they arein theories of everything um the
 popularizers should be less emphatic than they are about thatfor like actual practicing physicist
 you know it might be the case maybe more people should think about fundamentalquestions


1:59:04
Speaker 1 :but it's difficult to create uh like a
 three blue one brown video on the theory of everything so basicallywe should really try to find the beauty
 and mathematics of physics by looking at concepts that are like within reach yeah

1:59:19
Speaker 0 :i think that's super important i mean
 so you see this in math too with um the big unsolved problems so like theclay millennium problems riemann
 hypothesis um have you ever done a video on

1:59:29
Speaker 1 :fermat's last name no i have not


1:59:30
Speaker 0 :yet no but if i did do you know what i
 would do i would talk about um proving foreign theorem in thespecific case of n equals three
 okay is that still accessible though yes actuallybarely um mathologer might be able to do
 like a great job on this he does a good job of taking stuff that's barelyaccessible and making it
 but the the core ideas of proving it for n equals three are hardbut they do get you real ideas about
 algebraic number theory um it involves looking at a number fieldthat's uh it lives in the complex plane
 it looks like a hexagonal lattice and you start asking questions aboutfactoring numbers in this hexagonal
 lattice so it takes a while but i've talkedabout this sort of like lattice
 arithmetic in other contexts and you can get to aokay understanding of that and the
 things that make fairmont's last theme hard are actually quite deepum and so the cases that we can solve it
 for it's like you can get these broad sweepsbased on some hard but like accessible
 bits of number theory but before you can even understand why the general case isas hard as it is you have to walk
 through those and so any other attempt to describe itwould just end up being like shallow and
 not really productive for the viewers timei think the same goes for uh most like
 unsolved problem type things where i think you know as a kid i was actuallyvery inspired by the twin prime
 conjecture um that like totally sucked me in as thisthing that was understandable i kind of
 had this dream like oh maybe i'll be the one to prove the twin prime conjectureand new math that i would learn would be
 like viewed through this lens of like oh maybe i can apply it to that insome way but uh
 you sort of mature to a point where you realize thatyou should spend your brain cycles on
 problems that you will see resolved because then you're going togrow to see what it feels like for these
 things to be resolved rather than spending your brain cycles on somethingwhere it's not it's not going to pan out
 and the people who do make progress towards these things like james maynarduh is a great example here of like young
 creative mathematician who like pushes in the direction of thingslike the twin prime conjecture
 rather than hitting that head on just see all the interesting questions thatare hard for similar reasons but become
 more tractable and let themselves really engage with thoseso i think people should get in that
 habit i think the popularization of physics should encourage that habitthrough things like the physics of
 simple everyday phenomena because it can get quite deep and umyeah i think you know i've heard a lot
 of the interest that you know people send me messages asking to explainweinstein's thing or asking to explain
 wolfram's thing one i don't understand them but moreimportantly um
 you shouldn't be interested in those right it's a giant

2:02:10
Speaker 1 :sort of uh ball of interesting ideas
 there's probably a million of interesting ideas in therethat individually could be explored
 effectively and to be clear you should be interested in fundamental questions i

2:02:19
Speaker 0 :think that's a good habit to ask what
 the fundamentals of things are but i think it takes a lot of stepsto like certainly you shouldn't be
 trying to answer that unless you actually understand quantum field theoryand you actually understand general
 relativity that's the cool thing about like your

2:02:34
Speaker 1 :videos people who haven't done
 mathematics like if you really give it time watch ita couple of times and like
 try to try to reason about it you can actually understand the concept that'sbeing explained


2:02:45
Speaker 0 :and it's not a coincidence that the
 things i'm describing aren't like the most um up-to-date uh progresson the riemann hypothesis
 cousins or um like there's context in which the analog of the roman hypothesishas been solved in like more
 uh discrete feeling finite settings that are more well-behavedi'm not describing that because it just
 takes a ton to get there and instead i think it'll be likeproductive to have an actual
 understanding of something that can you can pack into 20 minutes ithink that's beautifully put


2:03:14
Speaker 1 :ultimately that's where like the most
 satisfying thing is when you really understandum yeah really understand build a habit


2:03:21
Speaker 0 :of feeling what it's like to actually
 come to resolution yeah yeah as opposed

2:03:26
Speaker 1 :to
 which it can also be enjoyable but just beingin awe of the fact that you don't
 understand anything yeah that's not like

2:03:34
Speaker 0 :i don't know maybe people get
 entertainment out of that but

2:03:37
Speaker 1 :it's not as fulfilling as understanding
 you won't grow yeah and but also just the fulfilling itreally does feel good when you
 first don't understand something and then you do that's a beautiful feelinghey let me ask you one last last time we
 got awkward and weird about uh a fear of mortality which you madefun of me off but let me ask you on the
 the other absurd question is um what do you think isuh the meaning of our life of meaning of
 life i'm sorry if i made fun of you about

2:04:08
Speaker 0 :

2:04:10
Speaker 1 :much no you didn't i'm just joking
 it was it was great i don't think life has a meaning

2:04:14
Speaker 0 :i think like meaning i don't understand
 the question i think meaning is something that'sascribed to stuff that's created with
 purpose there's a meaning to uh like this waterbottle label in that someone created it
 with the purpose of conveying meaning and there was like one consciousnessthat wanted to get its ideas into
 another consciousness um most things don't have that propertyit's a little bit like if i asked you
 um like what is the height

2:04:40
Speaker 1 :all right so it's all relative yeah


2:04:42
Speaker 0 :you'd be like the height of what
 you can't ask what is the height without an object you can't ask what is themeaning of life
 without like an intentful consciousness putting itlike i guess i'm revealing i'm not very
 religious but you know the mathematics of

2:04:55
Speaker 1 :everything seems kind of beautiful
 it seems like it seems like there's some kind of structurerelative to which i mean you could
 calculate the height well so but what i'm saying is i don't

2:05:08
Speaker 0 :understand the question what is the
 meaning of life in that i think people might be asking something veryreal i don't understand what they're
 asking are they asking like why does life exist like how did it comeabout what are the natural laws
 are they asking um as i'm making decisions day by day for what should ido
 what is the guiding light that inspires like what should i do i think that'swhat people are kind of asking but also


2:05:28
Speaker 1 :like why
 the thing that gives you joy about education about mathematics what thehell is that
 like what interactions with other people

2:05:38
Speaker 0 :interactions with like-minded people i
 think is the meaning of in that sense bringing others joy

2:05:45
Speaker 1 :essentially like
 in something you've created it connects with others somehowand the same and the vice versa i think


2:05:53
Speaker 0 :that that is what
 um when we use the word meaning to mean like you're sort of filled with a senseof
 happiness and energy to create more things like i have so much meaningtaken from this like that yeah that's
 what fuels fuels my pump at least

2:06:07
Speaker 1 :so a life alone on a deserted island
 will be kind of meaningless yeah you want to be alone together with

2:06:11
Speaker 0 :someone
