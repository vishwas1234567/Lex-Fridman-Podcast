Speaker 1 :following is a conversation with
 Sebastian Thrun he's one of the greatest roboticists computer scientists andeducators of our time he led the
 development of the autonomous vehicles at Stanford that one 2005 DARPA GrandChallenge and placed second in the 2007
 DARPA urban challenge he then led the Google self-driving car program whichlaunched the self-driving car revolution
 he taught at the popular Stanford course on artificial intelligence in 2011 whichwas one of the first massive open online
 courses or MOOCs as they're commonly called that experience led him toco-found Udacity an online education
 platform if you haven't taken courses on it yet I highly recommended theirself-driving car program for example is
 excellent he's also the CEO of Kitty Hawk acompany working on building flying cars
 are more technically Evie tall's which stands for electric vertical takeoff andlanding aircraft he has launched several
 revolutions and inspired millions of people but also as many know he's just areally nice guy it was an honor and a
 pleasure to talk with him this is the artificial intelligencepodcast if you enjoy subscribe I need to

 side project for me as many people know but I still put a lot of effort into itso the positive words of support from an
 amazing community from you really helped I recently started doing ads at the endof the introduction I'll do one or two
 minutes after introducing the episode and never any ads in the middle they canbreak the flow of the conversation I
 hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience I provide timestamps for the start of the conversation
 that you can skip to but it helps if you listen to the ad and support thispodcast by trying out the product

 personally use cash up to send money to friends but you can also use it to buysell and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds
 cash app also has a new investing feature you can buy fractions of a stocksay $1 worth no matter what the stock
 price is brokerage services are provided by cash app investing a subsidiary ofsquare and member has site PC I'm
 excited to be working with cash app to support one of my favorite organizationscalled first best known for their first
 robotics and Lego competitions they educate and inspire hundreds ofthousands of students in over 110
 countries and have a perfect rating and charity navigator which means thedonated monies used the maximum
 effectiveness when you get cash out from the App Store or Google Play and usecoal export gas you'll get ten dollars
 in cash up we'll also donate ten dollars the first which again is an organizationthat I've personally seen inspired girls
 and boys the dream of engineering a better world and now here's myconversation or Sebastian Thrun you
 mentioned that the matrix may be your favorite movie so let's start with thecrazy philosophical question do you
 think we're living in a simulation and in general do you find the thoughtexperiment interesting define simulation


0:03:39
Speaker 0 :I would say maybe we are not but it's
 completely irrelevant to the way we

0:03:46
Speaker 1 :should act putting aside for a moment
 the fact that it might not have any impact on how we should act as humanbeings for people studying theoretical
 physics these kinds of questions might be kind of interesting looking at theuniverse's information processing system


0:04:03
Speaker 0 :the universe is an information
 processing system is a huge physical biological chemical computer there's noquestion but I live here and now I care
 about people okay about us what do you think is trying to compute and I thinkthere's an intention I think it just the
 world evolves the way it devolves and it's it's beautiful is unpredictable andI'm really grateful to be alive
 spoken like a true human which last time I checked that was oh that in fact this

0:04:33
Speaker 1 :whole conversation is just a touring
 test to see if if indeed if indeed you

0:04:38
Speaker 0 :are you've also said that one of the


0:04:40
Speaker 1 :first programs of the first few programs
 you've written was a wait for a TI 57

0:04:48
Speaker 0 :calculator yep


0:04:50
Speaker 1 :maybe that's early eighties I don't


0:04:51
Speaker 0 :

0:04:51
Speaker 1 :

0:04:52
Speaker 0 :wanna date calculators anything early
 eight is correct yeah so if you were to

0:04:56
Speaker 1 :place yourself back into that time into
 the mindset you are in because you have predicted the evolution of computing AIthe internet technology in in the


0:05:09
Speaker 0 :decades that followed I was super
 fascinated by Silicon Valley which I seen on television once and thought mygod this is so cool they build like D
 Rams there and CPUs how cool is that and as a college students a few year later afew days later I decided to be study
 intelligence and study human beings and found that even back then in the 80s and90s that artificial intelligence is what
 fascinated me the most I was missing is that back in the day the computers arereally small they're like the brains you
 could build well not anywhere bigger as a cockroach and cock-horse aren't verysmart so we weren't at the scale yet
 where we are today

0:05:46
Speaker 1 :did you dream at that time to achieve
 the kind of scale we have today did that

0:05:52
Speaker 0 :seem possible I always wanted to make
 robots smart I felt it was super cool to build an artificial human and the bestway to build not official you want to be
 a robot because that's kind of the closest if you could do unfortunately wearen't there yet there were words today
 are still very brittle about as fascinating to study intelligence from aconstructive perspective it built


0:06:12
Speaker 1 :something to understand you build what
 do you think it takes to build an intelligent system and an intelligent

0:06:19
Speaker 0 :robot I think the biggest innovation
 that we've seen as machine learning and it's the idea that their computers canBC teach themselves
 let's give an example I'd say everybody pretty much knows what a wok and welearn how to walk in the first year two
 of our lives but no scientist has ever been able to write on the rules of humangait we don't understand that we can't
 put we have in our brain somehow we can practice it we understand it that we canarticulate that we can't pass it on by
 language and that to me is kind of a deficiency of today's computerprogramming even you could program a
 computer they're so insanely dumb that you have to give them rules for everycontingencies very unlike the way people
 learn but learn from data and experience computers are being instructed andbecause it's so hard to get this
 instruction set right we pay software engineers two hundred thousand dollars ayear now the most recent innovation
 which has been to make for like 3040 years is an idea that computers can findtheir own rules so they can learn from
 falling down and getting up the same way children can learn from falling down andgetting up and that revolution has led
 to a capability that's completely unmatched today's computers can watchexperts do their jobs whether you're a
 doctor or lawyer pick up the regularities learn those rules and thenbecome as good as the best experts so


0:07:39
Speaker 1 :the dream of in the 80s of expert
 systems for example had at its core the idea that humans could boil down theirexpertise on a sheet of paper so sort of
 reduce sort of be able to explain to machines how to do something explicitly

0:07:56
Speaker 0 :so do you think what's the use of human


0:07:56
Speaker 1 :expertise into this whole picture do you
 think most of the intelligence will come from machines learning from experiencewithout human expertise input so the


0:08:06
Speaker 0 :question for me is much more how to
 express expertise um you can express expertise providing a book you canexpress expertise by showing someone
 what you're doing you can express expertise by applying it by by manydifferent ways and I think the expert
 systems was our best attempt in AI to capture expertise in rules there someonesat down and say here the rules of human
 gait here's when you put your big toe forward and your heel backwards andYahoo stop stumbling and as we now know
 the set of rules a set of language that he can command is incredibly limitedthe human brain doesn't deal with
 language it is with that subconscious numerical perceptual things that wedon't even ever survey off
 now when a AI system watches an expert do their job and practice their job itcan pick up things that people can't
 even put into writing into books or rules and that's where the real power iswe now have AI systems that for example
 look over the shoulders of highly paid human doctors like dermatologist orradiologists and they can somehow pick
 up those skills that Noah can express in

0:09:17
Speaker 1 :words so you were a key person in
 launching three revolutions online education and Thomas vehicles and flyingcars or vetoes so high level and I


0:09:30
Speaker 0 :

0:09:31
Speaker 1 :apologize for all the philosophical


0:09:33
Speaker 0 :questions that's no policy necessary how


0:09:36
Speaker 1 :do you choose what problems to try and
 solve drives you to make those solutions

0:09:43
Speaker 0 :a reality I have two two desires in life
 I want to literally make the lives of others better or as few of them saymaybe joke indeed what make the world a
 better place if you believe in us it's as funny as it sounds and second I wantto learn I want to get in the circus I
 don't want to be in a dropping with it because if I meant job that I'm good atthe chance for me to learn something
 interesting is actually minimized so I want to be in a job I'm bad at that'sreally important to me so I'm in a bill
 for example but people often call flying cars is that electrical vertical takeoffand landing vehicles I'm just no expert
 in any of this and it's so much fun tool to learn on the job what actually meansto build something like this now it's
 saying that the stuff that I done lately after I finished my professorship atStanford the video focused on like what
 has the maximum impact on society like transportation is something hastransformed the 21st 20th century more
 than any other invention of my opinion even more than communication and citiesare different workers different women's
 rights are different because of transportation and yet we still have avery suboptimal transportation solution
 where we kill 1.2 or so million P every year in traffic it's like theleading cause of death for young people
 in many countries we have here extremely inefficient resource wise just go toyour average neighborhood city and look
 at the number of parked cars that's a travesty in my opinion or where we spendendless hours in traffic jams and very
 very simple innovations like a self-driving car or what people call aflying car could completely change this
 and it's there I mean the technology is it's basically there yet close your eyesnot to see it


0:11:26
Speaker 1 :so lingering on autonomous vehicles
 fascinating space some incredible work you done throughout your career there solet's start we'll start with DARPA
 I think the DARPA challenge there's a desert and then urban to the streets Ithink that inspired an entire generation
 of roboticists and obviously sprung this whole excitement about this particularkind of four wheeled robots were called
 autonomous cars self-driving cars so you led the development of Stanley theautonomous car that one that erased the
 desert the DARPA challenge in 2005 and junior a car that I finished second inthe DARPA Grand Challenge also did
 incredibly well in 2007 I think what are some painful inspiring or enlighteningexperiences from that time that stand


0:12:20
Speaker 0 :out to you oh my god painful were all
 these incredibly complicated stupid bugs that had to be found we had a face wherethe stanley hour or carded i eventually
 won the DARPA Grand Challenge but every 30 miles just commit suicide and wedidn't know why and it ended up to be
 that in the sinking of two computer clocks occasionally a clock wentbackwards and that negative time elapsed
 screwed up the entire internal logic but it took ages to find this they were likebugs like that I'd say enlightening is
 the Stanford team immediately focused on machine learning and on software where'severybody else seem to focus on building
 better hardware our knowledge had been you a human being with an existingrental car can
 we drive the course I have to might have to build a better rental car I justbuilt it should replace the human being
 and the human being to me was a conjunction of three steps we hadextensors eyes and ears
 mostly eyes we had brains in the middle and then we had actuators our hands inour feet now the extras I used to build
 the sensors like she also use it a bit what was missing was the brain so he hadto build a human brain and nothing
 nothing clear them to me that that the human brain is a learning machine so whynot just train our robot so it you would
 build a massive machine learning into our machine and with that were able tonot just learn from human drivers we had
 the entire speed control of the vehicle was copied from human driving but alsohave the robot learn from experience
 where it made a mistake and go to recover from it and learn from it you

0:13:55
Speaker 1 :mentioned the pain point of software and
 clocks synchronization seems to seems to be aproblem that continues with robotics
 it's a tricky one with drones and so on

0:14:08
Speaker 0 :Oh what what does it take to build a


0:14:10
Speaker 1 :thing a system with so many constraints
 you have a deadline no time you're unsure about anything really it's thefirst time that people really do even
 explore yeah it's not even sure that anybody can finish when we were talkingabout the race of the desert the year
 before nobody finished what does it take to scramble and finish a product thatactually a system that actually works we


0:14:35
Speaker 0 :were very lucky we did a small team that
 core of the team of four people it was four because five couldn't comfortablysit inside carpet for food and I as a
 team leader my job was to get pizza for everybody and wash the car and stufflike this and repair the radiator and it
 broke and debug the system and we were a kind of open mind that we had like noegos involved in this you just wonder to
 see how far we can get or we did really really well was time management we weredone with everything a month before the
 race and we froze the entire of a month before the race and it turned outlooking at other teams every other team
 complained if they just one more week they would have won and we decidedthat's gonna fall into a mistake you're
 gonna be early and we had an entire month to shake that systemand we actually found two or three minor
 bugs in the last month that we had to fix and we were completely prepared inthe race occurred okay so first of all


0:15:30
Speaker 1 :that's such an incredibly rare


0:15:32
Speaker 0 :

0:15:34
Speaker 1 :achievement in terms of being able to be
 done on time or ahead of time what do you how do you do that in your futurework what advice do you have in general
 because it seems to be so rare especially in highly innovative projectslike this people work till the last


0:15:50
Speaker 0 :second but the nice thing about the
 topic one challenge is that the problem was incredibly well-defined we were ablefor a while to drive the old topic van
 challenge course which had been used the year before and then at some reason wewere kicked out of the region so we had
 to go to different desert the Sonoran Desert and be able to drive deserttrails just at the same time so there
 was never any debate about like what is actually the problem we didn't sit downand say hey should we build a car or a
 plane if we had to build a car that made it very very easy then I studied my ownlife and life of a dozen guys that the
 typical mistake that people make is that there's this kind of crazy bug left thatthey haven't found yet and and it's just
 there regretted and it back would have been trivial to fix it was haven't fixedit yet they didn't want to fall into
 that trap so I build a testing team we had a testing tena build a testingbooklet of 160 pages of tests we had to
 go through just to make sure we shake all the system appropriately Wow and thetesting team was with us all the time
 and dictated to us today we do railroad crossings tomorrow over do we practicethe start of the event and in all of
 these we thought oh my god has long solved trivial and I mean tested it outoh my god it doesn't were a well for us
 and why not oh my god it mistakes the and the rails for metal barriers we haveto fix this yes so it was easy a
 continuous focus on improving the weakest part of the system and as longas you you focus on improving the
 weakest part of the system you eventually build a really great system

0:17:22
Speaker 1 :let me just pause Allah is to me as an
 engineer is super-exciting that you were thinking like that especially at thatstage as brilliant that testing was such
 a core part of it it may be to linger on the point of leadershipI think it's one of the first times you
 were really a leader and you've led many very successful teams since then what

0:17:46
Speaker 0 :does it take to be a good leader I would
 say I'm most of all just take credit for the work of others right that's that'svery convenient than that because I
 can't do all the things myself I'm an engineer at heart so I I care aboutengineering so so I I don't know what
 the chicken in the egg is but as a kid I love computers because you could tellthem to do something and they actually
 did it it was very cool and you could like in the middle of a night wake up at1:00 in the morning and switch on your
 computer and what you told you to yesterday I would still do that wasreally cool
 unfortunately that it didn't quite work with people so you go to people and tellthem what to do and they don't do it
 mm-hm and they hate you for it or you do ittoday and then you go a day later and
 you stop doing it so you have to so then a question really became how can you putyourself in the brain of the of people
 as opposed to computers and it has the computers as super dumb then so dumb ifif people were as dumb as computers i
 wouldnt want to walk with them mmm but people are smart and people areemotional and people have pride and
 people have a spur a shion's so how can i connect to that and that's the thingwhere most of leadership just fails
 because many many engineers turn manager believe they can treat their team justthe same way I can treat your computer
 and it just doesn't work this way it's just really bad so how did how can i howare can i connect to people and in turns
 out as a college professor the wonderful thing you do all the timeis to empower other people like your job
 is to make your students look great that's all you do you're the best coachand it turns out if you do a fantastic
 job is making a students look great they actually love you and their parents loveyou and they give you all the credit for
 stuff you don't deserve since that all my students who are smarter than me allthe great stuff invented at Stanford
 versus their stuff not my stuff and they give me credit and say oh Sebastian butjust making them feel good about
 themselves so the question really is can you take a team of people and what doesit take to make them to connect to what
 they actually want in life and turn this into product affection it turns outevery human being that I know has
 incredibly good intention I've really never really met a personwith bad intentions I believe every
 person wants to contribute I think every person I've met wants to help othersit's amazing how much of a urge we have
 not to just help ourselves but to help others so how can we empower people andgive them the right framework that they
 can accomplish this if in moments when it works it's magical because you'd seethe confluence of people being able to
 make the world a better place and driving enormous confidence andpride out of this and that's when when
 my environment works the best these are moments where I can disappear for amonth and come back and things still
 work it's very hard to accomplish but in

0:20:34
Speaker 1 :when it works is amazing so I agree very
 much it's not often heard that most people in the world have good intentionsat the core their intentions are good
 and they're good people that's a beautiful message it's not often heard

0:20:49
Speaker 0 :we make this mistake and this is a
 friend of mine eggs water token us that we we judge ourselves by our intentionsin others by the actions and I think the
 the biggest skill I mean here in Silicon Valley were full of Engineers I havevery little empathy and and I kind of
 befuddled why it doesn't work for them the biggest skill I think that thatpeople should acquire is to put
 themselves into the position of the other and listen and listen to what theother has to say and they'd be shocked
 how similar they are to themselves and they might even be shocked how their ownactions don't reflect their intentions I
 often have conversations with engineers yes they look hey I love you doing agreat job and by the way what you just
 did has the following effect are you aware of that and then people would sayoh my god not I wasn't because my
 intention was that they'd say yeah I trust your intention you're a good humanbeing but just to help you in the future
 if you keep expressing it that way then people just hate you and I've had manyinstances we say oh my god thank you for
 telling me this because it wasn't my intention to look like an idiot wasn'tmy intention to help other people I just
 didn't know how to do it simply by the way there's a no-failcarnegie 1936 how to make friends and
 how to influence others has the entire pipe or just read it and you're done andusually apply it every day and I wish I
 could I was good enough to apply it every day but it says simple thingsright like be positive remember previous
 name smile and eventually have empathy like really think that the person thatyou hate and you think is an idiot is if
 you just like yourself it's a person who's struggling who means well and whomight need help and guess what you need


0:22:37
Speaker 1 :help I've recently spoken with Stephen
 Schwarzman I'm not sure if you know who that is but do so and he said I'm a list

0:22:43
Speaker 0 :

0:22:48
Speaker 1 :no but he he said sort of to expand on
 what you're saying that one of the biggest things you can do is hear peoplewhen they tell you what their problem is
 and then help them with that problem he says it's surprising how few peopleactually listen to what troubles others
 and because it's right there in front of you and you can benefit the world themost and in fact yourself and everybody
 around you by just hearing the problems

0:23:20
Speaker 0 :and solving them I mean that's my my
 little history of engineering that is while I was engineering with computers Ididn't care all what the computers
 problems for just I just volumize everyone to do it and it doesn't workwith me you've become the mean say to do
 AI do the opposite but let's return to

0:23:43
Speaker 1 :the comfortable world of engineering
 thinking you can you tell me in broad strokes in how you see it because you'rethe course starting at the core of
 driving it the technical evolution of autonomous vehicles from the first DARPAGrand Challenge to the incredible
 success we see or the program you started with Google self-driving car andway more in the entire industry that
 sprung up all the different kinds of approaches debates and so on well the

0:24:10
Speaker 0 :idea of self-driving car goes back to
 the 80s there was a team in Germany on the team at Carnegie Mellon that it'svery pioneering work but back in the day
 I'd say the computers were so efficient that even the best professors andengineers in the world basically stood
 no chance it then folded into a phase where the US government spent at leasthalf a million dollars that I could
 count on research projects but the way the procurement works a successful stackof paper describing lots of stuff that
 no one's ever gonna read was a successful product of a research projectso so we trained our researchers to
 produce lots of paper that all changed for the DARPA Grand Challenge and Ireally gotta credit the ingenious people
 at DARPA and the US government in Congress that took a complete newfunding model where they said that's not
 fun effort let's fund outcomes and it sounds way trivial but it there was notax code that allowed did the use of
 congressional tax money for a price it was all effort based so if you put in ahundred dollars in you could charge 100
 hours you put in a thousand dollars and you could build a thousand hours byshading the focus in city making the
 price we don't pay you for development we pray for the accomplishmentthey drew in they automatically drew out
 all these contractors who are used to the drug of getting money power and theydrew in a whole bunch of new people and
 these people are mostly crazy people there were people who had a car and acomputer and they wanted to make a
 million bucks the million bucks was the official price money was then doubledand they felt if I put my computer in my
 car and program it I can be rich and it was so awesome like like half the team'sthere was a team that was surfer dudes
 and they had like two surfers on the vehicle and brought like these fashiongirls super cute girls like twin sisters
 and and you could tell these guys were not your common I felt very offended wholike gets all these big multi-million
 and billion other countries from the US government and and there was a great weset the universities moved in I was very
 fortunate at Stanford that I just received tenure so I couldn't be firedwhenever I do otherwise I would have
 done it and I had enough money to finance this thing and I was able toattract a lot of money from
 from third parties and even car companies moved in they kind of moved invery quietly because they were super
 scared to be embarrassed that they a car would flip over but Ford was there andVolkswagen was there and a few others
 and GM was there so it kind of reset the entire landscape of people and if youlook at who's a big name in suffering
 cars today these were mostly people who participated in those challengesok that's incredible can you just


0:26:53
Speaker 1 :comment quickly on your sense of lessons
 learned from that kind of funding model and the research that's going onacademia in terms of producing papers is
 there something to be learned and and scaled up bigger these having thesekinds of grand challenges that could
 improve outcomes so I'm a big believer

0:27:13
Speaker 0 :in and focusing on kind of an end-to-end
 system I'm a really big believer in an insistence building I've always builtsystems in my academic career even
 though I love math and an abstract stuff but it's all derived from the idea oflet's solve your problem and it's very
 hard for me to be an academic and say let me solve a component of aproblem like if someone this feels like
 not monitoring logic or AI planning systems where people believe that acertain style of problem-solving
 is the ultimate end objective and and I would always turn it around and say heywhat problem put my grandmother care
 about that doesn't understand computer technology and doesn't want tounderstand how could I make her love
 what I do because only then do I have an impact on the worldI can easily impress my colleagues
 that's that's that that is much easier but impressing my grandmother is veryvery hard so I've always thought if I
 can build a self-driving car and and my grandmother can use it even after sheloses her driving privileges or Sheldon
 can use it or we save maybe a million lives a year they would be veryimpressive and then there's so many
 problems like these like there's a problem of curing cancer or I'll iftwice as long once the problem is
 defined of course I can solve it in society like it takes sometimes tens ofthousands of people to to find a
 solution there's no way you can fund an army of ten thousand at Stanford soyou're going to be the prototype it's
 bit of meaningful prototype and the DARPA Grand Challenge wasbeautiful because it told me what this
 prototype had to do I didn't need to think about what it had to do it is saidto read the rules and it was really
 really beautiful and it's most beautiful

0:28:50
Speaker 1 :you think what academia could aspire to
 is to build a prototype that's the system's level that solves it gives youan inkling that this problem could be
 solved with this project that's all I

0:29:03
Speaker 0 :want to emphasize what academia really
 is and I think people misunderstand it first and foremost academia is a way toeducate young people first and foremost
 the professor is an educator no matter away what a small suburban college orwhether you are a Harvard or Stanford
 professor that's not the way most people think of themselves in academia becausewe have this kind of competition going
 on for citations and and publication that's a measurable thing but that issecondary to the primary purpose of
 educating people to think now in terms of research most of the great sciencethe great research comes out of
 universities you can trace almost everything back including Google touniversities so there's nothing we do
 fundamentally broken here it's a it's a good system and I think America has thefinest University system on the planet
 we can talk about reach and how to reach people outside the system it's adifferent topic but the system would
 serve as a good system if I had one wish I would say it'd be really great ifthere was more debate about what the
 great big problems are on the side and focus on those and most of them areinterdisciplinary unfortunately it's
 very easy to fall into a inner disciplinary viewpoint where yourproblem is dictators but what your
 closest colleagues believe the problem is it's very hard to break out and saywhy there's an entire new field of
 problems so give an example um prior to me working on self-driving cars I was aroboticist in a machine learning expert
 and I wrote books on robotics something called probabilistic robotics the surveymethods driven kind of viewpoint of the
 world I build robots that acted in museums as tour guides that bug letchildren around it's something that it's
 time was moderately challenging when I started working on cars severalcolleagues told me Sebastian you're
 destroying your career because in our field of robotics cars are looked likeas a gimmick and they're not expressive
 enough they can only push the throttle and and in the brakes there's nodexterity there's no complexity it's
 just too simple and no one came to me and said Wow if you solve that problemyou can save a million lives right
 among all robotic problems that I've seen in my life I would say the selfhaving car transportation Havana has the
 most hope for society so how come the robotics community was all over theplace and of us become because we
 focused on methods and solutions and not on problems like if you go around todayand ask your grandmother what bugs you
 what really makes you upset I challenge any academic and to do thisand then realize how far your research
 is probably away from that today at the

0:31:55
Speaker 1 :very least that's a good thing for
 academics they deliberate on the other

0:31:58
Speaker 0 :thing that's really nice in Silicon
 Valley is Silicon Valley is full of smart people outside academia right sothere's the Larry page's and magaz
 archive books in the world who are anywhere as smart or smarter than thebest academics I met in my life and what
 they do is they they are at a different level they build the systems they buildthey build the customer-facing system
 they built things that people can use without technical education and they areinspired by research they're inspired by
 scientist they hire the best PhDs from the best universities for a reason so Ithink this kind of vertical integration
 that between the real product the real impact and the real thought the realideas there's actually working
 surprisingly balanced Silicon Valley it did not work as well in other places inthis nation so when I worked at Carnegie
 Mellon we had the world's finest computer science university but therewasn't those people in Pittsburgh that
 would be able to take these very fine computer science ideas and turn theminto massive the impact for products
 that symbiosis seemed to exist pretty much only in Silicon Valley and maybe abit in Boston in Austin yeah with


0:33:07
Speaker 1 :Stanford that's it was it's really
 really interesting so if we look a little bit further onfrom the the DARPA Grand Challenge and
 the launch of the Google self-driving car what do you see is the state thechallenges of autonomous vehicles as
 they are now is actually achieving that huge scale and having a huge impact on

0:33:30
Speaker 0 :society I'm extremely proud of what what
 has been accomplished and again I'm taking a lot of credit for the work forus and I'm actually very optimistic and
 and people have been kind of worrying is it too fast as to slow I salute thereyet and so on it is actually quite an
 interesting hard problem and in that a self-driving car to build one thatmanages 90% of the problems encountered
 in everyday driving is easy we can literally do this over a weekend to do99% might take a month then there's 1%
 left so 1% would mean that you still have a fatal accident every week veryunacceptable so now you work on this 1%
 and the 99% of there were any 1% is actually still a relatively easy but nowyou're down to like a hundredth of one
 percent and it's still completely unacceptable in terms of safety so thevariety of things you encounter are just
 enormous and that gives me enormous respect for human being available todeal with the couch on the highway right
 or the DNI headlight or the blown tire that we'd never never been trained forand all of a sudden I have to handle in
 an emergency situation and often do very very successfully it's amazingfrom that perspective how safe driving
 actually is given how many millions of miles we drive every year in thiscountry we are now at a point where I
 believed it in already is there and I've seen it I've seen it in way more I'veseen it in activist engine crews and in
 a number of companies in unvoyage where vehicles not driving around andbasically flawlessly I able to drive
 people around in limited scenarios in fact you can go to Vegas today and ordera Seminole lift and if you got the right
 setting off your app you'll be picked up by a driverless car now there's stillsafety drivers in there but that's a
 fantastic way to kind of learn what the limits of Technology today and there'sstill some glitches
 but the gifts have become very very rare I think the next step is gonna be todown cost it to harden it did that
 entrapment it sends us are not quite an automatic weights than that yet and thenyou read about the business models to
 really kind of go somewhere and make the business case and the business case ishard work it's not just oh my god we
 have this capability people that's gonna buy it you have to make it affordableyou have to give people that find the
 social acceptance of people none of the teams yet has been able to or gutsyenough to drive around without a person
 inside the car and that's that the next magical hurdle will be able to sendthese vehicles around completely empty
 in traffic and I think I'm gonna wait everyday wait for the news that vamo hasjust done this so you know the


0:36:12
Speaker 1 :interesting you mentioned gutsy I mean
 let me ask some maybe unanswerable question may be edgy questions but interms of how much risk is required some
 guts in terms of leadership style it would be good to contrast approaches andI don't think anyone knows what's right
 but if we compare Tesla and way mo for example Elon Musk and the way mo teamthe there's slight differences in
 approach so on the Elon side there's more I don't know what the right word touse but aggression in terms of
 innovation and I'm way mo side there's more sort of cautious safety focusedapproach to the problem what do you
 think it takes what leadership at which moment is right which approach is right

0:37:10
Speaker 0 :look I'm I don't sit in either of those
 teams so I'm unable to even verify like somebody says correct right in the endof the day every innovator in in that
 space will face a fundamental dilemma and I would say you could put aerospaceTitans into the same bucket yes which is
 you have to balance public safety with your drive to innovate and this countryin particular in states has a
 plus your history of doing this very successfully yet travel is what ahundred times are safe per mile than
 ground travel and then cars and there's a reason for it because people havefound ways to be very methodological
 about ensuring public safety while still being able to make progress on importantaspects for example like yell and noise
 and fuel consumption so I think that those practices are pruned and theyactually work we live in a world safer
 than ever before and yes they will always be the provision that somethingwas wrong there's always the possibility
 that someone makes a mistake or there's an unexpected failure we can't neverguarantee to 100 percent absolute safety
 other than just not doing it but I think I'm very proud of thehistory of of United States I mean we've
 we've dealt with much more dangerous technology like nuclear energy and keptthat safe too we have nuclear weapons
 and we keep those safe so so we have methods and procedures that reallybalance these two things very very
 successfully you've mentioned a lot of

0:38:43
Speaker 1 :great autonomous vehicle companies that
 are taking sort of the level 4 level file they jump in full autonomy or thesafety driver and take that kind of
 approach and also through simulation and so on there's also the approach thatTesla autopilot is doing which is kind
 of incrementally taking a level 2 vehicle and using machine learning andlearning from the driving of human
 beings and trying to creep up trying to incremental improve the system untilit's able to achieve level 4 autonomy so
 perfect autonomy in certain kind of geographical regions what are yourthoughts on these contrasting approaches


0:39:23
Speaker 0 :when suppose of all I I'm a very proud
 Tesla and I literally used the autopilot every day and it literally has kept mesafe is a beautiful technology
 specifically for highway driving when I'm slightly tired because then it turnsme into a much safer driver and that I'm
 a hundred percent confident it's the caseand tells us the right approach I think
 that the biggest change I've seen since I went away one team is is this thingcalled deep learning deep learning was
 was not a hot topic when I when I started way more or Google sufferingcars it was there in fact we saw the
 Google brain at the same time in Google X so I invested in deep learning butpeople didn't talk about it wasn't a hot
 topic and nowadays there's a shift of emphasis from a more geometricperspective where you use geometric
 sensors they give you a full 3d view when you do a geometric reasoning aboutall of this box over here might be a car
 towards a more human like oh let's just learn about it this looks like the thingI've seen 10,000 times before so maybe
 it's the same thing machine learning perspective and thathas really put I think all these
 approaches on steroids at Udacity we teach a course in self-driving cars wecan in fact I think we'd be if credit is
 over 20,000 or so people on self-driving car skills so every every self-drivingcar team in the world now uses our
 engineers and in this course the very first homework assignment is to do Lanefinding on images and lane finding
 images for layman what this means is you you put a camera into your car or youopen your eyes and even know where the
 lane is right so so you can stay inside the lane with your car humans can dothis super easily you just look and you
 know where the line is just intuitively for machines for long term of a superheart because people would write these
 kind of crazy rules if there's like vineland marcus and he's for fightreally means this is not quite wide
 enough so let's all it's not right or maybe the Sun is trying so when the Sunshines and this is right and this is a
 straight line I missed quite a straight line because the ball is curved and anddo we know that there's really six feet
 between lane markings or not or 12 feet whatever it is and now the very studentsare doing they would take machine
 learning so instead of like writing these crazy rules for the lane marker isthey say let's take an hour driving and
 label it and tell the vehicle this is actually the lane by hand and then theseare examples and have the Machine find
 its own rules but for lane markings are and within 24 hours now every studentthere's never done any programming for
 in this space can write a perfect Lane finder as good as the best commercialline
 and that's completely amazing to me we've seen progress using machinelearning that completely Dwarfs anything
 that I saw ten years ago yeah and just

0:42:11
Speaker 1 :as a side note the self-driving car
 nanodegree the fact that you launch that many years ago now maybe four years agothree years ago three years ago is
 incredible that it that's a great example of system level thinking sort ofjust taking an entire course I teach
 each other solve entire problem I definitely recommend people it's been

0:42:31
Speaker 0 :super popular and it's become actually
 incredibly high quality we build it with Mercedes and and and various othercompanies in that space and we find that
 engineers from Tesla and vamo are taking it todaythe insight was that two things one is
 existing universities will be very slow to move because the departmental ice andthere's no department for self-driving
 cars so between Mickey and EE and computer science getting these folkstogether into one room is really really
 hard and every professor listening he ever know that probably agree to thatand secondly even if if all the great
 universities just did this which none so far has develop a curriculum in thisfield it is just a few thousand students
 they can partake because all the great universities are super selective so howabout people in India how about people
 in China or in the Middle East or Indonesia or Africa right should thosebe excluded from the skill of building
 self-driving cars are there any dumber than we are any less privileged and theanswer is we should just give everybody
 the skill to build a self-driving car because if we do this then we have likea thousand self-driving car startups and
 if 10 percent succeed that's like a hundred that means hundred countries nowwe have self-driving cars and be safer
 it's kind of interesting to imagine

0:43:47
Speaker 1 :impossible to qualify but the number the
 you know over a period of several decades the impact that has like asingle course like a ripple effect of
 society if you just recently thought the Android and who was creator of cosmosshow it's interesting to think about how
 many scientists that show launched yes and so it's reallyin terms of impact I can't imagine a
 better course than the self-driving car course that's you know the there's othermore specific disciplines like deep
 learning and so on that Udacity is also teaching but self-driving cars it'sreally really interesting course yeah


0:44:26
Speaker 0 :and it came at the right moment it came
 at a time when there were a bunch of aqua huggers aqua hire as a acquisitionof a company not for its technology or
 its products or business but for its peopleso aqua hire means maybe the company of
 70 people they have no product yet but they're super smart people and he payscertain amount of money so I took back
 the highest like GM Cruise and uber and and others and did the math and said heyhow many people are there and how much
 money was paid and as a lower bound is tomato value of an self-driving carengineer in these acquisitions to be at
 least 10 million dollars right so think about this you you get just have a skilland you team up and build a company and
 you're worth now is 10 million dollars I mean it's kind of cool I mean but whatother thing could you do in life to be
 worth 10 million dollars within a year

0:45:16
Speaker 1 :yeah amazing but to come back for a
 moment on to deep learning and its application in autonomous vehicles youknow what are your thoughts on Elon
 Musk's statement provocative statement perhaps that lighter is a crutch so thisgeometric way of thinking about the
 world maybe holding us back if what we should instead be doing in this roboticsbut in this particular space of
 autonomous vehicles is using camera as a primary sensor and using computer visionor machine learning is the primary way


0:45:49
Speaker 0 :to look up to Commons I think first of
 all we all know that people can drive cars without light us in their handsbecause we only have eyes and we most
 you just use eyes for driving maybe we use some other perception about ourbodies accelerations occasionally our
 years certainly not our noses so that the existence proof is there that eyesmust be sufficient in fact we could even
 drive a car someone put a camera out and then give us the camera image with knownagency you would be able to drive a car
 and that way it the same way so cameras sufficient secondly I really love theidea that in in the Western world we
 have many many different people trying different hypotheses it's almost like ananthill like if another Idol tries to
 forage for food but you can sit there as two ands and agree what the perfect pathis and then every single ant marches for
 the most like the location of food is or you can even just spread out and Ipromise you the spread out solution will
 be better because if the discussing philosophical intellectual ends get itwrong and they're all moving the wrong
 direction they're gonna waste a day and then you're gonna discuss again foranother week
 whereas if all these ants go in a random direction someone's gonna succeed andyou're gonna come back and claim victory
 and get the Nobel Prize about everything antipholus and then they'll march in thesame direction and that's great about
 society that's great about the Western society if you're not plant-based you'renot central base we don't have a Soviet
 Union style central government that tells us where to forge we just Forge westart and seek or you get investor money
 and go out and try it out and who knows

0:47:28
Speaker 1 :is gonna win I like it in your when you
 look at the long term vision of autonomous vehiclesdo you see machine learning as
 fundamentally being able to solve most of the problems so learning fromexperience I'd say we should be very


0:47:42
Speaker 0 :clear about what machine learning is and
 is not and I think there's a lot of confusion for this today is a technologythat can go through large databases of
 repetitive patterns and find those patterns so in example we did a study atstand for two years ago where we applied
 machine learning to detecting skin cancer and images and we harvested orbuilt a data set of 129,000 skin photo
 shots that were all had been biopsied for what the actual situation was andthose included melanomas and carcinomas
 also included rashes and other skin conditions lesions and then we had anetwork find those patterns and it was
 by and large able to then detect skin cancer with an iPhone as accurately asthe best board-certified Stanford level
 dermatologist we proved that now not this thing wasgreat in this one thing I'm finding skin
 cancer but it couldn't drive a car so so the difference to human intelligence aswe do all these many many things and we
 can often learn from a very small data set of experiences but as machines stillneed very large data sets and things
 should be very repetitive no that's still super impactful because almosteverything we do is repetitive so that's
 gonna we transform human labor but it's not this almighty general intelligencewe're really far away from a system that
 will exhibit general intelligence to that end I actually commiserate thenaming a little bit because artificial
 intelligence if you believe Hollywood is immediately mixed into the idea of humansuppression and and machine superiority
 I don't think that we don't see this in my lifetime I don't think humansuppression is a good idea I don't see
 it coming I don't see the technology being there what I see instead is a verypointed focused pattern recognition
 technology that's able to extract patterns relation large data sets and indoing so it can be super impactful and
 super impactful let's take the impact of artificial terrorism on human work weall know that it takes something like
 10,000 hours to become an expert if you're gonna be a doctor or lawyer oreven a really good driver it takes a
 certain amount of time to become experts machines now are able and have beenshown to observe people become experts
 in observe experts and then extract those rules from experts in someinteresting way they could go from law
 to sales to driving cars to diagnosing cancer and then giving that capabilityto people who are completely new in
 their job we now can and that's that's been done has been done commercially inmany many instances that means we can
 use machine learning to make people an expert on the very first day of theirwork like think about the impact if if
 your doctor is still in the first 10,000 hours you have a doctor who's not quitean expert yet
 who would not want the doctor who is the world's best expert and now we canleverage machines to really eradicate
 the error and decision making error and lack of expertise for human doctors theycould save your life
 if we can link on that for a little bit

0:51:08
Speaker 1 :in which way do you hope machines in the
 medical in the medical field could help assist doctors you mentioned this sortof accelerating the learning curve or
 people if they start a job or in the first 10,000 hours can be assisted by amachine how do you how do you envision
 that assistance looking so we built this

0:51:30
Speaker 0 :this app for an iPhone that can detect
 and classify and diagnose skin cancer and we proved two years ago there is aspretty much as good or better than the
 best human doctor so let me give his story so there's a friend of mine iscalling Ben Ben is a very famous venture
 capitalist he goes to his doctor and the doctor looks at a mall and and says heythat mole is probably harmless and for
 some very funny reason he pulls out that phone with our app he's a collaboratorin our study and the app says no no no
 this is a melanoma and and for background melanomas are skin cancersthe most common cancer in this country
 melanomas can go from from stage zero to Stage four within less than a year stagezero means you can basically cut it all
 yourself with better kitchen knife and be safe and Stage four means yourchances of leading from five more years
 in less than 20% so it's a very serious serious serious condition so this doctorwho took out the iPhone looked at the
 iPhone was a little bit puzzled Samina but just to be safe let's cut it out andbiopsy it that's that the technical term
 for let's get an in-depth diagnostics that is more than just looking at it andit came back as cancerous as a melanoma
 and it was then removed and my friend Ben I was hiking with him and we aretalking about a I in and said I turn
 into this vote on skin cancer he's so funny my doctor just had an iPhone thatfound my cancer so I was a completely in
 tree didn't even know about so here's a person I mean this is a realhuman life right now who doesn't know
 somebody who's been affected by cancer cancer is cause of death number twocancer is this kind of disease that that
 is mean in in the following way most cancers can actually be cured relativelyeasily if we catch them early and and
 the reason why we don't tend to catch them early is because they have nosymptoms like your very first symptom of
 a gallbladder cancer or a pancreatic cancer might be a headache and when youfinally go to your doctor because of
 these headaches or your back pain and you're being imaged it's usually stagefour plus and that's the time when the
 your curing chances might be dropped to a single-digit percentage so if we couldleverage the eye to inspect your body on
 a regular basis without even a doctor in the room maybe when you take a showerover have you I know this sounds creepy
 but then we might be able to save millions and millions of lives

0:54:06
Speaker 1 :you've mentioned there's a concern that
 people have about near-term impacts of AI in terms of job loss so you'vementioned being able to assist doctors
 being able to assist people in their jobs do you have a worry of peoplelosing their jobs or the economy being
 affected by the improvements in AI

0:54:26
Speaker 0 :anybody concern about job losses please
 come to get a sitcom we teach contemporary tech skills and wehave a kind of implicit job promise we
 often when when we measure we spend way over 50% of our graders in new jobsthey're very satisfied about it and it
 costs almost nothing cost like a thousand five hundred max or somethinglike that and so there's a cool new


0:54:48
Speaker 1 :program they agree with the US
 government guaranteeing that you will help us give scholarships that educatepeople and in this kind of situation


0:54:58
Speaker 0 :you're working with the US government on
 the idea of basically building the American dream so Udacity has justdedicated one hundred thousand
 scholarships for citizens of America for various levels of courses thateventually will get you a job and those
 courses all somewhat relate with the tech sector because the tech sector iskind of the hottest sector right now and
 they range from in two level digital marketing to very advanced self drivingcar engineering and we're doing this
 with the white house because II think is bipartisan it's an issue that is that ifyou want to really make America great
 being able to be a part of the solution and live the American dream requires usto be proactive about our education and
 our skill set it's just the way it is today and it's always been this way I'vealways had this American dream to send
 our kids to college and now the American dream has to be to send ourselves tocollege into this very vey vey
 efficiently and very way we can squeeze in and evenings and things to online orat all ages all ages so our our learners
 go from age 11 to age 80 I just travel Germany and and the guy in traincompartment next to me was my students
 wow that's amazing I don't think aboutimpact we've become the educator of
 choice for now I believe officially six countries or five countries is most inthe Middle East like Saudi Arabia and in
 Egypt in Egypt we just had a cohort graduate um where we had 1100 highschool students that went through
 programming skills proficient at the level of computer science undergrad andwe had a 95% graduation rate even though
 everything's online it's kind of tough but we kind of trying to figure out howto make this effective the vision is the
 vision is very very simple the vision is education ought to be abasic human right it cannot be locked up
 behind ivory tower walls only for the rich people for the parents who might bebright themself into the system and only
 for young people and only for people from the right demographics literategeography and possibly even the right
 race it has to be opened up to everybody if we if we are truthful to the humanmission via truthful to our values we
 gonna open up education to everybody in the worldso Udacity is pledge of a hundred
 thousand scholarships I think it's the biggest pleasure of scholarships ever interms of the numbers and we've working
 as I said for the White House and with very accomplished CEOs like Tim Cookfrom Apple and others to really bring
 education to everywhere in the world not

0:57:41
Speaker 1 :to ask if you pick the favorite of your


0:57:45
Speaker 0 :children but at this podium Jasper no
 okay good in this particular moment

0:57:52
Speaker 1 :what nanodegree what said of course is
 are you most excited about Udacity or is that too impossible to pick I've been

0:58:02
Speaker 0 :super excited about something we haven't
 launched yet in the building which is when we talk to our partner companies wehave known a very strong footing in the
 enterprise world and also to our students we've kind of always focused onthese hard skills like the programming
 skills or math skills or building skills or design skills and a very common taskis soft skills like how do you behave in
 your work how you develop empathy how do you work in a team what are the verybasics of management how do you do time
 management how do you advance your career in thecontext of a broader community and
 that's something that we haven't done very valid audacity and I would say mostuniversities doing very poorly as well
 because we're so obsessed with individual test scores and and so littlepace a little attention to teamwork in
 education so that's something I see us moving into as a company because I'mexcited about this and I think look we
 can teach people tech skills and they're going to be great but if you teachpeople empathy that's gonna have the
 same impact may be harder than

0:59:06
Speaker 1 :self-driving cars but I don't think so I


0:59:08
Speaker 0 :think the rules are really simple you
 just have to you have to you have to want to engage it's it's via weliterally went in in school and in k-12
 we teach kids like get the highest math score and if you are a rational humanbeing you might evolved from this
 education say having the best math score and the best English scores make me thebest leader and it turns out not to be
 the case it's actually really wrong becausemaking first of all in terms of math
 scores I think is perfectly fine to hire somebody with great math skills you'dhave to do yourself you can't hire some
 of the good empathy for you that's much harder but it can always hire some withgreat math skills but we live in in
 affluent world where we constantly deal with other people and it's a beauty it'snot a nuisance it's a beauty so if we
 somehow develop that muscle that we can do that well and empower others in theworkplace I think you're gonna be super
 successful and I know many fellow

1:00:04
Speaker 1 :roboticists and computer scientists that
 I will assist take this course not to be

1:00:10
Speaker 0 :

1:00:13
Speaker 1 :named many many years ago 1903 the
 Wright brothers flew in Kitty Hawk for the first time and you've watched acompany of the same name Kitty Hawk with
 the dream of building flying cars evey tall's so at the big picture what arethe big challenges of making this thing
 that actually inspired generations of people about what the future looks likewhat does it take one of the biggest


1:00:43
Speaker 0 :challenges so so flying cars has always
 been a dream of boy every girl wants to fly let's behonest yes and let's go back in on
 history of you're dreaming of flying I think my answer my single mostremembered childhood dream has been a
 dream where I was sitting on a pillow and I could fly I was like five yearsold I remember like maybe three dreams
 are much higher but that's the one that we remember most vividly and then PeterThiel famously said they promise us
 flying cars and they give us 140 characters pointing as Twitter at thetime limiting message size 240
 characters so if you're coming back now to really go for this super impactfulstuff like flying cars and to be precise
 they're not really cars they don't have wheelsthey actually much closer to a
 helicopter than anything else they take off vertically in the fly horizontallybut they have important differences one
 difference is that they are much quieter if you just released a vehicle calledproject heavy side they can fly over you
 as low as a helicopter and you basically can't hear it's like 38 decibels it'slike like that if you were inside a
 library you might be able to hear it but anywhere outdoors your ambient noise ishigher secondly they're they're much
 more affordable they're much more affordable than helicopters and thereason is helicopters are expensive for
 many reasons there's lots of single point of figures in a helicopter there'sa bolt between the blades
 that's cause Jesus fault and the reason why it's called Jesus board is it thatif this boat breaks you will die there
 is no second solution in helicopter flight whereas we have these distributedmechanism when you go from gasoline to
 electric you can now have many many many small motors as opposed to one big motorand that means if you lose one of those
 motors not a big deal heavy side if it loses a motor has eightof those you lose one of those eight
 motors so it's seven left you can take off just like before and land just likebefore we are now also moving into a
 technology it doesn't require a commercial pilot because in some levelflight is actually easier than than
 ground transportation like in self-driving cars oh the world is fullof like children and bicycles and other
 cars and mailboxes and curbs and shrubs and what-have-you all these things youhave to avoid when you go above
 buildings and tree lines there's nothing there I mean you can do the test rightnow look outside and count the number of
 things you see flying I'd be shocked if you could see more than two things it'sprobably just zero in the Bay Area the
 most I've ever seen was six and maybe it's 15 or 20 but not ten thousand sothe sky is very ample and very empty and
 very free so the vision is can be built a socially acceptable mass transittransit solution for daily
 transportation that is affordable and we have an existence proof Heaviside canfly a hundred miles in range with still
 30% electric reserves it can fly up to like a hundred and eighty miles an hourwe know that that solution that scale
 would make your ground transportation 10 times as fast as a car based on usecensus data which means we would take
 your 300 hours of day of yearly commute down to 30 hours and giving 270 hoursback who wouldn't want I mean who
 doesn't hate traffic like I hate give me the person thatdoesn't hate traffic I hate traffic
 every day every time I want traffic I hate itand and if we could free the world from
 traffic we have technology we can free the world from traffic yeah we have thetechnology it's there we have an
 existence proof test it's not a technological problem anymore do you

1:04:26
Speaker 1 :think there is a future where tens of
 thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of both delivery drones and flying cars ofthis kind a VTOL fill the sky i


1:04:39
Speaker 0 :absolutely believe this and there's
 obviously the societal acceptance is a major question and of course safety as Ibelieve in and safety of you exceed
 ground transportation safety as has happened for aviation already commercialaviation and in terms of acceptance I
 think one of the key things is noise that's why we are focusing relentlesslyon noise and we bid perhaps the crisis
 electric VTOL vehicle ever built the nice thing about the sky isthree-dimensional so so any
 mathematician will immediately recognize the difference between 1d of a lack ofregular highway to
 three of a sky but to make it clear for the layman say you want to make ahundred vertical lanes of highway 101 in
 San Francisco because you believe building a health and vertical lanes isthe right solution imagine how much it
 would cost to stack a hundred vertical lanes physically onto 101 there would beprohibitive that would be consuming the
 world's GDP for an entire year just for one highwayit's amazing expensive again in the sky
 it would just be a recompilation of a piece of software because all theselanes are virtual that means any vehicle
 that is in conflict with another vehicle would just go to different altitudes andthen the conflict is gone and if you
 don't believe this that's exactly how how commercial aviation works when youfly from New York to San Francisco
 another plane flies from Sanford to New York there are different altitudes sothey don't hit each other it's a soft
 problem for the jet space and it will be a soft problem for the urban spacethere's companies like Google Bing and
 Amazon working on very innovative solutions how do a space management useexactly the same principles as we use
 today throughout today's dance there's nothing hard about this do you envision

1:06:27
Speaker 1 :autonomy being a key part of it so that
 that the flying vehicles are either semi autonomous or fully autonomous a hundred

1:06:37
Speaker 0 :percent autonomous you don't want idiots
 like me flying in the sky I promise you and if you have ten thousand what's themovie The Fifth Element to get a thief
 over to happen if it's not autonomous in a centralized that's a really

1:06:50
Speaker 1 :interesting idea of a centralized sort
 of management system for lanes and so on so actually just being able to havesimilar as we have in the current
 commercial aviation but scale it up to which much more vehicles a reallyinteresting optimization problem it is


1:07:08
Speaker 0 :vey mathematically very very
 straightforward like the gap we leave between jets is Gargantuas and part ofthe reason is there isn't that many
 gents so this feels like a good solution today when you get vectored by a trafficcontrol someone talks to you right so
 any ATC controller might have up to maybe 20 planes on the same frequencyand then
 talk to you have to talk back and it feels right because there isn't morethan 20 pins around any hours so you can
 talk to everybody but if there's 20,000 things around he can't talk to everybodyanymore so we have to do something
 that's called digital like text messaging like we do have solutions likewe have about four or five billion
 smartphones in the world now all right and they all connected and some of yousolved the scale problem for smart
 phones we know where they all are they can talk to somebody and they're veryreliable they amazingly reliable we
 could use the same system the same scale for air traffic control so instead of meas a pilot talking to a human being and
 in the middle of the conversation receiving a new frequency like howancient is that we could digitize the
 stuff and and digitally transmitted the right flight coordinates and thatsolution will automatic a laugh to
 10,000 vehicles we talked about empathy

1:08:21
Speaker 1 :a little bit do you think we'll one day
 build an air a eye system that a human being can love and that loves that humanback like in the movie her look I'm I'm


1:08:32
Speaker 0 :a pragmatist for me a is a is a tool
 it's like a shovel and the ethics of using the shovel I always with us thepeople and and there has to be this way
 in terms of emotions I would hate to come into my kitchen and see that myrefrigerator spoiled all my food then
 have it explained to me that it fell in love with a dishwasher and I wasn't asnice the dishwasher so as a result it
 neglected me there would just be a bad experience and it would be a bad productI would probably not recommend this for
 frigerator to my friends and that's where I draw the line I think to metechnology has to be reliable it has to
 be predictable I want my car to work I don't want to fall in love with my car Ijust wanted to work I wanted to
 compliment me not to replace me I have very unique human properties andI want the machines to make me turn me
 into a superhuman like I'm already a superhuman today thanks to the machinesthat surround me and give you examples
 I can run across the Atlantic at near the speed of sound at 36,000 feet todaythat's kind of amazing I can my voice
 now carries me all the way to Australia using a smartphone today and it's notnot the speed of sound which would take
 hours it's the speed of light my voice travels at the speed of light how coolis that that makes me superhuman I would
 even argue my my flushing toilet makes me superhuman just think of the timebefore flushing toilets and and maybe
 you have a veiled person in your family that you can ask about this or take atrip to rural India until experience it
 it's it's it makes me superhuman so to me what technology does it complementsme it makes me stronger
 therefore words like love and compassion have very little a very little interestin this for machines
 I have interested men people you don't

1:10:41
Speaker 1 :think first of all beautifully put
 beautifully argued but do you think love has use in our tools compassion

1:10:51
Speaker 0 :I think laughs is a beautiful human
 concept and if you think what love really is love is a means to conveysafety to convey trust I think Trust has
 a huge need in technology as well much as people we want to trust ourtechnology the same way we - or in
 similar way we trust people in in human interaction standards have emerged andand feelings emotions have emerged may
 be genetically may be very largely that I able to convey sense of trust sense ofsafety sense of passion of love of
 dedication that that makes the human fabric and I'm a big slacker for love Iwant to be laughter I want to be trusted
 ever me admired all these wonderful things and because all of us who we havethis beautiful system I wouldn't just
 blindly copy this to the machines here's why when you look at say transportationyou could have observed that up to the
 end of the 19th century so transportation used any number oflegs from one leg to two legs to a
 thousand legs and you could have concluded that is the right way to moveabout the environment we've been made
 exceptional birds who is flapping wings in fact there are many people inaviation that flap wings to the arms and
 jump from Cliffs most of them didn't survive then then the interesting thingis that the technology solutions are
 very different like in technologies really easily by the wheel in biology issuper hard ability there's very few
 perpetually rotating things in in in biology and everyone sells things in inengineering we can build wheels and
 those wheels gave rise to cars similar wheels gave rides to to aviation likethere's no thing there flies there
 wouldn't have something rotates like a jet engine or helicopter blades so thesolutions have used very different
 physical laws in nature and that's great so for me to be too much focused on ohthis is how nature does it this is
 replicated if we really believed that the solution to the irish revolution wasa humanoid robot it would still be
 waiting today again beautifully put

1:13:12
Speaker 1 :you said that you don't take yourself
 too seriously you just say that i mean

1:13:17
Speaker 0 :you want you to say that maybe you don't
 take me seriously I'm not yeah you're right I don't wanna I just made that upbut you know you have a humor and a


1:13:27
Speaker 1 :lightness about life that I think is it
 is beautiful and inspiring to a lot of people where does that come from thesmile the humor the lightness amidst all
 the chaos of the hard work that you and where does that come from I just love my

1:13:44
Speaker 0 :life I love I love the people around me
 I love I'm just so glad to be alive like I'm about 52 how to believe people say5251 so now feel better but in in in in
 in looking around the world looking just go back 200 300 years like Humanity iswhat 300 thousand years old
 but for the first 300,000 years - the last 100 our life expectancy would havebeen plus or minus 30 years roughly give
 or take so I would be long dead now like that makes me just enjoy every singleday of my life because I don't deserve
 this like why am i porn today when so many of my interest has died of horribledeaths like famines massive wars that
 ravaged Europe for the last 1000 years mostly disappeared after World War 2when the Americans and the Allies did
 something amazing to my country that didn't deserve itmy country of Germany it was so amazing
 and then when you when you're live and feel this every day then it is soamazing
 what what we can accomplish what we can do we live in the world that is soincredibly vastly changing every day
 almost everything that we cherish from your smartphone to your flushing toiletto all these basic inventions your new
 clothes you're wearing your watch your plain penicillin and no anesthesia forsurgery penicillin have been invented in
 the last 150 years so in the last 150 years something magical happened and Iwould trace it back to Gutenberg and the
 printing press that has been able to disseminate information more efficientlythan before that all of a sudden they're
 able to invent agriculture and nitrogen fertilization that made agriculture somuch more potent that we didn't if you
 focus of hams anymore and you could start reading and writing and we couldbecome all these wonderful things we are
 today for me LM pilot - massage therapist - software engineer this isamazing like living in that time is such
 a blessing we should sometimes really think aboutthis Steven Pinker who as a very famous
 author and philosopher whom I really adore wrote a great book calledenlightenment now and that's maybe the
 one book I would recommend and he asked the question if there was only a singlearticle written in the 20th century
 don't leave an article but would it be what's the most important innovation themost important thing that
 and he would say this article would credit a guy named Carl Bosch and Ichallenge anybody have you ever heard of
 the name Carl Bosch I hadn't okay there's a there's a Bosch corporation inGermany but it's not associated with
 Carl Bosch so I looked it up kibosh invented nitrogen fertilizationand in doing so together with an older
 invention of irrigation was able to increase the yield Ferrari cultural landby a factor of twenty six so a two
 thousand five hundred percent increase in infertility of land and that so StevePinker argues saved over two billion
 lives today two billion people who would be dead if this man hadn't done what hehad done okay think about that impact
 and what that means to society that's that's the way I look at the worldI mean it's so amazing to be a life and
 be part of this and I'm so glad I lived after Cobb abortion not before I don'tthink there's a better way to end it
