Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 Elon Musk part two the second time we spoke in the podcast with parallels if

0:00:07
Speaker 1 :

0:00:08
Speaker 0 :not in quality then an outfit to the
 objectively speaking great a sequel of all-time Godfather Part two as manypeople know Elon Musk is a leader of
 Tesla SpaceX your link and the boring company well maybe less known is thathe's a world-class engineer and designer
 constantly emphasizing first principles thinking in taking on big engineeringproblems that many before him will
 consider impossible as scientists and engineers most of us don't question the

0:00:40
Speaker 1 :

0:00:41
Speaker 0 :way things are done we simply follow the
 momentum of the crowd of revolutionary ideas that change the world on the smalland large scales happen when you return
 to the fundamentals and ask is there a better way this conversation focuses onthe incredible engineering and
 innovation done in brain computer interfaces and neural link this workpromises to help treat neurobiological
 diseases to help us further understand the connection between the individualneuron to the high-level function of the
 human brain and finally to one day expand the capacity of the brain throughtwo-way communication with computational
 devices the internet and artificial intelligence systems this is theartificial intelligence podcast if you

Speaker 1 :an anonymous youtube commenter refer to


0:01:43
Speaker 0 :our previous conversation as the quote
 historical first video of two robots conversing without supervision here'sthe second time the second conversation
 with Elon Musk

0:01:57
Speaker 1 :let's start with an easy question about
 consciousness in your view is consciousness something that's unique tohumans there's is something that
 permeates all matter almost like a fundamental force of physics

0:02:09
Speaker 0 :I don't think consciousness permeates


0:02:12
Speaker 1 :all matter pants I just believe that
 yeah there's a philosophical how would

0:02:16
Speaker 0 :you tell that's true that's a good point
 I believe in scientific message don't blow your mind anything but thescientific method it's like you can't
 test the hypothesis then you cannot reach meaningful conclusion that it is

0:02:29
Speaker 1 :true do you think consciousness
 understanding consciousness is within the reach of science of the scientific

0:02:37
Speaker 0 :method we can dramatically improve our
 understanding of consciousness you know hard pressed to say that we understandanything with complete accuracy but can
 we dramatically improve ours that any consciousness I believe the answer is

0:02:52
Speaker 1 :yes this Nai system in your view I have
 to have consciousness in order to achieve human-level or superhuman levelintelligence does it need to have some
 of these human qualities that consciousness may be a body may be afear of mortality capacity love those


0:03:12
Speaker 0 :kinds of silly human things it's
 different you know there's this the scientific method which I very muchbelieve in where something is true to
 the degree that it is test ibly so and and otherwise you're really justtalking about you know preferences or
 full-on untestable beliefs or that you know that kind of thing so ends up beingsomewhat of a semantic question where we
 were conflating a lot of things with the word intelligence if we parse them outand say you know all we headed towards
 the future where an AI will be able to out think us in every way then theanswer is unequivocally yes in order for


0:04:04
Speaker 1 :an AI system that needs to out think us
 in every way it also needs to have a capacity to have consciousnessself-awareness and Anjali will be


0:04:16
Speaker 0 :self-aware yes that's different from
 consciousness I need to be in terms words that what consciousness feels likeit feels like consciousness is in a
 different dimension but this is this could be just an illusionyou know if you damnit damage your brain
 in some way physically you get you you damage your consciousness which impliesthat consciousness is a physical
 phenomenon and in my view the thing is that that I think are really quite quitelikely is that digital intelligence will
 be able to out think us in every way and it will soon be able to simulate what weconsider consciousness so to agree that
 you would not be able to tell the

0:04:58
Speaker 1 :difference and from the from the aspect
 of the scientific method it's it might as well be consciousness if we can

0:05:05
Speaker 0 :simulate it perfectly if you can't tell
 the difference and this is sort of the Turing test but think of a more sort ofadvanced version of the Turing test if
 you if you're if you're talking to a digital super intelligence and can'ttell if that is a computer or a human
 like let's say just having conversation of a phone or a video conference orsomething where you're you you think
 you're talking look looks like person makes all of the right inflections andmovements and and all the small
 subtleties that constitute a human and talks like human makes mistakes likeyou're hearing like look at that and you
 literally just can't tell is this are youreally conversing with a person or or an
 AI might as well wear as well be human

0:05:56
Speaker 1 :so on a darker topic you've expressed
 serious concern about existential

0:06:04
Speaker 0 :threats of AI it's perhaps one of the


0:06:05
Speaker 1 :greatest challenges our civilization
 faces but since I would say we're kind of an optimistic descendants of apesperhaps we can find several paths of
 escaping the harm of AI so if I can give you three options maybe can commentwhich do you think is the most promising
 so one is scaling up efforts on AI safety and beneficial I research and inhope of finding an algorithmic or maybe
 a policy solution to is becoming a multiplanetary species as quickly aspossible and three is merging with AI
 and and riding the wave of that increasing intelligence as itcontinuously improves what do you think
 is most promising most interesting as a civilization that we should invest in I

0:06:53
Speaker 0 :think that's this a lot that responder
 investment going on nai whereas a lack of investment is in AIsafety and there should be in my view a
 cup an agency that oversees anything related to AI to confirm that it is doesnot represent a public safety risk just
 as there is a regulatory authority for this like the Food and DrugAdministration is that's the four corner
 automotive safety there's the FA for aircraft safety which generally comes aconclusion that it is important to have
 a government referee or a referee that is serving the public interest inensuring that things are safe when when
 there's a potential danger to the public I would argue that AI is unequivocallysomething that has potential to be
 dangerous to the public and therefore should have a regulatory agency just asother things that are dangerous to the
 public have a regulatory agency but let me tell you problems with this is thatthe government was very slowly and the
 rate of the usually way a regulatory agency comes into being is thatsomething terrible happens
 there's a huge public outcry and years after that there's a regulatory agencyor rule put in place takes something
 like like seatbelts it was known for on a decade or morethat seatbelts would have a massive
 impact on safety and and save so many lives in serious injuries and the carindustry fought the requirements put
 seatbelts in tooth and nail that's crazy yeah and and honor hundreds of thousandsof people probably died because of that
 and they said people wouldn't buy cars if their seatbelts just obviously absurdyou know or look at the back tobacco
 industry and how long they fought any thing about smoking that's part of why Ihelped make that movie thank you for
 smoking you can sort of see just how perniciousit can be when you have these companies
 that effectively achieve regulatory capture of government the bad people inthe AG community refer to the advent of
 digital superintelligence as a singularity that that is not to say thatit is good or bad but it that it is very
 difficult to predict what will happen after that point and and that there'ssome probability it will be bad some
 probably will be it will be good or if they want you to affect that probabilityand have it be more good than bad well


0:09:37
Speaker 1 :let me on the merger with AI question
 and the incredible work that's being done in your link there's a lot offascinating innovation here across
 different disciplines going on so the flexible wires the robotic sewingmachine that responds to brain movement
 everything around ensuring safety and so on so we currently understand verylittle about the human brain do you also
 hope that the work at neural link will help us understand more about our aboutthe human mind about the brain yeah the


0:10:12
Speaker 0 :work in your like will definitely shut a
 lot of insight into how the brain the mind works right now just the data wehave regarding the how the brain works
 is very limited we've collect fMRI which is that that's kind of like putting usyou know a stethoscope on the outside of
 a factory wall and then putting it like all over the factory wall and you cansort of hear the sounds but you don't
 know what machines are doing really yeah it's hard you can infer a few things butit's very poor brushstroke in order to
 really know what's going on in the brain you really need you have to have highprecision sensors and then you want to
 have stimulus and response like if you trigger a new one what how do you feelwhat do you see how does it change your
 perception of the world you're speaking

0:10:59
Speaker 1 :to physically just getting close to the
 brain being able to measure signals on the brain yeah will give us sort of openthe door and inside the factory yes


0:11:07
Speaker 0 :being able to have high precision
 sensors that tell you what individual neurons are doingand then being able to trigger a neuron
 and see what the responses in the brain so you can see the consequences of ifyou fire this neuron what happens how do
 you feel what is change it'll be really profound to have this inpeople because people can articulate
 their change like if there's a change in mood or if they've you know if they cantell you if they can see better or hear
 better or be able to form sentences better or worse or you know theirmemories are jogged or that kinda kind
 of thing

0:11:52
Speaker 1 :so on the human side there's this
 incredible general malleability plasticity of the human brain the humanbrain adapts adjusts and so on so it's


0:12:01
Speaker 0 :not that plastic to be totally Frank so


0:12:02
Speaker 1 :there's a firm structure but there
 nevertheless there's some plasticity and the open question is so if I could ask abroad question is how much that
 plasticity can be utilized sort of on the human side there's some plasticityin human brain and on the machine side
 we have neural networks machine learning artificial intelligence it's able toadjust and figure out signals so there's
 a mysterious language that we don't perfectly understand that's within thehuman brain and then we're trying to
 understand that language to communicate both directions so the brain isadjusting a little bit we don't know how
 much and the machine is adjusting where do you see as they try to sort of reachtogether almost like with an alien
 species try to find a protocol communication protocol that works wheredo you see the biggest the the biggest
 benefit arriving from on the machine side or the human side do you see both

0:13:01
Speaker 0 :of them working together I think the
 machine side is far more malleable and the biological side well huge around soit'll be the machine that adapts to the
 brain that's the only thing that's possible the brain can adapt that wellto to the machine you can't have neurons
 start to regard an electrode as a nook another neuron because you're not justdislike the pulse and so something else
 is pulsing see so this there is that there is that that elasticity in theinner
 which we believe is something that can happen but the vast majority ofmalleability will have to be on the


0:13:38
Speaker 1 :machine side but it's interesting when
 you look at that synaptic plasticity at the interface ID there might be like anemergent plasticity because it's a whole
 nother it's not like in the brain it's a whole nother extension of the brain youknow we might have to redefine what it
 means to be malleable for the brain so maybe the brain is able to adjust toexternal interfaces there will be some


0:13:59
Speaker 0 :adjustment to the brain because there's
 gonna be something reading and simulating the the brain and so it willadjust to to that thing but but well if
 the vast majority the adjustment will be on the machine side this is just if thisis just it has to be that otherwise it
 will not work ultimately like we don't currently operate on two layers we havesort of lamech you like prime primitive
 brain layer which is where all of our kind of impulses or coming from it'ssort of like we've got we've got like a
 monkey brain with a computer stuck on it that's that's the human brain and a lotof our impulses and everything are
 driven by the monkey brain and the computer of the cortex is constantlytrying to make the Montek monkey brain
 happy it's not the cortex that's steering the monkey right it's themonkey brain steering the cortex you
 know so the cortex is the part that

0:14:52
Speaker 1 :tells the story of the whole thing so we
 convince ourselves it's more interesting than just the monkey brain the cortex

0:14:58
Speaker 0 :just like what we'll call like human
 intelligence you know it's like that's like the advanced computer relative toother creatures like other creatures do
 not have either we're really they don't they don't have the computer or theyhave a very weak computer relative to
 humans but but it's just it's like it sort ofseems like surely the really smart thing
 should control the dumb thing but actually don't think it rolls this one

0:15:27
Speaker 1 :thing so do you think some of the same
 kind of machine learning methods whether that's natural language processingapplications are going to be applied for
 the communication between the Machine and the brain in to learn how to docertain things like movement of the body
 how to process visual stimuli and so on do you see the value of using machinelearning to understand the language of
 the two-way communication with the brain

0:15:54
Speaker 0 :yeah absolutely maybe we're a neural net
 and that you know AI is basically known that so it's like digital neural netwill interface with biological neural
 net and hopefully bring us along for the ride yeah but the vast majority ofaren't of our intelligence will be
 digital there's no like so like things like the the difference in intelligencebetween your the cortex and limbic
 system is gigantic your living system really has no comprehension of what thehell the cortex is doing it's just
 literally hungry you know or tired or angry or sexy or something you know it'san ad just and then it that communicates
 that's that impulse to the cortex and Tails the cortex to go satisfy that thena great deal of like a massive amount of
 thinking like truly this stupendous amount of thinking has gone into sexwithout purpose without provocation
 without procreation which which is actually quite a silly action in theabsence of procreation it's a bit silly
 the one why you doing it that's because it makes the limbic system happy that'swhy that's why but it's pretty absurd


0:17:20
Speaker 1 :really well the whole of existence is
 pretty absurd in some kind of sense yeah

0:17:25
Speaker 0 :but I mean this does a lot of
 computation has gone into how can I do more of thatwith the co-creation not even being a
 factor this is I think a very important area of research for NSFW an agency that

0:17:39
Speaker 1 :should receive a lot of funding


0:17:43
Speaker 0 :especially after this decision if I
 propose the formation of a new agency oh boy

0:17:51
Speaker 1 :what is the most exciting or some of the
 most exciting things that you see in the future impact of neural link both on thesize engineering a societal broad impact


0:18:02
Speaker 0 :so in your link I think that first will
 solve a lot of brain related diseases so creating from like autism schizophreniamemory loss like everyone experiences
 memory loss that at certain point in in age parents can't remember their kidsnames and that kind of thing so there's
 like mount of good that neural link can do in solving a critical critical damageto brain or the spinal cord there's a
 lot that can be done to improve quality of life of individuals and that will bethose three steps along the way and then
 ultimately it's intended to address the the risk of the existential risksassociated with digital super
 intelligence like we will not feel to be smarter than a digital supercomputer sotherefore if you cannot beat them join
 them and released we won't have that option

0:19:01
Speaker 1 :so you have hope that your link will be
 able to be a kind of connection to allow us to to merge to ride the wave of theimproving AI systems I think the chances


0:19:12
Speaker 0 :above zero percent it's nonzero yeah


0:19:15
Speaker 1 :there's a chance and that's so what I've


0:19:18
Speaker 0 :seen dumb and dumber yes so I'm saying
 there's a chance he's saying one in a

0:19:24
Speaker 1 :billion or one in a million whatever it
 was the dumb and dumber you know it went

0:19:28
Speaker 0 :from maybe one a million to improving
 maybe it'll be one in a thousand and then 100 then one in ten depends on therate of improvement of neural link and
 how fast we're able to do make progress you know well I've talked to a few folks

0:19:41
Speaker 1 :here quite brilliant engineers some I'm
 excited yeah I think it's like

0:19:45
Speaker 0 :fundamentally good you know who you know
 giving somebody back full motor control after they've had a spinal cord injuryyou know restoring brain functionality
 after a stroke solving debilitating genetically orange brain diseases theseare all incredibly great I think and in
 order to do these you have to be able to interface with the neurons at detaillevel and each build fire they're not
 write neurons read the write neurons and and then effectively you can create acircuit replace what's broken with with
 silicon and actually fill in them the missing functionality and then over timewe can have with develop a tertiary
 layer so if like limbic system is a primary layer then the cortex is like asector the second layer now and I said
 that you know the cortex is vastly more intelligent than the limbic system butpeople generally like the fact that they
 have a living system and a cortex I've met anyone who wants to lead either oneof them there like a girl keeping both


0:20:48
Speaker 1 :that's cool the limbic system is kind of
 fun

0:20:50
Speaker 0 :tell us what the fun is absolutely and
 then you people generally don't lose the cortex either all right they're likehaving the cortex and the limbic system
 yeah and and then there's a tertiary layer which will be digital superintelligence and I think there's room
 for optimism given that the cortex the cortex is very intelligent and limbicsystem is not and yet they work together
 well perhaps they can be a tertiary layer where digital super intelligencelies and that that will be vastly more
 intelligent than the cortex but still coexist peacefully and in the end of anEIN manner with the cortex and limbic


0:21:29
Speaker 1 :system that's a super exciting future
 both on the low-low of engineering that I saw is being done here and actualpossibility in the next few decades it's


0:21:37
Speaker 0 :important that Norling solved this
 problem sooner rather than later because the point at which we have digital superintelligence that's when we pass the
 singularity and and things become just very uncertain it doesn't mean thatthey're necessarily bad or good for the
 point which we passed singularity things become extremely unstable so we want tohave a human brain interface before the
 singularity or at least not long after it to minimize existential risk forHumanity and consciousness as we know it


0:22:05
Speaker 1 :but there's a lot of fascinating actual
 engineering a low-level problems here at your link that yeah quite quite exciting

0:22:14
Speaker 0 :what the problems that we face in your
 like art material science Electrical Engineering software mechanicalengineering micro fabrication it's a
 bunch of engineering disciplines essentially that's where it comes downto you have to have a a tiny electrode
 so so small it doesn't hurt hurt neurons but it's got to last for as long as aperson so it's gonna last for decades
 and then you've got to take that signal you've got to process that single lookssignal locally at low power so we need a
 lot of chip design engineers that you know cuz we're gonna do signalprocessing and do so in a very power
 efficient way so that we don't heat your brain up because the brain is very heatsensitive and then and then we're going
 to take those signals I'm going to do something with them and then we betterstimulate interest of stimulate the back
 too you know so you could buy directional communication so he's goodat material science software mechanical
 engineering Electrical Engineering trip design micro fabrication that's whatthose are the things we need to work on
 we need to a good material science so that the we can have tiny electrodesthat last a long time and as the tough
 thing with the science problems a tough one because you're trying to read andsimulate electrically in a an
 electrically active area your brain is very electrically active in electrochemically active so how do you have a
 coating on the electrode that doesn't dissolve over time and and is safe inthe brain this is a very hard problem
 and then and then how do you collect those signals in a way that is mostefficient because you really just have
 very tiny amounts of power to process those signals you know and then we needto automate the whole thing so it's like
 LASIK you know so it's just it's it's not if this is done by neurosurgeonsthere's no way it can scale to large
 numbers of people and it needs to scales large numbers of people because I thinkultimately we want the future repeated
 to be determined by a large number of the of humans do you think that this has

0:24:32
Speaker 1 :a chance to revolutionize surgery period
 so neurosurgery and Ellis yeah for sure

0:24:39
Speaker 0 :it's gotta be like lazy like you met if
 LASIK had to be hand done not done by hand by a person that wouldn't be greatyou know it's done by a robot and
 they'll off the mall it just kind of just needs to make sureyo-you heads in my position and then
 they just press button and go it's a

0:24:59
Speaker 1 :smart summon and soon Auto Park takes on
 the full beautiful mess of parking lots and their human human nonverbalcommunication I think it has actually
 the potential to have a profound impact in changing how our civilization looksat AI in robotics because this is the
 first time human beings people that don't own and test them Eve never seenit doesn't hurt about a Tesla get to
 watch hundreds of thousands of cars

0:25:27
Speaker 0 :without a driver yeah do you see it this


0:25:29
Speaker 1 :way almost like an education tool for
 the world about AI do you feel the burden of that the excitement of that ordo you just think it's a smart parking
 feature

0:25:39
Speaker 0 :I do think you are getting at something
 important which is most people have never really seen a robot or at and whatwhat is the card that is autonomous it's
 a four wheeled robot yeah the it

0:25:50
Speaker 1 :communicates a certain sort of message
 with everything from safety to the possibility of what AI could bring hiscurrent limitations its current
 challenges its what's possible do you feel the burden of that almost like acommunicator educator to the world about


0:26:06
Speaker 0 :AI we were just really trying to make
 fuels lives easier with autonomy but now you mention it I think it will be aneye-opener to people about robotics
 because they have really never seen most people never seen a robot and arehundreds of thousands of Tesla's won't
 be long before there's a million of them that have autonomous capability and thedrive without a person in it and you use
 you can see the kind of evolution of the cars personality and and thinking witheach iteration of autopilot you can see
 it's it's uncertain about this or it gets it but now it's more certain nownow it's moving in a slightly different
 way like I can tell immediately if a car is on tells autopilot because got justlittle nuances of movement it just moves
 in a slightly different way it will cause aunt Ella for example on thehighway are far more precise about being
 in the center of the lane than a person if you drive down the highway and lookat how at
 where cars are the human driven cars are in within their lane that like bumpercars then like moving all over the place
 the car and autopilot dead center

0:27:17
Speaker 1 :yes of the incredible work that's going
 into that in your network it's learning fast autonomy is still very very hard wedon't actually know how hard it is fully
 of course you look at the most problems you tackle this one included in with anexponential lens but even with an
 exponential improvement things can take longer than expected sometimes so wheredoes Tesla currently stand on its quest
 for full autonomy what's your sense when can we see successful deployment of full

0:27:54
Speaker 0 :autonomy well on the highway already the
 the probability of an intervention is extremely low yesso for highway autonomy with latest
 release especially the probability of need to intervene is this query isreally quite low in fact I'd say for
 stop-and-go traffic did its Matt as far safer than a person right now it's notforget the probability of an injury or
 an impact is much much lower for a pilot in a personand it was navigating
 change lanes take highway interchanges and then we're coming at it from theother direction which is low speed full
 autonomy and in a way this is like it's like how does a person learn to driveyou learn to drive in parking lot you
 know you know first time you learn to drive probably wasn't jumping on WolcottStreet in San Francisco
 that'd be crazy you're driving in the parking lot get things get things rightat low speed and and then the missing
 piece that were working on is traffic lights and stuff streets dr. Esaustreets obviously actually also
 relatively easy because you know you kind of know where the stuff Street iswas casing geocoded and then use
 visualization to see where the line is and stop the line to illuminate the GPSare so it actually this is probably
 complex traffic lights and very windy roads are the two things that need toget sold what's harder perception of


0:29:22
Speaker 1 :control for these problems so being able
 to perfectly perceive everything or figuring out a plan once you perceiveeverything how to interact with all the
 agents in the environment in your sense from a learning perspective isperception or action harder and then
 giant beautiful multitask learning

0:29:42
Speaker 0 :neural network the hardest thing is
 having a kur representation of the physical objects in vector space sotransportation the visual input
 primarily visual input some sonar and radar and and then at creating the anaccurate vector space representation of
 the objects around you once you have an accurate vectors based representationthe flanker and control is relatively
 easier it is relatively easy basically once you have accurate vectorrepresentation then then you're kind of
 like a video game like it cars in like Grand Theft Auto or something like theywork pretty well they drive down the
 road they don't crash you know pretty much unless you crash into them that'sbecause they've they've got an accurate
 vectors based representation of where the cars are and they're just bent andthen they're rendering that as the as
 the output you have a sense high level

0:30:33
Speaker 1 :

0:30:37
Speaker 0 :that Tesla's on track on being able to


0:30:39
Speaker 1 :achieve full autonomy so on the highway
 yeah yeah absolutely and still no driver state as a driver

0:30:48
Speaker 0 :sensing and we have driver sensing with
 talk in the wheel that's right yeah by

0:30:51
Speaker 1 :the way just a quick comment on karaoke
 most people think it's fun but I also think it's a driving featureI've been saying for a long time singing
 in a car is really good for attention management and vigilance management uh

0:31:04
Speaker 0 :sorry Tesla karaoke again it's great
 it's the one of the most fun features of the car do you think of a connection

0:31:10
Speaker 1 :between fun and safety sometimes yeah


0:31:12
Speaker 0 :they're both the same time that's great


0:31:16
Speaker 1 :I just met with and ruin wife of uh Carl
 Sagan oh yeah directed cut cosmos I'm

0:31:21
Speaker 0 :generally a big fan of Paul Sagan he's
 super cool and they had a great way of bringing thingsall that consciousness all civilization
 everything we've ever known and done is on this tiny blue dot people also getthey get too trapped in there this is
 like squabbles amongst humans and this don't think of a big picture they takecivilization and not continuing
 existence for granted I shouldn't do that look at the history ofcivilizations their eyes and they fall
 and now civilization is all it's globalized and so we're civilization Ithink now rises and falls together
 there's no there's not geographic isolation this is a big risk thingsdon't always go up that should be that's
 an important lesson of history in 1990

0:32:13
Speaker 1 :at the request of Carl Sagan the Voyager
 1 spacecraft which is a spacecraft that's reaching out farther thananything human made into space turned
 around to take a picture of Earth from 3.7 billionthe way and as you're talking about the
 pale blue dot that picture there takes up less than a single pixel in thatimage
 you know appearing as a tiny blue dot as pale blue dot as Carl Sagan called it sohe spoke about this dot of ours in 1994
 and if you could humor me I was wondering if in the last two minutes youcould read the words that he wrote
 described in this buildup sure yes

0:32:58
Speaker 0 :finally the universe appears to be 13.8
 billion years old earth-like four-and-a-half billion yearsold
 you know another half billion years or so the Sun will expand and probablyevaporate the oceans and make life
 impossible on earth which means that if it had taken consciousness temp sentlonger to evolve it would never have
 balled it all its attempts and longer and I wonder I wonder how many dead oneplanet civilizations that are out there
 in the cosmos that never made it to the other planet and ultimately extinguishthemselves or were destroyed by external
 factors probably a few it's only just possible to try to travel to Mars justbarely if G was 10% more wouldn't work
 really if it empty was 10% lower it would beeasy plucking go single stage from
 surface of module away surface of the earththere's Mars it's 37-cent with gravity
 they're about a giant blue stick you know forth channeling Costigan lookagain at that dot that's here that's
 home that's us on it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you've everheard of every human being who ever was
