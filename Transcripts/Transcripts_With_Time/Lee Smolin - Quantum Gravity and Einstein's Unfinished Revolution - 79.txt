Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with Lee
 Smolin he's a theoretical physicist co-inventor of loop quantum gravity anda contributor of many interesting ideas
 to cosmology quantum field theory the foundations of quantum mechanicstheoretical biology and the philosophy
 of science he's the author of several books including one that critiques thestate of physics and string theory
 called the trouble with physics and his latest book Einsteins unfinishedrevolution the search for what lies
 beyond the quantum he's an outspoken personality in the public debates on thenature of our universe among the top
 minds in the theoretical physics community this community has itsrespected academics it's naked Emperor's
 its outcasts in his revolutionaries its Mad Men and his dreamers this is whyit's an exciting world to explore it's a
 long-form conversation I recommend you listen back to the episodes with LeonardSusskind Sean Carroll Michio Kaku max
 tegmark Eric Weinstein and Jim Gates you might be asking why talk to physicist ifyou're interested in AI to me creating
 artificial intelligence systems requires more than Python and deep learning itrequires that we return to exploring the
 fundamental nature of the universe and the human mind theoretical physicistsventure out into the dark mysterious

 my conversation with Lee Smolin what is real let's start with an easy questionput another way how do we know what is
 real and what is merely a creation of our human perception and imagination we

0:03:13
Speaker 0 :don't know you don't know this is
 science I presume were talking about science and we believe or I believe thatthere is a world that is independent of
 my existence in my experience about it my knowledge of it and this I call the

0:03:34
Speaker 1 :real world so he said science but even


0:03:38
Speaker 0 :bigger than science what sure sure I
 need not have said this is science I just was you know warming up warming up

0:03:44
Speaker 1 :okay now that we're warmed up let's take
 a brief step outside of science is it completely a crazy idea to you thateverything that exists is merely
 creation of our mind so like there's a few not many this is outside of sciencenow people who believe sort of
 perception is fundamentally what's in our human perception the visual cortexand so on the the cognitive constructs
 that's being formed there is the reality and then anything outside is somethingthat we can never really grasp that's


0:04:23
Speaker 0 :the crazy idea too
 there's a version of that that is not crazy at all what we experienced isconstructed by our brains and by our
 brains in an active mode so we don't see the raw world we see a very processedworld we feel something was very
 processed through our brains and our brains are incredible but I stillbelieve that behind that experience that
 mirror fail or whatever you want to call it there is a real world and I'm curious

0:05:01
Speaker 1 :about it can we truly how do we get a
 sense of that real world is it through the tools of physics from theory to theexperiments or can we actually grasp it
 in in some intuitive way that's more connected to our ape ancestors or is itstill fundamentally the tools of math
 and physics that really allow us to grow

0:05:25
Speaker 0 :so let's talk about what tools they are
 what you say are the tools of math and physics I mean I think we're in the sameposition as our ancestors in the caves
 or before the caves or whatever we find ourselves in this world and we'recurious we also it's important to be
 able to explain what happens when there are fires when they're not fighters whatanimals and plants are good to eat and
 all that stuff and but we're also just curious we look up in the sky and we seethe Sun and the moon and the stars and
 we see some of those move in we're good we're very curious about that I thinkwe're just naturally curious so we make
 up this is my version of what I were we make up stories and explanations andwhere there are two things which I think
 are just true of being human we make judgments fast because we have to we'reto survive we is that a tiger is that
 not a tiger and we go act we have to act fast onincomplete information so we we judge
 quickly and we're off and wrong but at least sometimes wrong which is all Ineed for this we're off in Iran so we
 fool ourselves and we fool other people readily and so there's lots of storiesthat get told and some of them result in
 a concrete benefit and some of them

0:07:05
Speaker 1 :don't and so he said we're often wrong
 but what does it mean to be right right

0:07:11
Speaker 0 :that's that's the that's a that's an
 excellent question to be right well since I'm I believe that there is areal world I believe that to be you can
 challenge me on this if you're not a realistic realistic somebody whobelieves in these this real objective
 world which is independent of our perception if I'm a realistI think that to be right is to come
 closer I think first of all this a relative scale is not right and wrongthis writer more right than less right
 and you're more right if you come closer to an exact true description of thatreal world now can we know that for sure


0:07:55
Speaker 1 :now in the scientific method is
 ultimately what allows us to get a sense of how close were getting to that real

0:08:02
Speaker 0 :world no one to counts first of all I
 don't believe his scientific method ha I was very influenced when I was ingraduate school by the writings of Paul
 fire Robin who was enough an important philosopher of science who argue thatthere is no scientific method there is


0:08:18
Speaker 1 :or there is not there's not can you
 elaborate if sorry if you were going to but can you elaborate on the what doesit mean for there not to be a scientific
 method this notion that I think a lot of people believe in in this day and age

0:08:34
Speaker 0 :sure Paul Farben or he was a student of
 popper who taught opera Karl Popper and Farben argued both by logic and byhistorical exam
 well that you named anything that should be part of the practice of science sayyou should always make sure that your
 theories agree with all the data that's always meant it's already been taken andhe'll prove to you that there have to be
 times when science contradicts when some scientist contradicts that advice forscience to progress overall so it's not
 a simple matter I think that of science as a community and a peopleof people and as a community of people
 bound by certain ethical precepts precepts whatever that so in that

0:09:35
Speaker 1 :community a set of ideas they operate
 under I'm meaning ethically of kind of the rules of the game they operate under

0:09:44
Speaker 0 :don't lie report all your results
 whether they agree or don't agree with your hypothesis check the training of ascientist mostly consists of methods of
 checking because again we make lots of mistakes we're very error-pronebut there are tools both on the
 mathematics and the experimental side to check and double-check and triple-checkand a scientist goes through a training
 and I think this is part of it you can't just walk off the street and say yo I'ma scientist you have to go through the
 training and the training the test that lets you be done with the training iscan you form a convincing case for
 something that your colleagues will not be able to shout down because the lastdid you check this and did you check
 that and did you check this and what about seeming contradiction with thisand you've got to have answers to all
 those things or you don't get taken seriously and when you get to the pointwhere you can produce that kind of
 defense and argument then they give you a PhD that's and you're kind of licensedyou're still going to be questioned and
 you still may propose or publish mistakes but the community is gonna haveto waste less time fixing your mistakes


0:11:16
Speaker 1 :yes but if you can maybe linger on it a
 little longer what's the gap between the thing that that community does and theideal of the scientific method was the
 scientific method is you should be able to repeat an experimentthere's a lot of elements to what
 construes the the scientific method but the final result the hope of it is thatyou should be able to say with some
 confidence that a particular thing is close to the truth right but there's not

0:11:52
Speaker 0 :a simple relationship between experiment
 and hypothesis or theory for example Galileo did this experiment of droppinga ball from the top of a tower and it
 falls right at the base of the tower and an Aristotelian would say Wowof course it falls right to the base of
 the tower that shows that the earth isn't moving while the ball is fallingand Galileo says no wait there's a
 principle of inertia and has an inertia in the direction with the earth isn'tmoving and the tower and the ball in the
 or thought moves together when the principle of inertia tells you at his atthe bottom it does look like therefore
 my principle of inertia is right you know Stettin Ian says no peristylescience is right the earth is stationary
 and so you gotta get an interconnected bunch of cases and work hard to line upand isolated centuries to make the
 transition from Aristotelian physics to the new physics it wasn't done tillNewton in 1687 in 1687 so what do you


0:13:01
Speaker 1 :think is the nature of the process that
 seems to lead to progress if we at least look at the long arc of science of allthe community of scientists they seem to
 do a better job of coming up with ideas that engineers can then take on andbuild rockets with or build computers
 with or build cool stuff with I don't

0:13:25
Speaker 0 :know a better job than what


0:13:29
Speaker 1 :then this previous century so century by
 century we can talk about we'll talk about string theory and so on and kindof possible well you might think of as
 dead ends and and so on not do it we

0:13:41
Speaker 0 :will string whistles straight


0:13:44
Speaker 1 :but there's never less than science very
 often at least temporary dead ends but if you if you look sure at the throughcenturies
 you know the century before Newton in the century after Newton it seems like alot of ideas came closer to the truth
 that then could be usable by our civilization to build the iPhone rightto build cool things that improve our
 quality of life that's the progress I'm

0:14:18
Speaker 0 :kind of referring to let me can I say


0:14:21
Speaker 1 :that more precisely yes I think it's a


0:14:23
Speaker 0 :it's important to get the time places
 right yes there was a scientific revolution that partly succeeded betweenabout 1900 or late 1890s and into the 22
 1930s 1940s and so and maybe some if she stretched it into the 1970s and thetechnology this was the discovery of
 relativity and that included a lot of developments of electromagnetism theconformation which wasn't really well
 confirmed into the 20th century that matter was made of atoms and the wholepicture of nuclei with electrons going
 around this is early 20th century and then quantum mechanics was from 1905 ittook a long time to develop to the late
 1920s and then it was basically in final form and the basis of this partialrevolution we can come back to why it's
 only a partial revolution is the basis of the technologies you mentioned all ofI mean electrical technology was being
 developed slowly with this and in fact there's a close relation betweendevelopment of electric electricity and
 the electrification of cities in the United States and Europe and so forthand the development of the science the
 size of the fundamental physics since the early 1970s doesn't have a storylike that and so far there's not a
 series of triumphs and progresses and there's not a there's not any practical

0:16:20
Speaker 1 :application so just to linger briefly on
 the early 20th century and the revolutions in science that happenedthere what was the method by which the
 scientific community kept each other in check about when you get something rightwhen you get something wrong is
 experimental validation ultimately the

0:16:43
Speaker 0 :final test it's absolutely necessary and
 the key things were all validated two key predictions of quantum mechanics andof the theory of electricity and


0:16:53
Speaker 1 :magnetism so before we talk about
 Einstein now your new book before string theory quantum mechanics on let's take astep back at a higher level question
 what is that you mentioned what is realismwhat is anti realism and maybe why do
 you find realism as you mentioned so

0:17:16
Speaker 0 :compelling realism is you is the belief
 in the in an external world independent of our existence our perception ourbelief our knowledge a realist as a
 physicist is somebody who believes that there should be possible some completelyobjective description of each and every
 process at the fundamental level which which describes and explains exactlywhat happens and why it happened


0:17:53
Speaker 1 :that kind of implies that that system in
 a realist view is deterministic meaning there's no fuzzy magic going on that youcan never get to the bottom you can get
 to the bottom of anything and perfectly

0:18:06
Speaker 0 :describe it some people would say that
 I'm not interested in determinism but I I could live with the fundamental worldwhich which had some chance in it so


0:18:18
Speaker 1 :deep he said you could live with it but
 do you think God plays dice in our

0:18:25
Speaker 0 :universe I think it's probably much
 worse than that

0:18:30
Speaker 1 :in which direction I think that theories


0:18:31
Speaker 0 :can change and theories unchanged
 without warning I think the future is open

0:18:38
Speaker 1 :you mean the fundamental laws of physics
 can change you okay we'll get there I thought I thought we would be able tofind some solid ground but apparently
 for the ground is the entirety of it temporarily so probably okay let's uhso realism is the idea that while the
 ground is solid you can describe it what's the role of the human beingour beautiful complex human mind in the
 in realism do we have them are we just another set of molecules connectedtogether in a clever way or the observer
 this is the observer our human mind consciousness have a role in thisrealism view of the physical universe


0:19:27
Speaker 0 :there's two ways there's two questions
 you can be asking it does our conscious mind you are perceptions play a role inmaking things become in making things
 real or if things becoming that's question one question two is does thiswe can call it a naturalist view of the
 world that is based on realism allow a place to understand the existence of andthe nature of perceptions and
 consciousness in mind and that's question twoquestion two I do think a lot about and
 my answer which is nine answers I hope so but it certainly doesn't yet so what

0:20:14
Speaker 1 :

0:20:14
Speaker 0 :question one I don't think so but of
 course the answer to question one depends on question two right so I'm notup to question one yeah the question two


0:20:24
Speaker 1 :is the thing that you can kind of
 struggle with at this time as what about the anti-realists so what flavour whatare the different camps of anti-realist
 that you've talked about I think it'd be nice if you can articulate for thepeople for whom there is not a very
 concrete real world as there's divisions or there's a it's Messier then therealist view of the universe what are
 the different camps for the different

0:20:54
Speaker 0 :views I'm I'm not sure I'm a I'm a good
 scholar and can talk about the different camps and analyze it but some many ofthe inventors of quantum physics were
 not realness weren't I realist in their scholarship they lived in a veryperilous time between the two world wars
 and there were a lot of trends in culture which were going that way but inany case they said things like the
 purpose of science is not to give an objective realist description ofnature's it would be in our absence this
 movie might be saying Niels Bohr the purpose of science is as anextension of our conversations with each
 other to describe our interactions with nature and we're free to invent and useterms like particle or wave or a
 causality or a time or space if they're useful to us and they carry someintuitive implication but we shouldn't
 believe that they actually have to do with what nature would be like in ourabsence which we have nothing to say


0:22:04
Speaker 1 :about do you find any aspect of that
 because you kind of said that we human beings tell stories defined aspects ofthat kind of entire realist view of
 Niels Bohr compelling that were fundamentally arestorytellers and then we create tools of
 space and time and causality and whatever this fun quantum mechanic stuffis to help us tell the story of our


0:22:32
Speaker 0 :world sure I just would like to believe
 that is an aspiration for the other

0:22:39
Speaker 1 :thing driving being what the the realist


0:22:41
Speaker 0 :point of view do you hope that the


0:22:44
Speaker 1 :stories will eventually lead us to
 discovering discovering the real world as it is yeah it's perfection possible

0:22:56
Speaker 0 :

0:22:57
Speaker 1 :by the way though


0:22:59
Speaker 0 :oh well that's you mean will we ever get
 there and know that we're there yeah exactly that's not mine that's forpeople 5,000 years in the future we're
 certainly nowhere near there yeah do you

0:23:13
Speaker 1 :think reality that exists our sight
 outside of our mind do you think there's a limit to our cognitive abilities isagain descendants of apes for just
 biological systems is there a limit to our minds capability to actuallyunderstand reality sort of there comes a
 point even with the help of the tools of physics that we just cannot grasp somefundamental aspects of that again I


0:23:46
Speaker 0 :think that's a question for 5,000 years
 in the future element I think there is a universality here I don't agree withDavid Deutsch about everything but I
 admire the way he put things in his last book and he talked about the role ofexplanation and he talked about the
 universality of certain languages of the universality of mathematics or ofcomputing and so forth and he believed
 that universality which is something real which is it somehow comes out ofthe fact that the symbolic system in a
 mathematical system can refer to itself and in every I forget what that's calledin reference
 back to itself and build in which he argued for a universality of possibilityfor our understanding whatever is out
 there but I'm I admire that argument but I it seems to me we're doing okay so farbut we'll have to see whether there is a


0:24:53
Speaker 1 :limit or not for now we got we got


0:24:57
Speaker 0 :plenty to play with yeah there are
 things which are right there in front of us which we miss and I'll quote myfriend Eric Weinstein in saying look
 Einstein carried his luggage Freud carried his luggage Marx carried hisluggage Martha Graham carried her
 luggage etcetera Edison carried his luggage all these geniuses carry theirluggage and not once before relatively
 recently did it occur to anybody to put a wheel on luggage and pull it and itwas right there waiting to be invented


0:25:35
Speaker 1 :for centuries so this is Erik Y Stein
 yeah what do the wheels represent are you basically saying that there's stuffright in front of our eyes that once we
 it just clicks we put the wheels in the luggage a lot of things will fall into

0:25:50
Speaker 0 :place yes that I do I do and every day I
 wake up and think why can't I be that guy who was walking through the airport

0:26:00
Speaker 1 :what do you think it takes to be that
 guy because link you said a lot of reallysmart people carried their luggage


0:26:09
Speaker 0 :

0:26:09
Speaker 1 :mm-hmm what just psychologically
 speaking so Erik wants that is a good example of a person who thinks outsidethe box yes who resists almost
 conventional thinking you're an example of a person who by habit by psychologyby upbringing I don't know but resists
 conventional thinking as well just by Nature that's that's a complimentgood so what do you think it takes to do
 that is that something you were just

0:26:39
Speaker 0 :born with I doubt it well from my
 studying some cases because I'm curious about that obviously and just in a moreconcrete way when I start out in physics
 because I started a long way from physics so it took me a long not a longtime but a lot of work to get to study
 it and get into so I did wonder about that and so I read the biographies andin fact I started with the autobiography
 of Einstein and Newton in Galileo and all those all those people and I thinkthere's a couple of things some of it is
 luck being in the right place the right timesome of it is stubbornness and arrogance
 which can easily go wrong yes and I know I know all of these aredoorways if you go through them slightly
 at the wrong speed or any wrong angle they're their ways to fail but if yousomehow have the right look the right
 confidence and arrogance caring I think Einstein cared to understandnature with ferocity and commitment that
 exceeded other people of his time so he asked more stubborn questions he askeddeeper questions I think and there's a
 level of ability and whether ability is born in or can be developed at a sensorwhich can be developed like any of these
 things like musical talent dimension ego

0:28:25
Speaker 1 :what's the role of ego in that process
 confidence confidence but you do in your own life if you found yourself walkingthat nice edge of too much or too little
 so being overconfident and therefore leading yourself astray or notsufficiently confident to throw away the
 conventional thinking of whatever the theory of the day of theoretical physics

0:28:50
Speaker 0 :I don't know if I I mean I've
 contributed where I've contributed whether if I had had moreconfidence in some things I would have
 gotten further I don't know whether certainly hi I'm sitting here at thismoment with very much my own approach to
 telling everything and I'm calm I'm happy about that but onthe other hand I know people whose
 self-confidence vastly exceeds mine and sometimes I think it's justified andsometimes I think it's not justified


0:29:32
Speaker 1 :your most recent book titled Einstein's
 unfinished revolution so I have to ask what is Einsteins unfinished revolutionand also how do we finish it well that's


0:29:44
Speaker 0 :something I've been trying to do my
 whole life but Einsteins unfinished revolution is the twin revolutions whichinvented relativity theory special and
 especially general relativity and quantum theory which he was the firstperson to realize in 1905 there would
 have to be a radically different theory which somehow realized to resolve theparadox of the duality of particle wave


0:30:14
Speaker 1 :for photons and he was I mean people I
 think don't always associate I style with quantum mechanics because I thinkhis connection with it
 founding as a one of the founders I would say of quantum mechanics he kindof put it in the closet is it well he


0:30:31
Speaker 0 :didn't believe that the quantum
 mechanics as it was developed in the late 19th middle late 1920s wascompletely correct at first he didn't
 believe it at all then he was convinced that it'sconsistent but incomplete and that also
 is my view it needs for various reasons I can elucidate to have additionaldegrees of freedom particles forces
 something to reach the stage where it gives a complete description of eachphenomena and as I was saying realism
 demands so what aspect of quantum

0:31:07
Speaker 1 :mechanics
 bothers you and Einstein the most is it some aspect of the wavefunction collapsediscussions the measurement problem is
 it the the the measurement problem I'm

0:31:22
Speaker 0 :not gonna speak for Einstein but the
 measurement problem basically and the

0:31:31
Speaker 1 :fact that what is the measurement


0:31:34
Speaker 0 :problem sorry the basic formulation of
 quantum mechanics gives you two ways to evolve situations in time one of them isexplicitly when no observer is observing
 or no measurement is taking place and the other is when a measurement orobservation is taking place and they can
 treat they basically contradict each other but there's another reason why therevolution wasn't completed which is we
 don't understand the relationship between these two parts generalrelativity which became our best theory
 of space and time and gravitation and cosmology and quantum theory so for the

0:32:11
Speaker 1 :most part general relativity describes
 big things quantum theory describes little thingsand that's the revolution that we found
 really powerful tools to describe big things and little things and it'sunfinished because you wouldn't have two
 totally separate things and we need to figure out how to connect them so it candescribe everything right and we either


0:32:32
Speaker 0 :do that if we believe quantum mechanics
 as understood now is correct by bringing general relativity or some extension orgeneral relativity that describes
 gravity and so forth into the quantum domain that's called quantize the theoryof gravity or if you believe with
 Einstein that quantum mechanics needs to be completed and this is my view thenpart of the job of finding the right
 completion or extension of quantum mechanics would be one that incorporatedspace-time in gravity so where do we


0:33:12
Speaker 1 :begin so first let me ask perhaps you
 can give me a chance if I could ask you some just really basic questions wellthere
 at all the basic questions and the hardest but you mentioned space-timewhat is space-time space-time you talked


0:33:28
Speaker 0 :about a construction so I believe the
 space-time is a intellectual construction that we make of the eventsin the universe I believe the events are
 real and the relationships between the events which cause which are real butthe idea that here is a four-dimensional
 smooth geometry which has a metric in the connection and satisfies theequations that Einstein wrote it's a
 good description to some scale it's a good approximation it captures some ofwhat's really going on in nature but I
 don't believe it for a minute is fundamental so okay let's we're gonna

0:34:09
Speaker 1 :allow me to linger on that so the
 universe has events events cause other events there's this idea of causalityokay so that that's happy let's in my in


0:34:22
Speaker 0 :

0:34:24
Speaker 1 :

0:34:25
Speaker 0 :your view Israel or hypothesis so the
 theories that I have been working to develop make that assumption

0:34:32
Speaker 1 :so space-time you said four dimensional
 space is kind of the location of things and time is whatever the heck time isand you're saying that space-time is
 both space and time are emergent and not fundamental no sorrybefore you correct me what is mean to be
 fundamental or emergent fundamental

0:34:59
Speaker 0 :means it's part of the description as
 far down as you go we have real yes as

0:35:05
Speaker 1 :real as real it could be yeah so I think


0:35:07
Speaker 0 :the time is fundamental and quote goes
 all the way down and space does not and the combination of them we use ingeneral relativity that we call
 space-time also it is not but what is

0:35:20
Speaker 1 :

0:35:23
Speaker 0 :time then I think that time the activity
 of time is the continual creation of events from existing event so if there's

0:35:34
Speaker 1 :no events


0:35:36
Speaker 0 :there's nothing then there's not only
 not no time there's no nothing so so I believe that history universe has ahistory which goes to the past I believe
 that a future does not exist there's a notion of a present and a notion of thepast and the past consists of is a story
 about events that took place to our past

0:36:03
Speaker 1 :she said the future doesn't exist yes


0:36:06
Speaker 0 :

0:36:08
Speaker 1 :could you say that again can you try to
 give me a chance to understand that one more time so what the events causedother events
 what is this universe because we'll talk about locality in nonlocality

0:36:23
Speaker 0 :good because it's the crazy I mean it's


0:36:25
Speaker 1 :not crazy it's a beautiful set of ideas
 that you you propose but and if because all these fundamental I just like tounderstand it better
 what is him what is the past what is the future what is the flow of time even theera of time in our universe in your view
 and maybe it was an event right Oh an

0:36:50
Speaker 0 :event is where something changes or
 where to I it's hard to say because it's a primitive concept in the event is amoment of time within space this is the
 the view and general relativity where two particles intersect in their pathsor something changes in the path of the
 particle now we are postulating the theories I have two fundamental level anotion which is an elementary notion so
 it doesn't have a definition in terms of other things but it is somethingelementary happening and it's it doesn't


0:37:34
Speaker 1 :have a connection to energy or matter or
 exchange of any ties to have the

0:37:38
Speaker 0 :connection energies at that level


0:37:40
Speaker 1 :

0:37:42
Speaker 0 :yeah it involves and that's why the
 version of a theory of that I've developed with Marina Cortezand they say by the way I want to
 mention my collaborators because they've been at least as important in this workas I have marina Cortes in all the works
 since about 2013 2012-2013 about causality Carlos set and in the periodbefore that Roberto mangabeira Unger who
 is a philosopher and a professor of law

0:38:14
Speaker 1 :and that's in your efforts
 together with your collaborators to finish the unfinished revolution so yeahand focus on causality and focus on


0:38:23
Speaker 0 :

0:38:23
Speaker 1 :mental yes as fundamental to physics so


0:38:27
Speaker 0 :and there's certainly other people we've
 worked with but those two people's thinking had a huge influence on my ownthinking so in the way you describe


0:38:35
Speaker 1 :causality that's what you mean
 of time being fundamental that causality

0:38:42
Speaker 0 :is from the yes and what does it mean


0:38:43
Speaker 1 :for space to not be fundamental to be
 though that's very good this is a level

0:38:48
Speaker 0 :of description in which there events
 there are events create other events but there's no spacethey don't live in space they have an
 order in which they caused each other and that is part of the nature of timefor us so but but there is an emergent
 approximate description and you asked me to find a version I didn't an emergentproperty is a property that arises at
 some level of complexity larger than and more complex than the fundamental levelwhich requires some property to describe
 it which is not directly explicable or drivable is the word I want from theproperties of the fundamental things and


0:39:48
Speaker 1 :space is one of those things in a
 sufficiently complex universe space three-dimensional position of things

0:39:57
Speaker 0 :emerged yes and we have this we saw how
 this happened in detail in some models bothcomputationally and analytically ok so


0:40:07
Speaker 1 :connected to space is the idea of
 locality yes that so we talked about realism so I I live in this world atlike sports
 you know locality is a thing that you know you can affect things close to youand don't have an effect on things that
 are far away mm-hmm it's the thing that bothers me about gravity in general oraction in a distance the same thing that
 probably bothered Newton or at least he said a little bit about it okay so what

0:40:41
Speaker 0 :

0:40:43
Speaker 1 :do you think about localities it's just
 a construct is it us humans just like this idea and are connected to itbecause we exist in it we need it for
 our survival but it's not fundamental I mean it seems crazy for it not to be afundamental aspect of our reality it


0:41:01
Speaker 0 :

0:41:03
Speaker 1 :does and you comfort me and a sort of as
 a therapist like how do i I'm not a good

0:41:07
Speaker 0 :therapist okay there are several
 different definitions of locality when you come to talk about locality inphysics in quantum field theory which is
 a mixture of special relativity and quantum mechanics there is a precisedefinition of locality operative field
 operators corresponding to events in space-time which are space likeseparated can meet with each other as
 operators so in the in quantum mechanics

0:41:41
Speaker 1 :you think about the nature realities
 fields and things that are close and if you have an impact on each other more

0:41:52
Speaker 0 :than farther away that's yes that's very


0:41:54
Speaker 1 :comforting that makes sense so that's a


0:41:56
Speaker 0 :property of quantum field theory and
 it's well tested unfortunately there is another definition of local which wasexpressed by Einstein and expressed more
 precisely by John Bell which has been tested experimentally and foundfail and this setup is you take two
 particles so one thing that's really weird about quantum mechanics is aproperty called entanglement you can
 have two particles interact and then share a property without it being aproperty of either one of the two
 particles and if you take such a system and then you magically make ameasurement on particle a which is over
 here on my right side and particle B which is over here and what somebodyelse makes a measurement in a particle B
 you can ask that whatever is the real reality of particle B it not be affectedby the choice the observer at particle a
 makes about what to measure not the outcome just the choice of the differentthings they might measure and that's a
 notion of locality because it assumes that these things are very far spacelike separated and it's going to take a
 while for any information about the choice made by the people here at a toaffect the reality of B but you make
 that assumption that's called bell locality and you derive a certaininequality that some correlation
 functions of correlations have to satisfy and then you can test thatpretty directly in experiments which
 create pairs of photons or other particles and it's wrong by many sigma

0:43:47
Speaker 1 :in experiment in is a match so what what
 does that mean that means that that

0:43:52
Speaker 0 :definition of locality I stated is false


0:43:56
Speaker 1 :the the one that Einstein was playing


0:43:59
Speaker 0 :with and the one the one that I stated
 that is it's not true that whatever is real about particle B is unaffected bythe choice that the observer makes as to
 what to measure in particle a no matter how long they've been propagating andalmost the speed of light or the speed
 of light away from each other it's no

0:44:19
Speaker 1 :matter so like the distance between them


0:44:22
Speaker 0 :well it's been tested of course if you
 want to have hope for quantum mechanics Pin completely wrong and corrected by
 something that changes this it's been tested over a number of kilometers Idon't remember whether it's 25
 kilometers or 170 kilometers but so in

0:44:42
Speaker 1 :trying to solve the unsolved revolution
 in trying to come up with a theory for everything is causality fundamental andbreaking away from locality absolutely
 fun a crucial step so the in your book essentially those are the two things wereally need to think about as a
 community especially the physics community has to think about this okay Iguess my question is how do we solve how
 do we finish the unfinished revolution

0:45:19
Speaker 0 :well that's I can only tell you what I'm
 trying to do and what I have abandoned yes it's not working as one ant smart

0:45:28
Speaker 1 :ant in an ant colony yep or maybe dumb


0:45:32
Speaker 0 :that's why he knows but anyway that's
 become my view of the we've had some nice theories invented there's a bunchof different ones both related to
 quantum mechanics related to quantum gravity there's a lot to admire in manyof these different approaches but to my
 understanding they none of them completely solve the problems that Icare about and so we're in a situation
 which is either terrifying for students or full of opportunity for the rightstudent in which we've got more than a
 dozen attempts and I never thought I don't think anybody anticipated wouldwork out this way which work partly and
 then at some point they have an issue that nobody can figure out how to goaround or how to solve and that's the
 situation we're in my reaction to that is twofold one of them is to try tobring him we evolved into this
 unfortunate sociological situation in which there are communities around someof these approaches and to borrow again
 a metaphor from Eric they sit on top of hills in the landscape of theories andthrow rocks in each other and as eric
 says we need two things we need people to get off their hills and come downinto valleys and party and talk and
 become friendly and it's learning to say not know but but yes and yes your ideagoes this far but maybe if we put it
 together with my idea we could go further yes so in that spirit of talked

0:47:25
Speaker 1 :several times with Sean Carroll who's
 also written an excellent book recently and he kind of he plays around is a bigfan of the many-worlds interpretation of
 quantum mechanics so I'm a troublemaker so let me ask well what's your sense ofSean and the idea of many-worlds
 interpretation I've read many the commentary back andforth you guys you guys are friendly
 respect each other but have a lot of fun

0:47:57
Speaker 0 :debating I love Sean and he know I
 really he's not he's articulate and he's a great representative or an ambassadorof science to the public in four
 different fields of science to each other he also like I do takes philosophyseriously and
 unlike what I do in all cases he has really done the homework he's read a lothe knows the people he talks to them he
 exposes his arguments to the to them and I did this mysterious thing that we sooften end up on the opposite sides of
 with these issues it's fun though it's fun and I'd love to have a conversationabout that but I would want to include
 him

0:48:50
Speaker 1 :I see about many worlds well no I can


0:48:52
Speaker 0 :tell you what I think about many I'd
 love to but actually on that let me

0:48:54
Speaker 1 :pause Sean as a podcast you should
 definitely figure out how to talk to Sean I would I actually told Sean Iwould love to hear you guys just going
 back and forth so I hope you can make that happen eventually you and sure I

0:49:08
Speaker 0 :want I won't tell you what it is but
 there's something that Sean said to me in June of 2016 that changed my wholeapproach to a problem but I have to tell


0:49:19
Speaker 1 :him first yes and that that's they'll be
 great to tell him on his podcast so I

0:49:24
Speaker 0 :can't invite myself to his podcast yeah


0:49:27
Speaker 1 :okay we'll make it happen
 so so many worlds anyway um what's your

0:49:31
Speaker 0 :

0:49:31
Speaker 1 :view many worlds we talk about
 nonlocality many worlds is also a very uncomfortable idea or beautifuldepending on your perspective it's it's
 very nice in terms of I mean there's a realist aspect to it I think you calledit magical realism yeah it's just a


0:49:53
Speaker 0 :

0:49:54
Speaker 1 :beautiful line but at the same time it's
 very difficult to far eliminate human minds to comprehend so what it what are

0:50:04
Speaker 0 :your thoughts about it let me start with
 the easy and obvious and then go to the scientific okay it doesn't appeal to meit doesn't answer the questions that I
 want answered and it does so to such a strong case that when Roberto mangabeiraUnger and I began looking for principles
 and I want to come back and talk about the use of principles in science cuzthat's the other thing I was gonna say
 and I don't want to lose that when we started looking for principleswe made our first principle there is
 just one world that happens once but so it's it's not helpful to my personalapproach to my personal agenda but of
 course I'm part of a community and my sense of the many-worlds interpretationI have thought a lot about it and
 struggled a lot with it is the following first of all there's Everett himselfthere's what's in Everett and there are
 several issues they're connected with the derivation of the born rule which isthe rule that gives probabilities to
 events and the reasons why there is a problem with probability is that Imentioned the two ways that physical
 systems can evolve the many-worlds interpretation cuts off one the onehaving to do with measurement and just
 has the other one the Schrodinger evolution which is smooth evolution ofthe quantum state but the notion of
 probability is only in the second rule which we've thrown away so where there'sprobably come from and you have to
 answer the question because experimentalist use probabilities tocheck the theory now at first sight you
 get very confused because there seems to be a real problem because in themany-worlds interpretation the this talk
 about branches is not quite precise but I'll use it there is a branch in whicheverything that might happen does happen
 with probability one in that branch you might think you could count the numberof branches in which things do and don't
 happen and get numbers that you can define as something like frequentistprobabilities and Everett did have an
 argument in that direction but the argument gets very subtle when there arean infinite number of
 abilities as is the case in most quantum systems and my understanding althoughI'm not as much of an expert as some
 other people is that Everett's own proposal it's failed did not workthere then it doesn't stop there there
 is an important idea that Everett didn't know about which is decoherence and itis a phenomenon that might be very much
 relevant and so a number of people post Everett have tried to make versions ofwhat you might call many worlds quantum
 mechanics and this is a big area and it's subtle and it's not the kind ofthing that I do well so I consulted
 that's why there's two chapters on this in the book I wrote chapter 10 which isabout Everett's version in Chapter 11
 there is a very good group of philosophers of physics in Oxford SimonSaunders David Wallace Harvey Brown and
 a number of others and of course is David Deutsch who is there and thosepeople have developed and put a lot of
 work into a very sophisticated set of ideas designed to come back and answerthat question they have the flavor of
 there are really no probabilities we admit that but imagine if you if theEverett story was true and you were
 living in that multiverse how would you make bets and so they they use decisiontheory from the theory of probability in
 gambling and so forth to shape a story of how you would bet if you were insideaverage in the universe and you knew
 that and there is a debate among those experts as to whether they or somebodyelse has really succeeded and when I
 checked in as I was finishing the book with some of those people like Simonwho's a good friend of mine
 and David Wallace they told me that they weren't sure that any of them was yetcorrect so that's why I put in my book
 now to add to that sean has his own approach to that problem in what'scalled self referencing or self locating
 observers and it doesn't I just tried to read it and it didn'tmake sense to me but I didn't study it
 hard I didn't communicate with Sean I didn't do the things that I would do soI had nothing to say about in the book
 and I don't I don't know whether it's right or not let's talk a little bit

0:55:34
Speaker 1 :about science you mentioned these
 principles in science what does it mean to have a principle and why is that

0:55:45
Speaker 0 :important when I feel very frustrated
 about quantum gravity I like to go back and read history and of course Einsteinand his achievements are a huge lesson
 and hopefully something like a role model and it's very clear the Einsteinthought that the first job when you want
 to enter a new domain of theoretical physics is to discover and inventprinciples and then make models of how
 those principles might be applied in some experimental situation which iswhere the mathematics comes in so for
 Einstein there was no unified space in timeMinkowski invented this idea of
 space-time Fry's time it was a model of his principles or his past humans andI've taken the view that we don't know
 the principles of quantum gravity I can think about candidates and I have somepapers where I discuss different
 candidates and I'm happy to discuss them but my belief now is that thosepartially successful approaches are all
 models which might describe indeed some quantum gravity physics in some domainand
 aspect but ultimately could would be important because they model theprinciples and the first job is to tie
 down those principles so that's the approach that I'm taking so the so

0:57:22
Speaker 1 :speaking of principles in your 2006 book
 the trouble with physics you criticized a bit string theory for taking us awayfrom the rigors of the scientific method
 or whatever you would call it but what's the trouble with physics today and howdo we fix it can I say how I read that


0:57:44
Speaker 0 :book sure because I and I'm not this of
 course has to be my fault because you can't as an author to claim after allthe work he put in this you were misread
 but I will I will say that many of the reviewers who were not personallyinvolved in even many who were working
 on string theory or some other approach to quantum gravity told me communicatewith me and told me they thought that I
 was fair and balanced was though was the way that was usually is so let me tellyou what my purpose was in writing that
 book which clearly got diverted by because there was already a rather hardargument going on and this is on which


0:58:36
Speaker 1 :topic on string theory specifically or
 in general and physics know more

0:58:41
Speaker 0 :specifically than string theory so since
 we're in Cambridge can I say that we're doing this yeah Cambridge just to be

0:58:49
Speaker 1 :clear Massachusetts and on Harvard


0:58:56
Speaker 0 :campus right so Angie's rominger is a
 good friend of mine and has been for many many years and Andy so originallythere was this beautiful idea that there
 were five string theories and maybe they would be unified into one and we woulddiscover a way to break that symmetries
 of one of those string theories and discover the standard model andpredict all the properties of standard
 model particles like their masses and charges and so forth coupling constantsand then there was a bunch of solutions
 to string theory found which led each of them to a different version of particlephysics with a different phenomenology
 these are called the khalaby Yau manifolds named after Yahoo is also herenot certainly we've been friends at some
 time in the past anyway and then there were nobody was sure but hundreds ofthousands of different versions of
 string theory and then Andy found there was a way to put a certain kind ofmathematical curvature called torsion
 into the solutions and he wrote a paper of string theory with torsion in whichhe discovered there was and not formally
 uncountable but he was unable to invent any way to count the number of solutionsare classified the diverse solutions and
 he wrote that this is worrying because doing phenomenology the old-fashionedway by solving the theory is not going
 to work because there's going to be loads of solutions for everythingproposed phenomenology for anything the
 experiments just go now it hasn't quite worked out that way but nonetheless hetook that worry to me he did he we spoke
 at least once maybe two or three times about that and I got seriously worriedabout that and this is just a little
 it's almost like an anecdote that

1:01:02
Speaker 1 :inspired you're worried about string
 theory in general well I tried to solve

1:01:08
Speaker 0 :the problem and I tried to solve the
 problem I was reading at that time a lot of biology a lot of evolutionary theorylike lynn margulis and Steve Gould and
 so forth and I all right I could take your time to go through things thatoccurred to me maybe physics was like
 evolutionary biology and maybe the laws evolved and there wasthe Baris talked about a landscape a
 fitness landscape of DNA sequences or protein synthesis sequences or a speciesor something like that
 I took their concept and the word landscape from theoretical biology andmade a scenario about how the universe
 as a whole could evolve to discover the parameters of the standard model and I'mhappy to discuss that's called
 cosmological natural selection

1:02:08
Speaker 1 :cosmological natural selection yeah so
 so the parameters of the standard model so it says the laws of physics arechanging it this this idea would say
 that the laws of physics are changing in some way that echoes that of naturalselection or just it adjusts in some way
 towards some goal yes and I published

1:02:29
Speaker 0 :that I wrote the paper in 1880 or 1890
 paper was published in 92 when I first book in 1997 the life of the cosmos wasexplicitly about that and I was very
 clear that what was important is that because you would develop an ensemble ofuniverses but they were related by
 descent through natural selection almost every universe would share the propertythat it was its fitness was maximized to
 some extent were these close to maximum and I could deduce predictions thatcould be tested from that and and I
 worked all of that out and I compared it to the anthropic principle where youweren't able to make tests or make
 falsifications all of this was in the late eighties and early nineties that's

1:03:29
Speaker 1 :a really compelling notion but how does
 that help you arrive I'm coming to

1:03:33
Speaker 0 :whatever where the book came from yes so
 what we've got me I worked on string theory I alsoDon Luhan gravity and I was one of the
 inventors of the quantum gravity and because of my strong belief in someother principles which led to this
 notion of wanting a quantum theory of gravity to be what we call relational orbackground independent I tried very hard
 to make string theory backward independent and ended up developing abunch of tools which then could apply
 directly to general relativity and that became a loop quantum gravity so thethings were very closely related and
 have always been right closely related in my mind the idea that there were twocommunities one devoted to strings and
 one devoted to loops is nuts and this always been nuts okay so so anyway

1:04:29
Speaker 1 :there's this nuts community of loops and
 strings that are all beautiful and compelling and mathematically speakingand what's the trouble with all that why
 is that why is there such a problem so

1:04:42
Speaker 0 :what so I was interested in developing
 that notion of how science works based on a community and ethics that I toldyou about
 and I wrote a draft of a book about that which had several chapters onmethodology of science and it was rather
 academically oriented a book in those chapters were the first part of the bookthe first third of it and you even find
 their remnants in what's now the last chapter last part of the trouble withphysics and then I described a number of
 test cases case studies and one of them which I knew was the search for quantumgravity and string theory and so forth
 and I was unable to get that book published so somebody made thesuggestion of flipping it around and
 starting with a story of string theory which was already controversial this was2004-2005 but I was very careful to be
 detailed to criticize papers and not people you don't you won't find mecriticizing individuals you'll find me
 criticizing certain writing but in any case here'swhat I regret let me make a program with
 y-yes I as far as I know with the exception of not understanding how largethe applications to condensed matter say
 of a DMCA a DSC of T would get I think largely my diagnosis of string theory asit was then has stood up since 2006 what
 I regret is that the same critique I was using string theory as an example andthe same critique applies to many other
 communities in science and all including and this is where I regret my owncommunity that is a community of people
 working on quantum gravity outside string theory but and I consideredsaying that explicitly but I say that
 explicitly since I'm it's a small intimate community I would be tellingstories and naming names of and making a
 kind of history that I have no right to write so I stayed away from that but wasmisunderstood but if I may ask is there


1:07:13
Speaker 1 :a hopeful message for theoretical
 physics that we can take from that book sort of that looks at the community notjust your your own work on now with
 causality and non locality but just broadly in understanding the fundamentalnature of our reality what's your hope
 for the 21st century in physics well do

1:07:37
Speaker 0 :we solve the problem it would solve the


1:07:41
Speaker 1 :unfinished problem of my science this is


1:07:44
Speaker 0 :that's certainly the the thing that I
 care about most in hopefully let me say one thing among the young people that Iwork with I hear very often and since a
 total disinterest in these arguments that we other scientists have and aninterest in what each other is doing and
 this is starting to appear in conferences where the young peopleinterested in quantum gravity make a
 conference may invite loops and strings and causal dynamical triangulations andcausal set people and we're having a
 conference like this next week a small workshop at perimeter and I guess I'madvertising this and then in the summer
 we're having a big full-on conference which is just quantum gravity it's notstrings it's not loops but the
 organizers and the speakers will be from all the different communities yes andthis to me is very helpful that the


1:08:46
Speaker 1 :different ideas are coming together at


1:08:49
Speaker 0 :least people are expressing an interest
 in that there's a huge honor talking to
