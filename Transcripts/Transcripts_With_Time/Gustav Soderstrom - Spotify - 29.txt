0:00:00
Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with


0:00:01
Speaker 0 :Gustav Sorum he's the chief research and


0:00:03
Speaker 1 :development officer Spotify leading
 their product design data technology and

0:00:10
Speaker 0 :engineering teams as I've said before in
 my research and in life in general I love music listening to it and creating

0:00:19
Speaker 1 :it and using technology especially


0:00:20
Speaker 0 :personalization through machine learning
 to enrich the music discovery and

0:00:24
Speaker 1 :

0:00:26
Speaker 0 :listening experience that is what
 Spotify has been doing for years continually innovating defining how we

0:00:31
Speaker 1 :experience music as a society in the


0:00:33
Speaker 0 :digital age that's what Gustav and I


0:00:36
Speaker 1 :talk about among many other topics


0:00:40
Speaker 0 :including our shared appreciation of the


0:00:42
Speaker 1 :movie true romance in my view one of the
 great movies of all time this is the

0:00:47
Speaker 0 :artificial intelligence podcast if you


0:00:50
Speaker 1 :enjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it
 five stars on iTunes support on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter at

0:00:56
Speaker 0 :lux Friedman spelled Fri D ma n and now
 here's my conversation with Gustav Soros

0:01:06
Speaker 1 :from Spotify has over 50 million songs
 in its catalogue so let me ask the all-important question I feel likeyou're the right person to ask what is
 the definitive greatest song of all time

0:01:20
Speaker 0 :it varies for me personally she can't


0:01:23
Speaker 1 :speak definitively for everyone


0:01:26
Speaker 0 :I wouldn't believe very much in machine
 learning if I did right because everyone

0:01:33
Speaker 1 :had the same taste so for you what is
 you have to pick what is the song

0:01:38
Speaker 0 :alright so it's it's pretty easy for me
 there is this song called you're so cool Hans Zimmer soundtrack to true romanceit was a movie that made a big
 impression on me and it's kind of been following me through my life actuallyhad it play at my wedding I start with
 the organist and help them play it on an organ which was a pretty prettyinteresting experience that is probably


0:02:01
Speaker 1 :my I would say top 3 movie of all time
 yeah it's just an incredible yeah and

0:02:07
Speaker 0 :then it came out during my formative
 years and as I've discovered in music you shapeyour music taste during those years so
 it definitely affected me quite a bit

0:02:17
Speaker 1 :did it affect you in any other kind of


0:02:20
Speaker 0 :way well the movie itself affected me
 back then it was a big part of culture I didn't really adopt any characters fromthe movie about it it was a it was a
 great story of love fantastic actors and and you know really I didn't even knowwho Hans Zimmer was at a time but
 fantastic music and so um that song has followed me and the movie actuallyfollow me throughout my life that was a


0:02:44
Speaker 1 :Quentin Tarantino actually I think
 director director produced that her so it's not stairway to heaven or Bohemian

0:02:52
Speaker 0 :Rhapsody so those are those are great
 they're not my personal favorites but uh but they're I realized that people havedifferent tastes and that's it's a big
 part of what we do well for me I have to

0:03:00
Speaker 1 :stick with stairway to heaven so 35,000
 years ago I looked this up on Wikipedia flute like instruments started beingused in caves as part of hunting rituals
 then primitive cultural gatherings things like that this is the birth ofmusic since then we had a few folks
 Beethoven Elvis Beatles Justin Bieber of course Drake so in your view let'sstart like high level philosophical what
 is the purpose of music on this planet

0:03:34
Speaker 0 :of ours I think music has many different
 purposes I think there's there's certainly a big purpose which is thesame as multiple attainment which is
 ESCA pisum and to be able to live in some sort of other mental state for awhile
 but I also think you have the the opposite of escaping which is to helpyou focus on something you are actually
 doing and so I think people use music as a tool to to tune the brain to theactivities that they are actually doing
 and it's kind of like in one sense maybe it's the rawest signal if you if youthink about the brain that's known that
 works it's maybe the most efficient hack we can do to actually actively tune itinto some state that you want to be you
 can do it in other ways you can tell stories to put people in a certain moodbut music is probably very F
 to get to a certain mood very fast and

0:04:27
Speaker 1 :you know there's uh there's a social
 component historically to music where people listen to music together I wasjust thinking about this that to me you
 mentioned machine learning but to me personally music is a really privatething I'm speaking for myself I listen
 to music like almost nobody knows the kind of things I have in my libraryexcept people who are really close to me
 and they really only know a certain percentage there's like some weird stuffthat I'm almost probably embarrassed but
 by right it's called to give the

0:05:01
Speaker 0 :

0:05:02
Speaker 1 :pleasure everyone I said the guilty
 pleasures yet hopefully they're not too bad but it's just the ice for me it'spersonal do you think of music is
 something that's social or as something that's personal this is a very so I

0:05:15
Speaker 0 :think it's the same it's the same answer
 that you use it for for both we we've thought a lot about this during these 10years at Spotify obviously in one sense
 as you said music is incredibly social you go to concerts and so forth on theother hand it is your your escape and
 everyone has these things are very personal to them so what we've found isthat when it comes to to most people
 claim that they have a friend or two that they are heavily inspired by andthat they listen to so I actually think
 music is very social but in a smaller group setting it's in it's an intimateform of of it's an intimate relationship
 it's not something that you necessarily share broadly now at concerts you canargue you do but then you've gathered a
 lot of people that you have something in common with I think this broadcastsharing on music it's something we tried
 on social networks and so forth but it turns out that people aren't superinterested in is what their friends
 listen to they're interested in understanding if they have something incommon crabs with a friend but not you
 know not just as information right that

0:06:35
Speaker 1 :that that's really interesting
 that was just thinking about this morning listening toSpotify I really have a pretty intimate
 relationship was modified with my playlists right I've had them for manyyears now and they've grown with me
 together there's there's an intimate relationship you have with a library ofmusic you've developed and we'll talk
 about different ways to play with that can you do the impossible task and tryto give a history of music listening
 from your perspective from before the Internet and after the Internet and justkind of everything leading up to
 streaming Spotify I'll try it it could

0:07:18
Speaker 0 :be a 100 year podcast yeah I'll try to
 do a brief version there are some things that that I think are very interestingduring the history of music which is
 that before recorded music you to be able to enjoy music you actually had tobe where the music was produced because
 he couldn't he couldn't record it and time-shifted write creation andconsumption had to happen at the same
 time basically concerts and so you either had to get to the nearest villageto listen to music and while that was
 cumbersome and it severely limited the distribution of music it also had somedifferent qualities which was that the
 Creator could always interact with the audienceit was always live and also there was no
 time cap on the music so I think it's not a coincident that these earlyclassical works they're much longer than
 the three minutes the three minutes came in as a restriction of the first waxdisc that could only contain a three
 minute singsong on one side right so actually the recorded music severelylimited there or could constraint I
 won't say limit I mean constraints often good but it put very hard constraints onthe music format so you kind of said
 like instead of doing these this opus like many tens of minutes or somethingnow you get three and a half minutes
 because then you're out of wax on this disc but in return you get in amazingdistribution you reach will widen right


0:08:41
Speaker 1 :just on that point real quick without
 the mass scale distribution there's a scarcity component where you kind oflook forward
 what we had that it's like the Netflix versus HBO Game of Thrones you like waitfor the event because you can't really
 listen to it see you're like look forward to it and then it's you deriveperhaps more pleasure because it's more
 rare for you to listen to particular piece you think there's value to that

0:09:12
Speaker 0 :scarcity yeah I think that that is
 definitely a thing and there's always this component of if you have somethingin infinite amount so will you value it
 as much probably not humanity is always seeking some is relative so you'realways seeking something you didn't have
 and when you have it you don't appreciate as much I think that'sprobably true but I think that's why
 concerts exist so you can actually have both but I think net if you couldn'tlisten to music in your car driving that
 that'd be worse that cost will be bigger than the benefit of of the anticipation

0:09:47
Speaker 1 :I think that you would have so yep it
 started with live concerts then it's being able to you know the thephonograph invented right you start to


0:09:59
Speaker 0 :be able to record music exactly so then
 then you got this massive distribution that that made it possible to create twothings I think first of all cultural
 phenomenons they probably need distribution to be able to happen but italso opened access to you know for a new
 kind of artists so you started to have these phenomenons like Beatles inhalethis and so forth that would really a
 function of distribution I think obviously of talent and innovation butthere was also taking a component and of
 course the next big innovation that come along was was radio broadcast radio andI think radio is interesting because it
 started not as a music medium and started us as an information medium forfor news and then radio need to define
 something to fill the time wid so that they could honestly play more ads andmake more money and music was free so so
 then you had this massive distribution we could program to people I think thosethings that ecosystem is what created
 the ability for for for hits but it was also very broadcast medium so you wouldtend to get these massive massive hits
 but maybe not such a lot

0:11:06
Speaker 1 :tail in terms of choice of everybody
 listening to the same stuff yeah and as

0:11:11
Speaker 0 :you said I think there are some social
 benefits to that yeah I think for example there is there's a highstatistical chance that if I talk about
 the latest episode of Game of Thrones we have something to talk about yeah juststatistically in the age of individual
 choice maybe some of that goes away so I I do see the value of like you knowshared cultural components but I also
 obviously love personalization and so

0:11:36
Speaker 1 :let's catch us up to the Internet
 so maybe Napster well first of all there's like mp3's exact tape CDs there

0:11:45
Speaker 0 :was a digitalization of music with a CD
 really it was physical distribution but the music became did you don't yeah andso they were files but basically boxed
 software and use the software analogy and then you could start downloadingthese files and I think there are two
 interesting things that happen back to music used to be longer before it wasconstrained by the distribution medium I
 don't think that was a coincidence and then really the only music genre to havedeveloped mostly after music was a file
 again on the Internet is EDM and EDM is often much longer than the traditionalmusic I think I think it's interesting
 to think about the fact that music is no longer constrained in minutes per songor something it's it's a it's a legacy
 of our own distribution technology and you see some of this new music that thatbreaks the format not so much as I would
 have expected actually by now but but it still happens so first of all I don't

0:12:39
Speaker 1 :really know what EDM is electronic dance


0:12:41
Speaker 0 :music yeah right you could say Avicii
 was one of the biggest in this genre so

0:12:47
Speaker 1 :the main constraint is of time something
 like three four or five minute songs

0:12:53
Speaker 0 :songs there were eight minutes ten
 minutes and so forth because the you know it started as a digital productthat you downloaded so you didn't have
 this this constraint anymore so I think it's something really interesting that Idon't think has fully happened yet we're
 kind of jumping ahead a little bit to where we are but I think there's there'stons of formal innovation in music that
 should happen now that couldn't happen when you needed toreally adhere to the distribution
 constraints if you didn't adhere to that you will get no distribution so so jerkfor example
 Icelandic artist she made a full I pad app as an album that's very expensiveyou know even though the App Store has
 great distribution she gets nowhere near the distribution versus staying withinthe 3-minute format so I think now that
 music is fully digital inside these streaming services there is there is theopportunity to change the format again
 and allow creators to be much more creative without limiting their their

0:13:54
Speaker 1 :distribution ability that's interesting
 that you're right it's surprising we don't see that taking advantage moreoften it's almost like the constraints
 of the distribution from the 50s and 60s have molded the culture to where we wantthe five three to five minutes on that
 anything else not just so we want the song as consumers and as artists like Icuz I write a lot of music and I never
 even thought about writing something longer than 10 minutes that's it'sreally interesting that those


0:14:28
Speaker 0 :constraints because all your training
 data has been three minutes right it's

0:14:31
Speaker 1 :right okay so yes digitization of data
 later than mp3s

0:14:37
Speaker 0 :yeah so I think you had this file then
 that was distributed physically but then you had the components of digitaldistribution and then the internet
 happened and there was this vacuum where you had a format that could be digitallyshipped but there was no business model
 and then all these pirate networks happen Napster and in pirate in SwedenPirate Bay which was one of the biggest
 and it you know I think from a consumer point of view which which kind of leadsup to the inception of of Spotify from a
 consumer point of view consumers for the first time had this access model tomusic where they could without kind of
 any marginal costs they could they could try different tracks you could use musicin in new ways there was no marginal
 cost and that was a fantastic consumer experience thatjust all the music ever made I think was
 fantastic but it was all so horrible for artists because there was no businessmodel around it so they didn't make any
 money so the user need almost drove the user interface before there was abusiness model and then there were these
 download stores that allowed you to download files which was a solution butit didn't solve the access problem there
 was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to try one more track and I think that thatheavily limits how you listen to music
 the example always give this you know in Spotify a huge amount of people listento music while they sleep while they go
 to sleep and while they sleep if that costed you $0.99 per three minutes youprobably wouldn't do that and you would
 be much less adventurous if there was a real dollar cost to exploring music sothe access model is interesting in that
 it changes your music behavior you can be you can take much more risk becausethere's no marginal cost to it maybe let


0:16:28
Speaker 1 :me linger on piracy for a second because
 I I find especially coming from Russia piracy is something that's very

0:16:38
Speaker 0 :interesting to me not me of course ever


0:16:38
Speaker 1 :but my friends who partook in piracy of
 music software TV shows sporting events and usually to me what that shows is notthat they're they can actually pay the
 money and they're not trying to save money they're choosing the bestexperience so what to me piracy shows is
 a business opportunity in all these domains and that's where I think you'reright spot if I stepped in is basically
 piracy was is an experience you can explore was fine music you like andactually the interface of piracy isn't
 as horrible because it's I mean it's not

0:17:25
Speaker 0 :metadata yeah that metadata is long
 download times all kinds of stuff and

0:17:30
Speaker 1 :what Spotify does is basically
 first rewards artists and second makes the experience of exploring music muchbetter I mean the same is true I think
 for movies and so on this piracy reveals in the software space for example I'm ahuge user and fan of Adobe products and
 the there was much more incentive to pirate Adobe products before they wentto a monthly subscription plan and now
 all of the sudden that you used to pirate Adobe productsthat I know now actually pay gladly for


0:18:08
Speaker 0 :the monthly subscription I think you're
 right I think it's in it's a sign of an opportunity for product development andthat sometimes the there's a product
 market fit before there's a business model fit in product development I thinkthat that is that's a sign of it in in
 Sweden I think was a bit of both there was there was a culture where even had apolitical party called the pirate party
 and this was during the time when when people said that you know informationshould be free it's not was somehow
 wrong to charge for ones and zeros so I think people felt that artists shouldprobably make some money somehow else
 and you know concerts or something so at least in Sweden it was part reallysocial acceptance even at the political
 level and that but that also forced Spotify to compete with with free whichwhich I don't think would actually could
 have happen anywhere else in the world the music industry needed to be doingbad enough to take that risk
 and Sweden was like a perfect testing ground it had government-fundedhigh-bandwidth low-latency broadband
 which meant that the product would work and it was also there was no musicrevenue anyway so they were kind of like
 I don't think this is going to work but why notso this product is one that I don't
 think could have happened in America there was large music market for example

0:19:25
Speaker 1 :so how do you compete with free because
 that's an interesting world of the Internet where most people don't like topay for things so Spotify steps in and
 tries to yes compete with free how do

0:19:39
Speaker 0 :you do it so I think two things one is
 people are starting to pay for things on the InternetI think one way to think about it was
 that advertising was the first business model because no one would put a creditcard on internet transactional with
 Amazon was the second and maybe subscription is their third and if youlook offline subscription is the biggest
 those so that may still happen I think people are starting to pay butdefinitely back then we needed to
 compete with free and the first thing you need to do is obviously to lower theprice to free and then you need to be
 better somehow and the way that Spotify was better was on the user experience onthe on the actual performance the
 latency of you know even if even if you had high bandwidth broadband it wouldstill take you thirty Seconds to a
 minute to download one of these tracks so the Spotify experience of startingwithin the perceptual limit of immediacy
 about 250 milliseconds meant that the the whole trick was that felt as if youhad downloaded all the part that it was
 on your harddrive it was that fast even though it wasn't and it was still freebut somehow you were actually still
 being a legal citizen now that was the trick that's what if I managed to to

0:20:54
Speaker 1 :pull off so yeah I've actually heard you
 say this to write this and that was surprised that wasn't aware of itbecause I just took it for granted you
 know whenever an awesome thing comes along you just like of course it has tobe this way that that's exactly right
 that it felt like the entire world's libraries at my fingertips because ofthat of that latency being reduced what
 was the technical challenge in reducing

0:21:19
Speaker 0 :Olli so there was a group of really
 really talented engineers one of them called Ludwig freakiest he wrote theactually from Gothenburg he wrote the
 initial the uterine client which is kind of an interesting backstory to Spotifyyou know that we have one of the top
 developers from from BitTorrent clients as well so he wrote utorrent the world'ssmallest BitTorrent clients and then he
 he was acquired very early by daniel and martin who found it spotify and theyactually sold the u torrent client to
 BitTorrent but kept living so Spotify had a lot of experience withinpeer-to-peer networking so the original
 innovation wasn't was a distribution innovation where Spotify built anend-to-end media distribution system up
 until only a few years ago we actually hosted all the music ourselves so we hadboth the server side in the cloud
 and that meant that we could do things such as having a peer-to-peer solutionto use local caching on the client-side
 because back then the world was mostly desktop but we could also do things likehack the TCP protocols
 things like niggles algorithm for kind of exponential back-off or ramp up andjust go full throttle and optimize for
 latency at the cost of bandwidth and all of this end-to-end controlmeant that we could do an experience
 that felt like a step change these days we actually are on on GCP we don't hostour own stuff and everyone is really
 fast these days so that was the initial competitive advantage but then obviouslyyou have to move on over time and that


0:22:53
Speaker 1 :was I was over 10 years ago right that


0:22:56
Speaker 0 :was in 2008 the product was launched in
 Sweden it was in a beta I think 2007 and

0:23:01
Speaker 1 :it was on the desktop right so his
 desktop only there's no phone there was

0:23:04
Speaker 0 :no phone the iPhone came out in 2008 but
 the App Store came out one year later I think so the writing was on the wall but

0:23:14
Speaker 1 :there was no phone yet you've mentioned
 that people would use Spotify to discover the songs they liked and thenthey would torrent those songs just so
 they can copy it to their phone just hilarious because I'm not torrent quietit seriously piracy does seem to be and
 like a good guide for business models video content as far as I know Spotify

0:23:40
Speaker 0 :doesn't have video content well we do
 have music videos and we do have videos on the on the service but the way wethink about ourselves is that we're an
 audio service and we think that if you look at the amount of time that peoplespend on audio it's actually very
 similar to the amount of time that's people spend on video so the opportunityshould be equally big but today is not
 at all valued videos value much higher so we think it's basically completelyundervalues we think of ourselves as an
 audio service but within that audio service I think video can make a lot ofsense I think for when you're when
 you're discovering an artist you probably do want to see them andunderstand who they are to understand
 their identity you won't see the video every time now 90% of the time the phoneis gonna be in your pocket
 for podcasters you use video I think that can make a ton of sense so we dohave video but we're an audio service
 where think of it as we call it internally background able video videothat is helpful but isn't isn't the
 driver of the narrative I think also if

0:24:39
Speaker 1 :we look at YouTube the way people
 there's quite a few folks who listen to music on YouTubeso in some sense YouTube was a bit of a
 competitor to to Spotify which is very strange to me that people use YouTube tolisten to music they play essentially
 the music videos right but don't watch the videos and put it in their pocket

0:25:03
Speaker 0 :well I think I think it's similar to to
 what strange I mean it's similar to what we were for the piracy networks knowwhere YouTube for historical reasons
 have a lot of music videos so you use people use YouTube for a lot of thediscovery part of the process I think
 but then it's not a really good sort of quote unquote mp3 player because itdoesn't even background then you have to
 keep the app in the foreground so so the consumption on a good consumption toolbut it's a decently good discoveries I
 mean I think YouTube is fantastic products and I use it for all kinds of

0:25:40
Speaker 1 :purposes so if I were to admit something
 I do use YouTube a little bit for the discovery to assistant discovery processof songs and then if I like it I'll add
 it just fine that's okay that's okay

0:25:50
Speaker 0 :

0:25:52
Speaker 1 :with that ok so sorry we're jumping
 around a little bit so the it's kind of incredible you look at Napster you lookat the early days of Spotify how do you
 one fascinating points how do you grow a user base see their ins in Sweden youhave an idea I saw the initial sketches
 that look terrible how do you grow user base from all from a few folks to

0:26:18
Speaker 0 :millions I think there are a bunch of
 tactical answers so first of all I think you need a great product I don't thinkyou take a bad product and and market it
 to be successful so you need a great

0:26:30
Speaker 1 :product but sorry to interrupt but it's
 a totally new way to listen to music too so it's not just did people realizeimmediately that Spotify is a great
 product

0:26:38
Speaker 0 :I think they did so back to the point of
 pyrazine it was a totally new way to listen to music illegally but people hadbeen used to the access model in Sweden
 and the rest of the world for a long time through piracy so one way to thinkabout Spotify it was just legal and fast
 piracy yeah and so people have been using it for a long time so they weren'talien to it they didn't really
 understand how it could be legal because it was seemed too fast and too good tobe true yeah which i think is a great
 product proposition if you can be too good to be true but what I saw again andagain was people showing each other
 clicking the song showing how fast it started and saying I can't believe thisyeah so I really think it was about
 speed then we also had an invite product program that was there was really meantfor scaling because we hosted our own
 service we needed as a control scaling but that built a lot of expectation andI don't want to say hype because I hype
 implies that it was that it wasn't true excitement around the product and we'vereplicated that when we launched in the
 in the US we also built up and it might only program first there are lots oftactics but I think you need a you need
 a great product that solves some problem and B basically the key innovation therewas technology but on a method level the
 innovation was really the access model versus the ownership model and that wastricky a lot of people said that they I
 mean they wanted to own their music they would never kind of rent it or borrow itbut I think the fact that we had a free
 tier which meant that you get to keep this music for life as wellhelped quite a lot so this is an


0:28:14
Speaker 1 :interesting psychological point maybe
 you can speak to it was a big shift for me like I get to it's almost like a I goto therapy for this is uh I think I
 would describe my early listening experience and I think a lot of myfriends do is basically hoarding music
 is your like slowly one song by one song or maybe albums gathering a collectionof music that you love and you own it
 it's like awful especially with CDs or tape you like physically had it and andwhat Spotify what I had to come to grips
 with it was kind of liberating actually is to throw away all the music I've had

0:28:54
Speaker 0 :this therapy session yes people and I
 think the mental trick is so actually we seen the user data once what if Istarted a lot of people did the exact
 same thing they started hoarding as if the music would disappear right almostthe equivalent of downloading and so you
 know we had these playlists that had limits of like a few hundred thousandtracks which we no one will ever like
 well they do needs and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tracks and tothis day you know some people want to
 actually save code and coordinate play the entire catalog but I think that thetherapy session goes something like
 instead of throwing away your music if you took your files and you store themin the locker at Google it'd be a
 streaming service it's just that in that locker you have all the world's musicnow for free so instead of giving away
 your music you got all the music it's yours it's a you could think of it athaving a copy of the world's catalogue
 that forever so you actually got more music instead of less it's just that youjust took that hard disk and you sent it
 to to someone who stored it for you and once you go through that mental journeyI'm like still my files they're just
 over there and I just have 40 million other 50 million or something now thenpeople are like okay that's good
 the problem is I think because you paid us a subscription if we hadn't had thefree tier where you would feel like even
 if I don't want to pay anymore I still get to keep them you keep your playlistforever they don't disappear even though
 you stopped paying I think that was really important if we would havestarted us you know you can put in all
 this time but if you stopped paying you lose all your work I think that wouldhave been a big challenge and what's the
 big challenge for a lot of our competitors that's another reason why Ithink the free tier is really important
 that people need to feel the security that the work they put in it will neverdisappear even if they decide not to pay


0:30:42
Speaker 1 :I like how you put the work you put in I
 she stopped even think of it that way I just actually Spotify taught me to justenjoy music I'm sorry as opposed as
 opposed to what I was doing before which is like in an unhealthy way hoardingmusic which I found that because I was
 doing that I was listening to a small selection of songs way too much to ourwhere I was getting sick of them whereas
 Spotify the more liberating kind of approaches I was just enjoying of courseI listened to stairway to heaven over
 and over but because of the extra variety I don't get as sick of themthere is an interesting statistic I saw
 that so Spotify has maybe you can correct me butover 50 million songs tracks and over
 three billion playlists so yes a million songs and three billion playlists 60times more playlists what do you make of


0:31:39
Speaker 0 :that yeah so the way I think about it is
 that from a from is that the station or machine learning point of view you haveall these if you only thing about
 reinforcement learning where you have this state space of all the tracks andyou can take different journeys through
 this through this world and these I think of these is like people helpingthemselves and each other creating
 interesting vectors through this space of tracks and then it's not sosurprising that across you know many
 tens of millions of kind of atomic units there will be billions of paths thatmake sense and we're probably pretty
 quite far away from having found all of them so kind of our job now is userswhen Spotify started it was really a
 search box that was for that time pretty powerful and then I'd like to refer tothat this programming language called
 play listing where if you as you probably were pretty good at musicyou knew your new releases you knew your
 backyard law you knew your stairway to heaven you could create a soundtrack foryourself using this playlist thing - oh
 that's like meta programming language for music - sounds like your life andpeople who were good at music it's back
 to how do you scale the product for people who are good at music that wasn'tactually enough if you had the catalog
 in a good search tool and you can create your own sessions you could createreally good a soundtrack for your entire
 life probably perfectly personalized because you did it yourself but theproblem was most people many people
 aren't that good at music they just can't spend the time even if you're verygood at news it's gonna be hard to keep
 up so what we did to try to scale this was to essentially try to build you canthink of them as a
 instead there's this friend that some people had that helped them navigatethis music catalog that's what we're


0:33:26
Speaker 1 :trying to do for you but also there is
 something like 200 million active users on Spotify so there it's okay so fromthe machine learning perspective you
 have these 200 million people plus they're creating it's really interestingto think of playlist as I mean I don't
 know if you meant it that way but it's almost like a programming language it'sa released a trace of exploration of
 those individual agents of the the listeners and you have all this newtracks coming in so it's a fascinating
 space that is ripe for machine learning so that is there is it is it possiblehow can playlist be used as data in
 terms of machine learning and just to

0:34:24
Speaker 0 :help Spotify organize the music so we
 found in our data not surprising that people who play listed lots they retainmuch better they had a great experience
 and so our first attempt was to playlist for users and so we acquired thiscompany called tune ego of editors and
 professional playlist errs and kind of leverage the maximum of humanintelligence to help to help build kind
 of these vectors through the track space for four people and that that broadenthe product then the obvious next and we
 you know use statistical means where they could see what when they created aplaylist how did that play this perform
 you know they could see skips of the songs they could see how the songsperform and they manually iterated the
 playlist to maximize performance for a large group of people but there werenever enough editors to playlist for you
 personally so the promise of machine learning was to go from kind of grouppersonalization using editors and tools
 into statistics to individualization and then what's so interesting about the 3billion playlist we have is we ended the
 truth is we lucked out this was not a priori strategy as is often the caseit looks really smart in hindsight was
 as dumb luck we looked at these playlists and we had some people in thecompany a person named their grandson it
 was really good at machine learning already back in in back then in like2007-2008 back then it was mostly
 collaborative filtering you so forth but we realized that what what this is ispeople are grouping tracks for
 themselves that have some semantic meaning to them and then they actuallylabel it with a playlist name as well so
 in a sense people were grouping tracks along semantic dimensions and labelingthem and so could you could you use that
 information to find that that latent embedding and so we started playingaround with collaborative filtering and
 we saw tremendous success with it basically trying to extract some ofthese some of these dimensions and and
 if you think about it's not surprising at all it'd be quite surprising ifplaylists were actually random if they
 had no semantic meaning for most people they group these tracks for some reasonso we just happen to cross this
 incredible data set where people are taking taken these tens of millions oftracks and group them along different
 semantic vectors and the semantics being

0:36:52
Speaker 1 :outside the individual users it's some
 kind of universal there's a universal embedding that holds across people on

0:37:02
Speaker 0 :this earth yes I do think that the
 embeddings you finally gonna be reflective of the people who play listedso if if you have a lot of indie lovers
 who playlist your embed is going to perform better there but what we foundwas that yes there were these these
 latent similarities they were very powerful and we we had them it wasinteresting because I think that the
 people who play listed the most initially were this so-called musicaficionados who who really into music
 and they often had a certain they're tasteful stuff is often certain gearedtowards a certain type of music and so
 what surprised us if you look at the problem from the outside you mightexpect that
 the algorithms would start performing best with mainstreamers first because itsomehow feels like an easier problem to
 solve mainstream tastes than really particular tastes it was the completeopposite for us the recommendations
 performed fantastically for people who saw themselves as having very uniquetaste that's probably because all of
 them playlist ed and they didn't perform so well for mainstream is they actuallythought they were a bit too particular
 and unorthodox so we had the complete opposite of what we expected successwithin the hardest problem first and
 then had to try to scale to more mainstream recommendations so you've

0:38:18
Speaker 1 :also acquired echo nests that analyze a
 song data so in your view maybe you can talk about so what kind of data is therefrom a machine learning perspective
 there's a like a huge amount what we're talking about playlists thing and justuser data of what people are listening
 to the playlists are constructing and so on and then there's the the actual datawithin a song what makes a song I don't
 know the actual waveforms right is there any how do you mix the two how muchvalues are in each to me it seems like
 user data is well it's a romantic notion that the song itself would containuseful information but if I were to
 guess user data would be much more powerful like playlists would be much

0:39:11
Speaker 0 :more powerful yeah so we use both our
 biggest success initially what was with playlist data without understandinganything about the structure of this
 song but when we acquire the echo nest they had the inverse problem theyactually didn't have any play data they
 were just they were a provider of recommendations but they didn't actuallyhave any play data so they they looked
 at the structure of songs sonically and they looked at Wikipedia for culturalreferences and so forth right cool and
 did a lot of NLU and so forth so we got that skill into the company and combinekind of our user data with their with
 their kind of content-based so you can think of as we were used to based andthey were content based in their
 recommendations and we combine those two and for some cases where you have a newthere's no no play date obviously you
 have to try to go by either you know who the artist is or or the sonicinformation in the song or what it's
 similar to so there's definitely value in in both and we do a lot in both but Iwould say yes the user data captures
 things that that have to do with culture in the greater society that you wouldnever see in the in the content itself
 but that said we have seen we have a research lab in Paris when you know wecan talk about more about that on kind
 of machine layer on the creator side what it can do for creators not just forthe consumers but where we looked at how
 does the structure of a song actually affect the listening behavior and itturns out that there is a lot of we can
 we can predict things like skips based on we you know based on on the songitself we could say that maybe you
 should move that chorus a bit because you're skippers gonna go up here thereis a lot of latent structure in the
 music which is not surprising because it is some sort of mind hack so thereshould be structured that's probably
 what we respond to you just blew my mind

0:41:01
Speaker 1 :actually for from the creator
 perspective so that's really interesting topic that probably most creators aren'ttaking advantage of right so there's
 I've recently got to interact with a few folks youtubers who are like obsessedwith this idea of what do I do to make
 sure people keep watching the video and then like look at the analytics of whichpoint if people turn off and so on first
 of all don't think that's healthy but it's it's because you can do it a littletoo much but it is a really powerful
 tool for helping the creative process you just made me realize you could dothe same thing for creation of music and
 so is that something you've looked into oh is it can you speak to how muchopportunity there is for that yeah I


0:41:55
Speaker 0 :think I listen to to the podcast with
 Suraj yeah and I thought it was fantastic and directed to do the samething where he said and he said he
 posted something in the morning yeah immediately watch the feedbackwhere the drop off was and then
 responded to that in the afternoon yeah which which is quite different fromhow people make podcasts for example yes
 exactly I mean the feedback loop is almost non-existent it's very so if weback out a one-level I think actually
 both for music and podcasts which we also do is let Spotify I think there's atremendous opportunity just for the
 creation workflow and I think it's really interesting speaking to you whobecause you're a musician a developer
 and a podcaster if you think about those three different roles if you if you makethe leap as a musician if you if you
 think about it as a software tool chain really your door with the stemsthat's the IDE right that's what you
 work in source code formant with your with with what you're creating then yousit around and you play with that and
 when you're happy you compile that thing into some sort of you know AAC or mp3 orsomething you do that because you get
 distribution there's so many runtimes for that mp3 across the world andCarstairs and stuff so you kind of
 compile this executable you ship it out and kind of an old fashioned boxsoftware analogy and then you hope for
 the best right right but as a as a as a software developer you'd never do thatfirst you go and get helping you
 collaborate with other Creators yeah and then you know you think it'd be crazy tojust ship one version of your software
 without doing an a/b test without any feedback loop and then HD tracking

0:43:30
Speaker 1 :

0:43:31
Speaker 0 :exactly and then you would you would
 look at the feedback loops and try to optimize that thing right so I think ifyou think of it as a as a very specific
 software tool chain it looks quite arcane you know the tools that a musiccreator has versus what a software
 developer has so that's kind of how we think about it and why wouldn't a whywouldn't a music creator have something
 like github you could collaborate much more easily so we have we bought thiscompany called sound trap which has a
 kind of Google Docs for music approach where you can collaborate with otherpeople on the kind of source code format
 with stamps and I think introducing things like AI tools there to help youas you're creating music both in in
 helping you you know put accompaniment your music like drumsor something help you master and mix
 automatically help you understand how this track will perform exactly what youwould expect as a software developer I
 think makes a lot of sense and I think the same goes for a podcaster I thinkpodcasters will expect to have the same
 kind of feedback loop that Siraj has like why wouldn't you maybe maybe it'snot healthy but sorry I wanted to


0:44:44
Speaker 1 :criticize the fact cuz you can overdo it
 because a lot of the each and we're in a new era of that so you can becomeaddicted to it and therefore what people
 say you become a slave to the YouTube algorithm are sort of it's a it's alwaysa danger of a new technology as opposed
 to say if you're creating a song becoming too obsessed about the introriff to the song that keeps people
 listening versus actually the entirety of the creation process it's a balanceabsolutely but the fact that there's
 zero I mean you're blowing my mind right now because you're completely right thatthere is no signal whatsoever there's no
 feedback whatsoever in the creation process and music or podcasting almostat all and are you saying that Spotify
 is hoping to help create tools to not

0:45:43
Speaker 0 :tools but no tools actually actually


0:45:45
Speaker 1 :

0:45:46
Speaker 0 :tools from traders absolutely so we have
 we've remains micro stations the last few years around music creation thiscompany called soundtrap which is the
 door digital audio workstation but that is browser-based and that their focuswas really the Google Docs approach
 where you can collaborate with people much more easily then you could inprevious tools so we have some of these
 tools that we're working with that we want to make accessible and then we canconnect it with our with our consumption
 data we can create this feedback loop where we could help you understand wecould help you create and help you
 understand how you will perform we also acquired this other company withinpodcasting called anchor which is one of
 the biggest podcasting tools mobile focused so really focused on simplecreation or easy access to create
 but that also gives us this feedback loop and even before that we invested insomething called Spotify for artists and
 Spotify for podcasters which is an app that you can download you can verifythat you are that creator and then you
 get you get things that you know software developers have had for yearsyou can see where if you look at your
 podcast for example on Spotify or or a song that you released you can see howit's performing which cities is
 performing and who is listening to it what's the demographic break up sosimilar in the sense that you can
 understand how you're actually doing on the on the platform so we we definitelywant to build tools I think you also
 interviewed the head of research for Adobe and I think that's an item back tophotoshop that you like I think that's
 an interesting analogy as well Photoshop I think has been very innovative inhelping photographers and artists and I
 think there should be the same kind of tools for for music creators where youcould get you know AI assistants for
 example that's you creating music as you can do with with Adobe where you can Iwant to sky over here and you can get
 help creating that sky the really

0:47:43
Speaker 1 :fascinating thing is what Adobe doesn't
 have is a distribution for the content you create so you don't have the data ofif I create if I uh you know whatever
 creation I'm making Photoshop a premiere I can't get like immediate feedback likeI can on YouTube for example about the
 way people are responding and if Spotify is creating those tools that that's areally exciting actually world but let's
 talk a little about podcast it's so I have trouble talking to one person soit's a bit terrifying and kind of hard
 to fathom but an average sixty to a hundred thousand people will listen tothis episode okay so it's intimidating
 it's intimidating so I hosted on blueberry I don't know ifI'm pronouncing that correctly actually
 it looks like most people listen to an Apple podcast cashbox and pocket gasand only about a thousand listen on
 Spotify in just my podcast right so

0:48:54
Speaker 0 :

0:48:56
Speaker 1 :where do you see a time when Spotify
 will dominate this so Spotify is relatively new into this podcasting talknesting site yeah in podcasting what's
 the deal with podcasting and Spotify how serious is Spotify about podcasting doyou see a time where everybody would
 listen to you know probably a huge amount of people majority perhaps listento music on Spotify do you see a time
 when the same is true for podcasting

0:49:26
Speaker 0 :well I certainly hope so
 that is our mission our mission as a company is actually to enable a millioncreators to live off of their art in a
 billion people inspired by it and what I think it is interesting about thatmission is it actually puts the crater's
 first even though it's not as a consumer focused company and it says to be ableto live off of their art not just make
 some money or further art as well so it's quite an ambitious project and sowe think about creators of all kinds and
 we kind of expanded our mission from being music - being audio a while backand that's not so much because we think
 we made that decision we think that my decision was was made for uswe need the world made that decision
 whether we like it or not when you put in your headphones you're gonna make achoice between music and new episode of
 of your podcast or something else right we're in that world whether we like itor not
 and that you know that's how radio work so we decided that we think it's aboutaudio you can see the rise of audiobooks
 and so forth we think audio is this great opportunity so we decided to enterit and and obviously Apple and Apple
 podcast is absolutely dominating in podcasting and we didn't have a singlepodcast only like two years ago
 what we did though was we we we looked at this and said no can we bringsomething to this you know we want to do
 this but the back to the Josefa we have to do something thatconsumers actually value to be able to
 do this and the reason we've gone from not existing at all to being the therecord of what quite a wide margin the
 second-largest podcast consumption still still wide gap to iTunes but we'regrowing quite fast I think it's because
 when we when we looked at the consumer problempeople said surprisingly that they
 wanted their podcasts and music in the same in the same application so what wedid was we took a little bit of a
 different approach what we said instead of building a separate podcast app wethought it's their consumer problem to
 solve here because the others are very successful already and we thought therewas in making a more seamless experience
 where you can have your podcast in your music in the same application because wethink it's audio to you and that that
 has been successful and that meant that we actually had 200 million people tooffer this to instead of starting from 0
 so I think we have a good chance because we're taking a different approach thanthe competition and back to the other
 thing I mentioned about creators because we're looking at the end-to-end flow Ithink there's a tremendous amount of
 innovation to do around podcast as a format when we have creation tools andconsumption I think we could start
 improving what podcasting is I mean podcast is this this opaque big like 1/2hour file that you're streaming which it
 really doesn't make that much sense in 2019 that it's not interactive there'sno feedback loops nothing like that so I
 think if we're gonna win it's gonna have to be because we build a better productfor creators and for for consumers so
 we'll see but it's certainly our goal we have a long way to go

0:52:38
Speaker 1 :well the creators part is really
 exciting you ready you got me hooked there is the only stats I have ablueberry just recently added the stats
 of whether it's listened to the end or not and that's like a huge improvementbut that's still nowhere to where you
 could possibly go into her statistics

0:52:58
Speaker 0 :you just download this pot of five
 podcasters up and verify and then then you know where people dropped out in

0:53:04
Speaker 1 :this episode oh wow ok the moment I
 started talking okay I might be depressed by this but okay so one oneother question
 the original Spotify for music and I have a question about podcasting in thisline is the idea of albums I have what
 did you use ik aficionados a friends who are really big fans of music oftenreally enjoy albums listening to entire
 albums of an artist and correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like Spotify hashelped replace the idea of an album with
 playlists so you create your own albums it's kind of the way at least I'veexperienced music and I have really
 enjoy it that way one of the things that was missing in podcasting for me I don'tknow if it's missing I don't know it's
 an open question for me but the way I listen to podcasts is the way I wouldlisten to albums so I take Joe Rogan
 experience and that's an album and I listen you know I like I put that on andI listen one episode after the next and
 there's a sequence and so on is there a room for doing what you did for music ordoing what about if I did for music but
 creating playlists sort of this kind of play listing idea of breaking apart frompodcasting from individual podcasts and
 creating kind of this interplay or Debbie thought about that space it's a

0:54:35
Speaker 0 :great question so I think in in music
 you're right basically you bought an album so it was like you bought a smallcatalog of like 10 tracks right it was
 it was again it was actually a lot of a lot of consumption you think it's aboutwhat you like but it's based on the
 business model right so you paid for this 10 track yeah service and then youlistened to that for a while
 and then when everything was flat priced you tended to listen differently now soso I think the I think the album is
 still tremendously important that's why we have it and you can save albums andso forth and you have a huge amount of
 people who really listen according to albums and I like that because it is acreator format you can tell a longer
 story over several tracks and so some people listen to just one track somepeople actually want to hear that whole
 story now in podcast I think I think it's different you can arguethat podcasts might be more like shows
 on Netflix you have like a full season of of narcos and you're probably notgoing to do like one episode of Marcos
 and then one of house of cards like you know that there's a narrative there andyou you you love the cast and you love
 these chairs so I think people will people love shows and I think they willthey will listen to those shows I do
 think you follow a bunch of shows at the same time so there's certainly anopportunity to bring you the latest
 episode of you know whatever that 5 6 10 things that that you're into but but Ithink I think people are gonna listen to
 specific hosts and love those hosts for a long time because I think there'ssomething different with podcast where
 this format of the the experience of the of the audience is actually sitting hereright between us whereas if you look at
 something on TV the audio actually would come fromyou would sit over there the order would
 come to you from both of us as if you were watching notice you were part ofthe conversation so my experience is I
 mean listen to podcasts like yours and Joe Rogan is I feel like I know all ofthese people they they have no idea who
 I am but I feel like you know so many artists and that it's very differentfrom me watching a watching like a TV
 show or an interview so I think you you kind of fall in love with people andexperience in a different way so I think
 I think shows and hosts are gonna be very very important I don't think that'sgonna go away in just some sort of thing
 where well you don't even know who you're listening to I don't think that'sgonna happen what I do think is I think
 there's a tremendous discovery opportunity in podcast because thecatalog is growing quite quickly and I
 think podcast is only a few like five six hundred thousand shows right now ifyou look back to YouTube as another in
 knowledge of creators no one really knows if you would lift the lid onYouTube but it's probably billions of
 episodes and so I think the podcast catalog would probably grow tremendouslybecause the creation tools are getting
 easier and then you're gonna have this discovery opportunity that I think isreally big so so a lot of people tell me
 that they love their shows but discovering podcasts kind of suckit's really hard to get into new show
 they're usually quite long it's a big time investments I think there's plentyof opportunity in the discovery part


0:57:44
Speaker 1 :yeah for sure a hundred percent in in
 even the dumbest there's so many low-hanging fruit too for example justknowing what episode to listen to first
 to try out a podcast exactly because most podcasts don't have an order tothem they they can be listening to out
 of order and sorry to say some are better than others episodes so someepisodes of Joe Rogan are better than
 others and it's nice to know which you should listen to to try it out andthere's as far as I know almost no
 information in terms of like up votes on how good an episode is exactly so I

0:58:28
Speaker 0 :think part of the problem is you it's
 kind of like music there isn't one answer people use music for differentthings and there's actually many
 different types of music there's workout music and there's classical piano musicand focus music and and and so forth I
 think the same with podcasts some podcasts are sequential they're supposedto be listened to in in order it's
 actually it's actually telling a narrative some podcasts are one topickind of like yours but different guests
 so you could jump in anywhere some potes I have completely different topics andfor those podcasts it might be that I
 want you know we should recommend one episode because it's about AI yeah fromsomeone but then they talk about
 something that you're not interested in the rest of the episodes so I think orwell we're spending a lot of time on now
 it's just first understanding the domain and creating kind of the knowledge graphof how do these objects relate and how
 do people consume and I think we'll find that it's gonna be it's gonna be

0:59:25
Speaker 1 :different I'm excited
 is it your the Spotify is the first people I'm aware of that are trying todo this for podcasting podcasting has
 been like a Wild West

0:59:37
Speaker 0 :up until now it's been a very we want to
 be very careful though because it's been a very good Wild West I think is thisfragile ecosystem
 and I you we want to make sure that you don't barge in and say like oh we'regonna internalize this thing and you
 have to think about the the creators you have to understand how they getdistribution today who listens to how
 they make money today started you know make sure that their business modelworks that they understand the I think
 it's back to doing something improving their products like feedback loops and

1:00:12
Speaker 1 :distribution so jumping back into terms
 of this fascinating world of recommender system and listening to music and usingmachine learning to analyze things do
 you think it's better to what currently correct me if I'm wrong but currentlySpotify lets people pick what they
 listen to the most part there's a discovery process but you kind oforganize playlists is it better to let
 people pick what they listen to or recommend what they should listen tosomething like stations by Spotify that
 I saw that you're playing around with maybe you can tell me what's the statusof that this is a Pandora style app that
 just kind of as opposed to you select the music you listen to it kind of feedsyou music you listen to what's the
 status of stations by Spotify what's its

1:01:05
Speaker 0 :future the store is modify as we have
 grown has been that we made it more accessible to different differentaudiences and stations is another one of
 those where the question is some people want to be very specific they actuallywant to hear stairway to heaven right
 now that needs to be very easy to do andsome people or even the same person at
 some point might say I want to feel up beats or I want to feel happy or I wantsongs to sing in the car alright so they
 put in they put in the information in a very different level and then we need totranslate that into that what that means
 musically so stations is a test to to create like a consumption input vectorthat is much simpler where you can just
 tune in a little bit and see if that increases the overall reach but we'retrying to kind of serve the entire gamut
 of super-advanced so-called music aficionados all the way to to people whothey love listening to music but it's it
 not their number-one priority in life right they're not going to sit andfollow every new release from every new
 artist they need to be able to to influence music at a at a at a differentlevel so we're trying you can think of
 it as different products and I think when one of them one of the interestingthings to answer your question on if
 it's better to lift the user to soar to play I think the answer is the thechallenge when you when machine learning
 kind of came along there was a lot of thinking about what this productdevelopment mean in a machine learning
 context people like Andrew Aang for example when I went to buy do I starteddoing a lot of practical machine
 learning went from academia and you know he thought a lot about this and he hadthis notion that you know product
 manager designer an engine they used to work around this wireframe I kind ofdescribed what the product should look
 like who some talk about when you're doing like a chatbot or a playlist howdo you what are you gonna say like it
 should be good that's not a good product description so how do you how do you dothat he came up with this notion that
 the test set is the new wireframe the the job of the product manager is tosource a good test set that is
 representative of what like if you say like I want to play the status songsmissing in the car job the product
 managers go in source like a good test out of what that means then you can workwith engineering to have algorithms to
 try to produce that right so we try to think a lot about how to structureproduct development for for a machine
 learning age and and what we discovered was that a lot of it is actually in theexpectation and you can go you can go
 two ways so let's say that if you if you set theexpectation with the user that this is a
 discovery product like discover weekly you're actually setting the expectationthat most of all we show you will not be
 relevant when you're in the discovery process you're gonna accept thatactually if you find one gem every
 Monday that you totally love you're probably gonna be happy even though thestatistical meaning one out of ten is
 terrible or one out of twenty is terrible from a user point of viewbecause the studying was discoveries
 fine can I get a sorry to interrupt real

1:04:03
Speaker 1 :quick I just actually learned about
 discover weekly which is a Spotify I don't know it's it's a feature a Spotifythat shows you cool songs to listen I
 maybe I can do issue tracking I couldn't find them my Spotify app it's in your

1:04:20
Speaker 0 :

1:04:21
Speaker 1 :library it's in the library it's in the
 list of life cuz I was like whoa is just cool I didn't know this existed and Itry to find it but I'll show it to you


1:04:28
Speaker 0 :back product yeah but yeah it's a so yes


1:04:31
Speaker 1 :I just uh just to mention the
 expectation there is basically they you're going to discover in your song

1:04:42
Speaker 0 :yes so then you can be quite adventurous
 in in the recommendations you do but but if you're but we have another productcalled daily mix which kind of implies
 that these are only going to be your favorites so if you have one out of tenthat is good and nine out of ten that
 doesn't work for you you're gonna think it's a horrible product so actually alot of the product development we
 learned over the years it's about setting the right expectation so fordaily mix you know algorithmically we
 would pick among things that feel very safe in your taste space there'sdiscover weekly we go kind of well
 because the expectation is most of this is not gonna so a lot of that a lot oftimes of your question there a lot of
 should you let the user pick or not it depends we have some products where thewhole point is that the user can click
 play put the phone in the pocket and it should be really good music for like anhour we have other products where you
 probably need to say like no no say no no and it's very interactive I see thatmakes sense and then the radio product
 the station's product is one of these like click Play put in your pocket fourhours that's really interesting so


1:05:43
Speaker 1 :you're thinking of different test sets
 for differ users interact create products that sortof optimize optimize for those test sets
 that represents a specific set of users

1:05:58
Speaker 0 :yes I think one thing that I think is
 interesting is we we invested quite heavily in editorial in in peoplecreating playlists using a statistical
 data and I was successful for us and then we also invested in in machinelearning and for the longest time you
 know within Spotify and within the rest of the industry there was always thisnarrative of humans versus the machine
 how go versus editorial and an editors would would say like well if I had thatdata if I could see your playlist in
 history and I made a choice for you I would have made a better choice and theywould have because they honest they're
 much smarter than these algorithms the human is incredibly smart compared toour algorithms they can take culture
 into account and so forth the problem is that they can't make 200 milliondecisions you know per hour for every
 user that logs in so the algo may be not as sophisticated but much more efficientso there was this there was this
 contradiction but then a few years ago we started focusing on this kind ofhuman-in-the-loop thinking around
 machine learning and we actually coined an internal term for it called algotoriel combination of algorithms and and
 editors where if we take a concrete example you think of the editor there'sthis paid expert that we have there's
 really good at something like so hip-hop EDM something right there a true expertno and one in the industry so they have
 all the cultural knowledge you think of them as the product manager and you saythat let's say that you want to create a
 you think that there's a there's a product need in the world for somethinglike songs to sing in the car or someone
 sitting in the shower and I'm taking that example because it exists peoplelove yeah The Scream songs in the car
 when they drive right yeah so you want to create that product and you have thisproduct manager if it's a musical expert
 they create they come up with a concept like I think this is a missing thing inin humanity like upside it's called song
 sitting in the car they they create the framing the image the title and theycreate a test set or they create a group
 of songs like a few thousand songs out of the catalogue that they manuallycurate that our known songs that are
 great to sing in the car and they can take like to romance into account theyunderstand things that our algorithms do
 not at all so they have this huge set of tracks then when we deliver that to youwe look at your taste vectors and you
 get the 20 tracks that are songs to sing in the car in your taste so you have youhave personalization and editorial input
 in the same process if that makes sense

1:08:30
Speaker 1 :yeah it makes total sense and I have
 several questions around that this is a this is like fascinating okay so firstit is a little bit surprising to me that
 the world expert humans are outperforming machines at specifyingsongs to sing in the car so maybe you
 could talk to that a little bit I don't know if you can put it into words butwhat is it how difficult is this problem
 of tea do you really I guess what I'm trying to ask is there how difficult isit to encode the cultural references the
 the context of the song the artists all those things together can machinelearning really not do that I mean I


1:09:17
Speaker 0 :think machine learning is great at
 replicating patterns if you have the patterns but if you try to write with mea spec of what songs greatest song
 testing in the card definition is is it is it loud there's many chorusesshould've been in movies it's it quickly
 gets incredibly complicated right yeah and and a lot of it may not be in thestructure of the song or the title it
 could be cultural references because you know it was a history once so so thedefinition problems quickly get and I
 think that was the that was the insight of Andrew Aang when he said the job ofthe product manager is to understand
 these things that that algorithms don't and then define what that looks like andthen you have something to train towards
 right then you have kind of the test set and then so so today the editors createthis pool of tracks and then we
 personalize you could easily imagine that once you have this set you couldhave some automatic exploration on the
 rest of the catalogue because then you understand what it is and then the other

1:10:14
Speaker 1 :side of it what machine learning
 does help is this taste vector how hard is it to construct a vector thatrepresents the things an individual
 human likes it this human preference so you can you know music isn't like it'snot like Amazon like things you usually
 buy music seems more amorphous like it's this thing that's hard to specify likewhat what is what you know if you look
 at my playlist what is the music that I love it's harder it seems to be muchmore difficult to specify concretely so
 how hard is it to a build the taste

1:10:56
Speaker 0 :vector it is very hard in the sense that
 you need a lot of data and I think what we found was that so it's not so it'snot a stationery problem most it changes
 over time and so we've gone through the journey of if you've done a lot ofcomputer vision obviously I've done a
 bunch of computer vision in my past and and we started kind of with thehandcrafted heuristics for you know this
 is kind of in the music this is this and if you consume this you probably likethis so we have we started there and we
 have some of that still then what was interesting about the playlist data wasthat you could find these latent things
 that wouldn't necessarily even make sense to you that could could evencapture maybe cultural references
 because they Co occurred things that they wouldn't have appearedmechanistically either in the content or
 so forth so I think that I think the core assumption is that there arepatterns in in almost everything and if
 there are patterns these these embedding techniques are getting better and betternow if now as everyone else we're also
 using kind of deep embedding so you can encode binary values and so forth andwhat I think is interesting is is this
 process to try to find things that they do not necessarily you wouldn't actuallyhave have guessed so it is very hard in
 a in an engineering sense to find the dimensions it's an incrediblescalability problem to do for hundreds
 of millions of users and to update it every day but in but in theory in theoryembeddings isn't that complicated the
 fact that you try to find some principal components or some like thatdimensionality reduction is also the
 theory I guess is easy that the practices is very very hard and it's ait's a huge engineering challenge but
 fortunately we have some amazing research and engineering teams in this

1:13:01
Speaker 1 :space yeah I guess the the question is
 all I mean it's similar I deal with it with an autonomous vehicle spaces thequestion is how hard is driving and here
 is basically the question is of edge cases so embedding probably works notprobably but I would imagine works well
 in a lot of cases so there's a bunch of questions that arise then so do songpreferences does your taste vector
 depend on context like mood right so there's different moods and absolutelyso how does that take in is it is it
 possible to take that at consideration or do you just leave that as a interfaceproblem that allows the user to just
 control it so when I'm looking for workout music I kind of specify it bychoosing certain players doing certain


1:14:01
Speaker 0 :search yeah so that's a great point it's
 back to the product development you could try to spend a few years trying topredict which mood you're in
 automatically open Spotify or you create a tab which is happy and sad right andyou're gonna be right 100% of the time
 with one click now it's probably much better to let the user tell you ifthey're happy or sad or if they want to
 work out on the other hand if you use the interface become 2,000 tabs you'reintroducing so much friction so no one
 will use the product so then you have to get better so it's this thing where Ithink it maybe was I remember who coined
 it but it's called fault tolerant you is right you build the UI that is tolerantof being wrong and then you can be much
 less right in your you know in your algorithmsso we you know we've had to learn a lot
 of that building the right UI that fits where the where the machine learning isand and a great discovery there which is
 which was by the teams during one of our hack days was this thing of takingdiscovery packaging it into a playlist
 and saying that these are new tracks that we think you might like based onthis and studying the right expectation
 made it made it a great product so I think we have this benefit that forexample Tesla doesn't have that we can
 we can we can change the expectation we can we can build a fault-tolerantsetting it's very hard to be fault
 tolerant when you're driving at you know 100 miles per hour or something and andwe we have the luxury of being able to
 say that of being wrong if we have the right UI which gives us differentabilities to take more risk so I
 actually think the self-driving problem is is much harder oh yeah for sure

1:15:38
Speaker 1 :it's much less fun because people die
 exactly and in Spotify it's just such a more fun problem because failure willmean failures beautiful away at least
 exploration so it's a really fun reinforcement learning project the worst

1:15:58
Speaker 0 :case scenario is to get these WTF tweets
 like how did I get this this song which is a lot better than the self-driving

1:16:06
Speaker 1 :favor so what's the feedback that a user
 puts the signal that a user provides into the system so the the you mentionedskipping what is like the strongest
 signal is uh you didn't mention clicking

1:16:24
Speaker 0 :like so so we have a few signals that
 are important obviously playing playing through so so one of the benefits ofmusic actually even compared to podcast
 or or movies is the object itself is really only about three minutes so youget a lot of chances to recommend and
 the feedback loop is is every three minutes instead of every two hours orsome things you actually get kind of
 noisy but but quite fast feedback and so you can see if people played through orif they which is you know the inverse of
 skip really that an important signal on the other handmuch of the consumption happens when
 your phone is in your pocket maybe you're running or driving or you'replaying on a speaker and so you not
 skipping doesn't mean that you love that song it might be that it wasn't badenough that you would walk up and skip
 so it's a noisy signal then then we have the equivalent of the like which is yousaved it to your library that's a pretty
 strong signal of affection and then we have the more explicit signal of playlisting like you took the time to create
 a playlist you put it in there there's a very little small chance that if youtook all that trouble this is not a
 really important track to you and then we understand also what are the tracksit relates to so we have we have the
 playlist thing we have the like and then we have the listening or skipped and youhave two very different approaches to
 all of them because at different levels of noise one one is very voluminous butnoisy and the others rare but you can
 you can probably trust it yeah it's

1:17:50
Speaker 1 :interesting I think between those
 signals captures all the information you'd want to capture I mean there's afeeling a shallow feeling for me that
 there's sometimes I'll hear songs like yes this is you know this was the rightsong for the moment but there's really
 no way to express that fact except by listening through it all the way yeahand maybe playing it again at that time
 or something yeah there's no need for a button that saysthis was the best song I could have
 heard at this moment well we're playing

1:18:20
Speaker 0 :around with that with kind of the thumbs
 up concept saying like I really like this just kind of talking to thealgorithm it's unclear if that's the
 best way for you miss to interact maybe it is maybe they should think of Spotifyhas a person an agent sitting there
 trying to serve you and you can say like that's modified good Spotify right nowthe analogy we've had is more you
 shouldn't think of us we should be invested oh and the feedback is if yousave it it's kind of you work for
 yourself you do a playlist because you think is great and we can learn fromthat it's kind of back to back to Tesla
 how they kind of have that shadow mode they sit in what you drive we kind oftook the same analogy we stayed in watch
 your playlist and then maybe we can we can offer you an autopilot where you cantake over for a while or something like
 that and then back off if you say like that's not that's not good enoughbut but I think it's interesting to
 figure out what your mental model s if Spotify is an AI that you talk to whichI think might be a bit too abstract for
 for many consumers or if you still think of it as it's my music app but it's just

1:19:24
Speaker 1 :more helpful and depends on the device
 it's running on which brings us to smart speakers so I have a lot of the Spotifylistening I do is on things like on
 device they can talk to you whether it's from Amazon Google or Apple what's therole Spotify on those devices how do you
 think of it differently then on the phone or on the desktop there are few

1:19:47
Speaker 0 :things to say about the first of all
 it's incredibly exciting they're growing like crazy especially here in the in thein the US and it's solving a consumer
 need that I think is is you can think of it as just remote interactivity you cancontrol this thing from from from across
 the room and it might may feel like a small thing but it turns out thatfriction matters to consumers being able
 to say play pause and so forth from across the room is very powerful sobasically you made you made the living
 room interactive now and what we see in our data is that the the number one usecase for these speakers is music music
 and podcasts so fortunately for us it's been important to these companies tohave those use case covered so they
 wanted Spotify on this we have very good relationships with with them and we'reseeing we're seeing tremendous success
 for them what what I think it's interesting about them is it's alreadyworking with we kind of had this
 epiphany many years ago back when we started using Sonos if you went throughall the trouble of setting up your sonar
 system you had this magical experience where you had all the music ever made inyour living room and and we we we made
 this assumption that the home everyone use that a CD player at home but theynever managed to get their files working
 in the home having this network attached which was too cumbersome for mostconsumers so we made the assumption that
 the home would skip from the CD all the way to streaming books where where youwill get would by the steering without
 all the music built-in that took longer than we thought but with the voicespeakers that was the unlocking that
 made kind of the connected speaker happen in the home so so it really itreally exploded and we saw this
 engagement that we predicted would happen what I think is interestingthough is where it's going from now
 right now you think of them as voice speakers but I think if you look atGoogle i/o for example they just added a
 camera to it where you know when the alarm goes off instead of saying heyGoogle stop you can just wave your hand
 so I think they're gonna think more of it as a as an agent or as an assistanttruly an assistant and an assistant that
 can see you it's gonna be much more effective than then a blind assistant soI think these things will morph and we
 won't necessarily think of them as quote-unquote voice speakers anymorejust as interactive access to the
 Internet in the home but I still think that the biggest use case for those willbe will be audio so for that reason
 we're investing heavily in it and we've built our own NLU stack to be able tothe the challenge here is how do you
 innovate in that well it's it's it lowers friction for consumers but it'salso much more constrained there you
 have no pixels to play with in an in an audio-only world it's really thevocabulary that is the interface so we
 started investing and playing around quite a lot with that trying tounderstand what the future will be of
 you speaking and gesturing and waving at

1:23:04
Speaker 1 :your music and actually you're actually
 nudging closer to the autonomous vehicle space because from everything I've seenthe level of frustration people
 experience upon failure of natural language understanding is much higherthan failure in other content people get
 frustrated really fast so if you screw screw that experience up even just alittle bit they give up really quickly


1:23:27
Speaker 0 :yeah and I think you see that in the
 data while well it's tremendously successfulthe most common interactions are play
 pause and you know next the things were if youcompare it to taking up your phone
 unlocking you bringing up the app and skipping clicking skip yeah it was itwas much lower friction but then for for
 longer more complicated things like you if I mean that song about peoplestopping up the phone and search and
 then play it on their speaker so we tried again to build a fault-tolerant UIwhere for the more for the more
 complicated things you can still pick up your phone have powerful full keyboardsearch and then try to optimize for
 whether it's actually lower friction and try to it's it's kind of like the testautopilot thing you have to be at the
 level where you're helpful if you're too smart and just in the way people are

1:24:16
Speaker 1 :gonna get frustrated and first of all
 I'm not obsessed with stairway to heaven it's just a good song but let me mentionthat as a use case because it's an
 interesting one I've literally told one of I don't want to say the name of thespeaker cuz though when people are
 listening to it'll make their speaker go off but I talk to the speaker and I sayplay stairway to heaven and every time
 it like not every time but a large percent of the time plays the wrongstairway to heaven it plays like some
 cover of the and that that part of the experience I actually wonder from abusiness perspective the Spotify control
 that entire experience or no it seems like the NLU the the natural languagestuff is controlled by the speaker and
 then Spotify stays at a layer below that

1:25:04
Speaker 0 :it is a good and complicated question
 some of which is dependent on the on the partner so it's hard to comment on theown specifics but the question is the
 right one the challenges if you can't use any other personalization I mean weknow which stairway to heaven and and
 the truth is maybe for for one person it is exactly the cover that they want andthey will be very frustrated if a place
 I I think we I think we default to the right version but but you actually wantto be able to do the cover for the
 person that just played the cover 50 times or Spotify is just gonna seemstupid so you want to be able to
 leverage the personalization but you have this stack where where you have thethe ASR and this thing called the N best
 list so then that guesses here and then the presentation comes inat the end you actually want the
 personalization to be here when you're guessing about what they actually meantso we're working with these partners and
 it's a complicated it's a complicated thing where you want to you want to beable so first of all you want to be very
 careful with you users data you don't share your users data withoutthe permission but you want to share
 some data so that their experience gets betterso that these partners can understand
 enough but not too much and so forth so it's really the trick is that it's likea business driven relationship where
 you're doing product development across companies together yeah which is whichis really complicated but this is
 exactly why we built our own NLU so that we actually can make personalizedguesses because this is the biggest
 frustration from a user point of view they don't understand about ASRs and nbest lists and and business deals
 they're like how hard can it be I've told this thing 50 times in thisversion and still applies the wrong
 thing it can't it can't be hard so we try to take the user approach if theuser the users not going to understand
 the complications of business we have to solve it let's talk about sort of a

1:26:54
Speaker 1 :complicated subject that I myself I'm
 quite torn about the idea of sort of paying artists right I saw as of August31st 2018 over 11 billion dollars were
 paid to rights holders so and further distributed to artists from Spotify so alot of money is being paid to artists
 first of all the whole time is a consumer for me when I look at SpotifyI'm not sure I'm remembering correctly
 but I think you said exactly how I feel which is this is too good to be truelike when I started using Spotify I
 assume you guys will go bankrupt in like a month it's like this is too good a lot

1:27:44
Speaker 0 :

1:27:46
Speaker 1 :of people did like this is amazing so
 one question I have is sort of the bigger question how do you make money inthis complicated world how do you deal
 with a relationship with record labels whoare complicated these big you're
 essentially and have the task of herding catsbut like rich and powerful cats and also
 have the task of paying artists enough and paying those labels enough and stillmaking money in the internet space or
 people are not willing to pay hundreds of dollars a month so how do younavigate the space how do you know


1:28:31
Speaker 0 :that's a beautiful description hurting
 rich cats yeah that's before it is very complicated and I think certainlyactually betting against Porter fire has
 been statistically a very smart thing to do just looking at the at the line ofroadkill in music streaming services
 it's it's kind of I think if I had understood the complexity when I joinedSpotify unfortunately fortunately I
 didn't know enough about the music industry to understand the complexitiesbecause then I would have made a more
 rational guess that it wouldn't work so you know ignorant is bliss but I thinkthere have been a few distinct
 challenges I think as I said one of the things that made it work at all was thatSweden and the Nordic was a lost market
 so there was you know there was there was no risk for labels to try this Idon't think it would have worked if if
 the market was was healthy so so that was the initial condition then then wehad this tremendous challenge with the
 model itself so now most people were pirating but for the people who bought adownload or CD the artists will get all
 the revenue for all the future plays then right so you got it all up frontwhereas the streaming model was like
 almost nothing they want almost nothing they - and then at some point this curveof incremental revenue would intersect
 with your day one payment and that took a long time to play out before beforethe music labels they understood that
 but on the other side it took a lot of time to understand that actually if Ihave a big hit that is gonna be played
 for for many years this is a much better modelbecause I get paid based on how much
 people use the product not how much they thought they would use it day one or soforth so it was a complicated model to
 get across and but time helped with that right and now now the revenues to themusic industry actually are bigger again
 then you know it's gone through this incredible dip and now they're back upand so we're we're very really proud of
 having having been a part of that so there have been distinct problems Ithink when it comes to the to the labels
 we have taken the painful approach some of our competition at the time they kindof they kind of look that other
 companies instead if we just if we just ignore the rights and we get really bigreally fast we're gonna be too big for
 the the labels too kind of too big to fail they're not gonna kill us we didn'ttake that approach we went legal from
 day one and we we negotiated and negotiated and negotiated was very slowis very frustrating we were angry at
 seeing other companies taking shortcuts and seeming to get away with it it wasthis this this game theory thing where
 over many rounds of playing the game this would be the right strategy andeven though to clearly there's a lot of
 frustrations at times during negotiations there is this there is thisweird trust where we have been honest
 and fair we never screw them the inner screwed us it's ten years but there'sthis trust in like they know that if
 music doesn't get really big if lots of people do not want to listen to music Iwant to pay for it
 Spotify has no business model so we actually are incredibly aligned rightother companies not to be tense but
 other companies have other business models where even if they may know musicfrom no money from music they still be
 profitable companies but fall if I want so and I think the industry sees that weare actually aligned business-wise so
 there is this distrust that allows us to to do product development even if it'sscary you know taking risks the free
 model itself was an incredible risk for the music industry to take that theyshould get credit for now some of it was
 that they had nothing to lose in Sweden but frankly a lot of the labels alsotook risk and so I think we built up
 that trust with a I think hurting what cats soundsa bit what's the word it sounds like I'm
 dismissive of the guests dismissive no everyday yeah you matter they're all

1:32:36
Speaker 1 :beautiful and and very important exactly


1:32:39
Speaker 0 :they've taken a lot of risks and
 certainly it's been frustrating about it

1:32:43
Speaker 1 :

1:32:44
Speaker 0 :yeah it's it's it's really like playing
 its its game theory if you play that if you play the game many times and thenyou can have this statistical outcome
 that you bet on and it feels very painful when you're in the middle ofthat thing I mean there's risk this


1:32:57
Speaker 1 :trust there's relationships from just
 having read the biography of Steve Jobs similar kind of relationship werediscussed in iTunes the idea of selling
 a song for a dollar was very uncomfortable for labels and exactly andthere was no it was the same kind of
 thing it was trust it was game theory as is a lot of our relationships that hadto be built and it's really a
 terrifyingly difficult process that Apple could go through a little bitbecause they could afford for that
 process to fail for Spotify it seems terrifying because you can't initially I

1:33:37
Speaker 0 :think a lot of it comes out comes down
 to honestly Daniel and his tenacity in in negotiating which seems like animpossible this is a fun task because he
 was completely unknown and so forth but maybe that was also the reason that thatit worked
 but I think yeah I think game theory is probably the best way to think about ityou could straight go straight for this
 like Nash equilibrium that someone is going to defect or or you played manytimes you try to actually go for the top
 left the corporation cell is there any

1:34:13
Speaker 1 :magical reason why Spotify seems to have
 won this so a lot of people have tried to do a spot if I try to do and Spotify

1:34:25
Speaker 0 :has come out well so the order is that
 there's no magical reason because I I don't believe in magic but I think thereare there are reasons and I think some
 of them are that people have misunderstood a lot of what we actuallydo the actual the actual Spotify model
 is very complicated they've looked at the premium model and said it seems likeyou can you can charge $9.99 for music
 and people are gonna pay but that's not what happened actually when we launchedthe original mobile product everyone
 said they would never pay what happened was they started on the on the freeproduct and then their engagement grew
 so much that eventually they said maybe it is worth $9.99 right it's it's yourpropensity to pay grows with your
 engagement so we had this super complicated business model we operatetwo different business model advertising
 and premium at the same time and I think that is hard to replicate however Istruggled to think of other companies
 that run large-scale advertising and subscription products at the same timeso I think the business model is
 actually much more complicated than people think it is and and so somepeople went after just the premium part
 without the free part and ran into a wall where no one wanted to pay somepeople went after just music music
 should be free just ads which doesn't give you enough revenue and doesn't workfor the music industry so I think that
 combination is kind of a pick from the outside so maybe I shouldn't say it hereand reveal the secret but that that
 turns out to be hard to replicate then you with then you would think so there's

1:35:57
Speaker 1 :a lot of brilliant business strategy


1:35:59
Speaker 0 :here brilliance or luck
 probably more luck but it doesn't really matter it looks brilliantin retrospect let's call it brilliant


1:36:07
Speaker 1 :yeah when the books are read no
 brilliant you've mentioned that your philosophy is to embrace change so howwill the music streaming and music
 listening world change over the next 10 years 20 years you look out into the farfuture what do you think I think that


1:36:28
Speaker 0 :music and for that matter
 audio podcasts audiobooks I think it's one of the few core human needs I thinkit there is no good reason to me why it
 shouldn't be at the scale of something like messaging or social networking Idon't think it's a nice thing to listen
 to music or news or something so I think scale is obviously one of the thingsthat I really hope for I think I hope
 that it's going to be billions of users I hope eventually everyone in the worldgets access to all the world's music
 ever made so obviously I think it's going to be a much bigger businessotherwise we we wouldn't be betting this
 big now if you if you look more at how it is consumed what I'm hoping is backto this analogy of the software tool
 chain where I think I sometimes internally I make this analogy to totext messaging text messaging was also
 based on standards in the in the area of mobile carriers you had the SMS the 140character 2020 carrot SMS and it was
 great because everyone agreed on the standard so as a consumer you got a lotof distributions and interoperability
 but it was a very constrained format and and when the industry wanted to addpictures to that format to do the MMS I
 looked it up and I think it took from the late 80s to early 2000 this is likea 15 20 year product cycle to bring
 pictures into that now once that entire value chain of creation and consumptiongot wrapped in one software stack with
 in something like snapchat or whatsapp like the first week they had adisappearing messages like then two
 weeks later they added stories like the pace of innovation when you're on onesoftware stack and you can you can you
 can affect both creation and consumption I think is going to be rapid so withthese streaming services we now for the
 first time in history have enough I hope people on one of these services actuallywhether it's Spotify or Amazon or Apple
 or or YouTube and hopefully enough creators that you can actually startworking with a format again and and that
 excites me I think being able to change these constraints from a hundred yearsthat could really that could really do
 something interesting I don't I really hope it's not just going to be theiriteration on on the same thing for the
 next ten to twenty years as well

1:38:47
Speaker 1 :yeah changing the creation of music
 equation of audio equation of podcast is a really fascinating possibility Imyself don't understand what it is about
 podcast that's so intimate it just is I listen to a lot of podcasts I think ittouches on a human and a deep human need
 for connection that people do feel like they're connected to when they listen Idon't understand what the psychology
 that is but in this world that's becoming more and more disconnected itfeels like this is fulfilling a certain
 kind of need and empowering the creator as opposed to just the listener it'sreally interesting so this is I'm really
 excited that you're working on it yeah I

1:39:34
Speaker 0 :think one of the things that is
 inspiring for our teams to work on podcast is exactly that what do youthink like I like I probably do that
 it's something biological about perceiving to be in the middle of theconversation that makes you listen in a
 different way it doesn't really matter people seem to perceive it differentlyand there was this narrative for a long
 time that you know if you look at video everything kind of in the foreground Igot shorter and shorter and shorter
 because of financial pressure is a monetization and so forth an event atthe end there zones like 20 seconds
 clipped people just screaming something and I'm really I feel really good aboutthe fact that you you could have
 interpreted that as people have no attention span anymore they don't wantto listen to things they're not
 interested in deeper stories like you know people are people are gettingdumber
 but then podcast came along and it's almost like no no they need stillexisted once what but maybe maybe it was
 the fact that you're not prepared to look at your phone like this for twohours but if you can drive at the same
 time it seems like people really want to digand they want to hear like the more
 complicated version so to me that is very inspiring that that podcast isactually long-form it gives me a lot of
 hope for for Humanity that people seem really interested in hearing deeper morecomplicated this is a I don't understand


1:40:51
Speaker 1 :it it's fascinating so the majority for
 this podcast listen to the whole thing this whole conversation we've beentalking for an hour and 45 minutes and
 somebody will I mean most people will be listening to these words I'm speaking

1:41:07
Speaker 0 :right now they wouldn't have thought
 that 10 years ago with what the world seemed to go that's very positive I

1:41:12
Speaker 1 :think that's really exciting and
 empowering the creator and there's really exciting last question you alsohave a passion for just mobile in
 general how do you see the smartphone world this the the digital space of ofsmartphones and just everything that's
 on the move whether it's Internet of Things and so on changing over the next10 years and so on I think that one way


1:41:42
Speaker 0 :to think about it is that computing
 might be moving out of these multi-purpose devices the computer wehad in the phone into specific specific
 specific purpose devices and you know it will be ambient that you know at leastin my home you just shout something at
 someone and there's always like one of these speakers close enough and so youstart behaving differently it's as if
 you have the Internet ambient ambiently around you and you canask it things
 so I think computing or kind of get more integrated and we won we won'tnecessarily think of that as as
 connected to a device and the same thing in the same way that we do today I don'tknow the path to that maybe we used to
 have these desktop computers and then we partially replace that with the with thelaptops and left you know at home and at
 work and then we got these phones and we started leaving the laptop at home for awhile and maybe the maybe for stretches
 of time you're gonna start using the watch and you can leave your your phoneat home like for a run or something and
 you know we're on this progressive path where you I think what what is happeningwith the voice is that you haven't you
 have an interactive interaction paradigm that doesn't require as large physicaldevices so I definitely think there's a
 future where you can have your your airports and and your watch and you cando a lot of computing and I don't think
 it's gonna be this binary thing I think it's gonna be like many of us still havea laptop we just use it less and so you
 shift your your consumption over and I don't know about a or glasses and soforth um I'm excited about I spend a lot
 of time in that area but I still think

1:43:36
Speaker 1 :it's quite far away they are VR oh yes


1:43:37
Speaker 0 :VR is is happening and working I think
 the recent oculus quest is quite impressive I think AR is further away atleast that type of AR I think but I do
 think your phone or water glasses understanding where you are and maybewhat you're looking at and being able to
 give you all your cues about or you can say like what is this and it tells youwhat it is that I think might happen you
 you know you use your your watch to your glasses there's a as a mouse pointer onreality I think it might be a while
 before I might be wrong I hope I'm wrong I think it might be a while before wewalk around with these big like lab
 glasses then project things I agree with

1:44:16
Speaker 1 :you there's a it's actually really
 difficult when you have to understand the physical world enough to projectonto it well I lied about the last
 question because I just thought of audio and myfavorite topic which is the movie her
 mm-hmm do you think well there's part of Spotify or not will have I don't know if

1:44:43
Speaker 0 :you've seen the movie her absolutely and


1:44:45
Speaker 1 :their audio is the primary form of
 interaction and the connection with another entity that you can actuallyhave a relationship with actually fall
 in love with based on voice alone audio alone you how far do you think that'spossible first of all based on audio
 alone to fall in love with somebody somebody or well yeah let's go withsomebody just have a relationship based
 on audio alone and second question to that can we create an artificialintelligence system that allows one to
 fall in love with it and hurt him with

1:45:22
Speaker 0 :you so there's my personal personal
 answer speaking for me as a person the answer is quite unequivocally yes onboth I think what we just said about
 podcasts and the feeling of being in the middle of a conversation if you couldhave an assistant where and we just said
 that feels like a very personal settings so if you walk around with theseheadphones and this thing you're
 speaking with this thing all of the time that feels like it's in your brain Ithink it's it's gonna be much easier to
 fall in love with than something that would be on your screen I think that'sentirely possible and then from that you
 can programs is better than me but from the concept of if it's going to bepossible to build a machine that they
 can achieve that I think whether you whether you think of it as if you canfake it the philosophical zombie that it
 simulates it enough or it it somehow actually is I think there's it's onlyquestion if you ask me about time I'd
 had to be a financier but if you say a given some half infinite time absolutelyI think it's just atoms and arrangement


1:46:29
Speaker 1 :of information well I personally think
 that love is a lot simpler than people think so we started with true romanceand ended in love I don't see a better
 place to end beautiful Gustav thanks so much for talking to
