Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with


0:00:01
Speaker 0 :keoki Jackson he's the CTO of Lockheed


0:00:03
Speaker 1 :Martin a company that through his long


0:00:08
Speaker 0 :history has created some of the most
 incredible engineering Marvel's human beings have ever built including planes

0:00:14
Speaker 1 :that fly fast and undetected defense


0:00:17
Speaker 0 :systems that intersect nuclear threats
 that can take the lives of millions and systems the venture out into space the

0:00:23
Speaker 1 :

0:00:26
Speaker 0 :moon Mars and beyond in these days more


0:00:29
Speaker 1 :

0:00:30
Speaker 0 :and more artificial intelligence has an
 assistive role to play in these systems

0:00:34
Speaker 1 :I've read several books reparation for


0:00:36
Speaker 0 :this conversation is a difficult one


0:00:40
Speaker 1 :because in part Lockheed Martin builds


0:00:43
Speaker 0 :military systems that operate in a
 complicated world that often does not

0:00:45
Speaker 1 :

0:00:46
Speaker 0 :have easy solutions in the grey area


0:00:47
Speaker 1 :

0:00:50
Speaker 0 :between good and evil I hope one day


0:00:52
Speaker 1 :this world will rid itself of war in all


0:00:56
Speaker 0 :its forms
 but two paths to achieving that in a

0:00:59
Speaker 1 :

0:01:00
Speaker 0 :world that does have evil is not obvious


0:01:01
Speaker 1 :

0:01:03
Speaker 0 :what is obvious is good engineering and
 artificial intelligence research has a role to play on the side of good

0:01:11
Speaker 1 :Lockheed Martin and the rest of our


0:01:13
Speaker 0 :community are hard at work at exactly


0:01:17
Speaker 1 :this task we talk about these and other


0:01:17
Speaker 0 :important topics in this conversation


0:01:20
Speaker 1 :

0:01:22
Speaker 0 :also most certainly both keoki and I
 have a passion for space us humans venturing out toward the Stars we talkabout this exciting future as well this

 Twitter at Lux Friedman spelled Fri D M

0:01:50
Speaker 0 :am and now here's my conversation with K


0:01:54
Speaker 1 :okie Jackson
 I read several books on Lockheed Martin recently my favorite in particulars byBen rich called skunkworks
 personal memoir it gets a little edgy at times but from that I was reminded thatthe engineers of Lockheed Martin have
 created some of the most incredible engineering Marvel's human beings haveever built throughout the centuries
 throughout the 20th century and the 21st do you remember a particular project orsystem and Lockheed or before that at
 the space shuttle Columbia that you were just in awe at the fact that us humanscould create something like this you


0:02:30
Speaker 0 :know that's a that's a great question
 there's a lot of things that I could draw in there when you look at the skunkworks and Ben Rich's book in particular
 of course it starts off with basically the start of the jet age and the p80I had the opportunity to sit next to one
 of the Apollo astronauts Charlie Duke recently at dinner and I said hey what'syour favorite aircraft and he said well
 was by far the f-104 starfighter which was another aircraft that came out ofLockheed there what was the first Mach 2
 jet fighter aircraft they called it the missile with a man in itand so those are the kinds of things I
 grew up hearing stories about you know of course the sr-71 is incomparable asyou know kind of the epitome of speed
 altitude and just the coolest looking aircraft ever so so there's aconnoisseur that's a flame that's a yeah
 intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft that wasdesigned to be able to outrun basically
 go faster than any air defense system but you know I'll tell you I'm a spacejunkie junkie that's why I came to MIT
 that's really what took me ultimately to Lockheed Martin and I grew up in soLockheed Martin for example has been
 essentially at the heart of every planetary mission like all the Marsmissions we've had a part in and we've
 talked a lot about the 50th anniversary of Apollo here in the last couple ofweeks right but
 remember 1976 July 20th again national space days the landing of the Viking theViking Lander on the surface of Mars
 just a huge accomplishment and when I was a young engineer at Lockheed MartinI got to meet engineers who had designed
 you know various pieces of that mission as well so that's what I grew up on isthese planetary missions the start of
 the Space Shuttle era and ultimately had the opportunity to see Lockheed Martin'spart and we can maybe talk about some of
 these here but Lockheed Martin's part in all of these space journeys over the

0:04:45
Speaker 1 :years do you dream and I apologize for
 getting philosophical at times or sentimental I do romanticize the notionof space exploration
 so do you dream of the day when us humans colonize another planet like Marsor a man a woman a human being steps on


0:05:01
Speaker 0 :Mars absolutely and that's a personal
 dream of mine I haven't given up yet on my own opportunity to fly into space butbut as you know from the Lockheed Martin
 perspective this is something that we're working towards every day and of courseyou know we're we're building the Orion
 spacecraft which is the most sophisticated human-rated spacecraftever built and it's really designed for
 these deep-space journeys you know starting with the moon but ultimatelygoing to Mars and being the platform you
 know from a design perspective we call the Mars base camp to be able to takehumans to the surface and then after a
 mission of a couple of weeks bring him back up safely and so that is somethingI want to see happen during my time at
 Lockheed Martin so I'm pretty excited about thatand I think you know once we prove
 that's possible you know colonization might be a little bit further out butit's something that I'd hoped to see so


0:05:59
Speaker 1 :maybe you can give a little bit an
 overview of the Lockheed Martin's partner with a few years ago with Boeingto work with the DoD and NASA to build
 launch systems and rockets with the ula what's beyond thatwhat's lakis mission timeline and
 long-term dream in terms of space you mentioned the moon I've heard youtalk about asteroids as Mars what's the
 timeline what's the engineering challenges and

0:06:30
Speaker 0 :what's the dream long term yeah I think
 the dream long term is to have a permanent presence in space beyondlow-earth orbit ultimately with a
 long-term presence on the moon and then to the planets to Mars and rage

0:06:45
Speaker 1 :interrupt and that's a long term


0:06:47
Speaker 0 :presence means sustained and sustainable
 presence and an economy a space economy that really goes alongside with human

0:06:54
Speaker 1 :beings being and being able to launch
 perhaps from those so like hop you know

0:07:01
Speaker 0 :it says that there's a lot of energy
 that goes in those hops right so I think the first step is being able to getthere and to be able to establish
 sustained basis right and and build from there and a lot of that means getting asyou know things like the cost of launch
 down and you mentioned United Launch Alliance and so I don't want to speakfor ula but obviously they're they're
 working really hard to on their next generation of space launch vehicles toyou know maintain that incredible
 mission success record that ula has but ultimately continue to drive down thecost and make the flexibility the speed
 and the access ever greater so what's

0:07:46
Speaker 1 :the missions that are in the horizon
 that you could talk to so I hope to get

0:07:52
Speaker 0 :to the moon absolutely absolutely I mean
 I think you know this or you may know this you know there's a lot of ways toaccomplish some of these goals and so
 that's a lot of what's in discussion today but ultimately the the goal is tobe able to establish a base essentially
 insist lunar space that would allow for ready transfer from orbit to the lunarsurface and back again and so that's
 sort of that near-term and I say near-term in the next decade or sovision
 starting off with you know stated objective by this administration to getback to the moon in the nineteen or the
 2024 2025 timeframe which is is right around the corner here so how big of anengineering challenge is that I think
 the big challenge is not so much to go but to stay rightand so we demonstrated in the 60s that
 you could send somebody up to a couple of days of mission and bring them homeagain successfully now we're talking
 about doing that I'd say more time I was saying adust real scale but a sustainedscale right so permanent habitation you
 know regular reuse of vehicles the infrastructure to get things like fuelair consumables replacement parts all
 the things that you need to sustain that kind of infrastructure so those arecertainly engineering challenges there
 are budgetary challenges and those are all things that we're gonna have to workthrough you know the other thing and I
 shouldn't I don't want to minimize this I mean I'm excited about humanexploration but the reality is our
 technology and where we've come over the last you know forty years essentiallyhas changed what we can do with robotic
 exploration as well and you know to me it's incredibly thrilling this seemslike old news now but the fact that we
 have Rovers driving around the surface of Mars and sending back data is justincredible the fact that we have
 satellites in orbit around Mars that are collecting weather you know they'relooking at the terrain they're mapping
 all these kinds of things on a continuous basis that's incredible andthe fact that you know it's you got the
 time lag of course going to the going to the planets but you can effectively havevirtual human presence there in a way
 that we have never been able to do beforeand now with the advent of even greater
 processing power better AI systems better cognitive systems and decisionsystems you know you put that together
 with the human Keith and we really opened up the solarsystem in a whole different way and I'll
 give you an example we've got osiris-rex which is a missionto the asteroid Bennu so the spacecraft
 is out there right now I'm basically a year mapping activity to map the entiresurface of that asteroid in great detail
 you know all autonomously piloted right with the idea then that this is not toofar away it's gonna go in it's got a
 sort of fancy vacuum cleaner with a bucket it's gonna collect the sample offthe asteroid and then send it back here
 to earth and so you know we have gone from sort of those tentative steps inthe 70s you know early landings video of
 the solar system so now we've sent spacecraft the Pluto we have gone tocomets and brought and an intercept at
 comets we've brought stardust date you know you know material backso that's we've gone far and there's
 incredible opportunity to go even farther

0:11:43
Speaker 1 :so it seems quite crazy that this is
 even possible that can you talk a little bit aboutwhat it means to orbit an asteroid and
 with a bucket to try to keep pick up

0:11:57
Speaker 0 :some soil samples yeah so part of it is
 just kind of the you know these are the kinds of techniques we use here on earthfor high speed high speed high accuracy
 imagery stitching these scenes together and creating essentially high accuracyworld maps right and so that's what
 we're doing obviously on a much smaller scale with an asteroid but the otherthing that's really interesting you put
 together sort of that neat control and you know data and imagery problem butthe stories around how we design the
 collection I mean as essentially you know this is the sort of the humaningenuity element right that essentially
 you know had an engineer who had a one-day cycle starts messing around withparts vacuum cleaner bucket you know
 maybe we could do something like this and that was what led to what we callthe pogo stick collection right we're
 basically I think comes down it's only there for seconds does that collectiongrabs the essentially blows them the
 regolith material into the collection hopper and off it goesit doesn't really land almost it's it's
 a very short landing Wow that's that's

0:13:13
Speaker 1 :incredible so what is uh in those talk a
 little bit more about space eh what's the role of the human in all of thiswhat are the challenges what are the
 opportunities for humans as they pilot these these vehicles in space and forhumans that may step foot and on either


0:13:40
Speaker 0 :the Moon or Mars yeah it's a great
 question because you know I just have been extolling the virtues of roboticand you know Rovers autonomous systems
 and those absolutely have a role I think the thing that we don't know how toreplace today is the ability to adapt on
 the fly to new information and I believe that will come but we'renot there yet there's a ways to go and
 so you know you think back to Apollo 13 and the ingenuity of the folks on theground and on the spacecraft essentially
 cobbled together a way to get the carbon dioxide scrubbers to work those are thekinds of things that ultimately young
 and I'd say not just from dealing with anomalies but you know dealing with newinformation you see something and rather
 than waiting twenty minutes or half an hour an hour to try to get informationback and forth but be able to
 essentially Ravech there on the fly collect you know different samples takea different approach choose different
 areas to explore those are the kinds of things that that human presence enablesthat is still a ways ahead of us on the
 AI side yeah there's some interesting

0:15:00
Speaker 1 :stuff we'll talk about on the teaming
 side here on earth that's that's pretty

0:15:05
Speaker 0 :cool to explore and it's okay so let's
 not leave the space piece out so what is

0:15:08
Speaker 1 :teaming what does AI and humans working
 together in space look like yeah one of

0:15:13
Speaker 0 :the things we're working on is a system
 called Maya which is you can think of it it's what's an AI assistant and in spaceexactly and you think of it as the Alexa
 in space right but this goes hand-in-hand with a lot of otherdevelopments and so today's world
 everything is essentially model-based model-based systems engineering to theactual digital tapestry that goes
 through the design the bill the manufacturer the testing and ultimatelythe sustainment of the system and so our
 vision is really that you know when our astronauts are there around Mars you'regoing to have that entire digital
 library of the spacecraft of its operations allthe test data all the test data and
 flight data from previous missions to be able to look and see if there areanomalous conditions until the humans
 and potentially deal with that before it becomes a bad situation and help theastronauts work through those kinds of
 things and it's not just you know dealing with problems as they come upbut also offering up opportunities for
 additional exploration capability for examples so so that's the vision is thatyou know these are going to take the
 best of the human to respond to to changing circumstances and rely on thebest of AI capabilities to monitor these
 you know this almost infinite number of data points and correlations and datapoints that humans frankly aren't that


0:16:53
Speaker 1 :good at it's how do you develop systems
 in space like this whether it's a alexa in space or in general any kind ofcontrol systems any kind of intelligent
 systems when you can't really test stuff too much out in space it's veryexpensive to test stuff here so how do
 you develop such systems yeah that's

0:17:13
Speaker 0 :that that's the beauty of this digital
 twin if you will and of course with Lockheed Martin we've over the past youknow five plus decades been refining our
 knowledge of the space environment of how materials behave dynamics thatcontrols the you know radiation
 environments all of these kinds of things so we're able to create verysophisticated models they're not perfect
 but they're they're very good and so you can actually do a lot I spent part of mycareer you know simulating communication
 spacecraft you know missile warning spacecraft GPSspacecraft in all kinds of scenarios and
 all kinds of environments so this is really just taking that to the nextlevel the interesting thing is that now
 you're bringing into that loop a system depending on how its developed that maybe non-deterministic it may be learned
 as it goes in fact we anticipate that it will be learning as it goes and so thatbrings a whole new level of interest I
 guess into how do you do verification and validation of thesenon-deterministic learning systems in
 scenarios that may go out of the bounds or the envelope that you have initially

0:18:35
Speaker 1 :designed to so had this system in its
 intelligence has the same complexity some of the same complex as a human doesthan the it learns over time it's
 unpredictable in certain kinds of ways in the so you still you also have tomodel that when you're thinking about
 saying you're in your thoughts as possible to model the the majority ofsituations the the important aspects of
 situations here on earth and in space enough to test stuff yeah that's this is

0:19:02
Speaker 0 :really an active area of research and
 we're actually funding University Research in a variety of placesincluding MIT this is in the realm of
 trust and verification and validation of I'd say autonomous systems in generaland then as a subset of that autonomous
 systems that incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities and this isnot an easy problem we're working with
 startup companies we've got internal R&D but our conviction is the autonomy inmore and more AI enabled autonomy is
 going to be in everything that Lockheed Martin develops and fields and it'sgoing to be retrofit autonomy and Nai
 are gonna be retrofit into existing systems they're going to be part of thedesign for all of our future systems and
 so maybe I should take a step back and say the way we define autonomy so wetalk we talk about autonomy essentially
 system that composes selects and then executes decisions with varying levelsof human intervention and so you could
 think of no autonomy so this is essentially human doing the task you canthink of effectively partial autonomy
 where the human is in the loop so making decisions in every case aboutwhat the autonomous system can do either


0:20:31
Speaker 1 :

0:20:32
Speaker 0 :in the cockpit or remotely or remotely
 exactly but still in that control loop and then there's what you'd callsupervisory autonomy the autonomous
 system is doing most of the work the human can intervene to stop it or tochange the direction and then ultimately
 fall at full autonomy where the human is off the loop altogether and fordifferent types of missions want to have
 different levels of autonomy so now take that spectrum and this conviction thatautonomy and more and more AI are in
 everything that we develop I the kinds of things that Lockheed Martin does youknow a lot of times our safety of life
 critical kinds of missions you think about aircraft for example and so werequire and our customers require an
 extremely high level of confidence one that you know we're going to protectlife to that we're going to have that
 these systems will behave in ways that their operators can understand and sothis gets into that whole field again
 you know they're being able to verify and validate that the systems have beenand that they will operate the way
 they're design and the way they're expected and furthermore that they willdo that in ways that can be explained
 and understood and that is an extremely difficult challenge yes so here's a

0:21:58
Speaker 1 :difficult question I don't mean to bring
 this up but I think it's a good case study that people are familiar with theBoeing 737 max commercial airplane has
 had two recent crashes where their flight control software system failedand it's software so I don't mean to
 speak of all Boeing but broadly speaking we have this than the autonomous vehiclespace - semi autonomous we have millions
 of lines of code software making decisions there is a little bit of aclash of cultures because software
 engineers don't have the same culture of safety oftenthat people who build systems like at
 Lockheed Martin uh do where it has to be exceptionally safe you have to test thison so how do we get this right when
 software is making so many decisions

0:22:52
Speaker 0 :yeah and this there's a lot of things
 that have to happen and by and large I think it starts with the culture rightwhich is not necessarily something that
 a is taught in school or B is something that would come here depending on whatkind of software you're developing it
 may not be relevant right if you're targeting ads or something like that soand by and large say not just Lockheed
 Martin but certainly the aerospace industry of the whole has developed aculture that does focus on safety safety
 of life operational safety mission success but as you know these systemshave gotten incredibly complex and so
 they're to the point where it's almost impossible you know state space hasbecome so huge that it's impossible to
 or very difficult to do a systematic verification across the entire set ofpotential ways that an aircraft could be
 flown all the conditions that could happen all the potential failure failurescenarios now maybe that's soluble one
 day maybe when we have our quantum computers at our fingertips we'll beable to actually simulate across an
 entire you know almost infinite state space but today you know there's athere's a lot of work to really try to
 bound the system to understand predictable ways and then have thisculture of continuous inquiry and
 skepticism and questioning to say did we really consider the right realm ofpossibilities have we done the right
 range of testing do we really understand you know in this case you know human andmachine interactions the human decision
 process alongside the machine processes and so that's that culture that we callit the culture of
 success in lockheed-martin that really needs to be established and it's notsomething you know that it's something
 that people learn by living in it and it's something that has to bepromulgated you know and it's done you
 know from the highest levels at a company of Lockheed Martin like Lockheed

0:25:10
Speaker 1 :Martin yeah and the same as being faced
 at certain on his vehicle companies where that culture is not there becauseit started mostly by software engineers
 so that's what they're struggling with is there lessons that you think weshould learn as an industry in a society
 from the Boeing 737 max questions these

0:25:29
Speaker 0 :crashes obviously are their tremendous
 tragedies their tragedies for all of the people the the crew the families thepassengers the people on the ground
 involved and you know it's also a huge business and economic setback as well Imean you know we've seen that it's
 impacting essentially the trade balance of the US so these are these areimportant questions and these are the
 kinds that you know we've seen similar kinds of questioning at times you goback to the Challenger accident and it
 is I think always important to remind ourselves the humans are fallible thesystems we create as perfect as we
 strive to make them we can always make them better and so another element ofthat culture of mission success is
 really that commitment to continuous improvement if there's something thatgoes wrong a real commitment to root
 cause and true root cause understanding to taking the corrective actions and tomaking the system future systems better
 and certainly we want we strive for you know you know no accidents and if youlook at the record of the commercial
 airline industry as a whole and the commercial aircraft industry as a wholeyou know there's a very nice decaying
 exponential two years now where we have no commercial aircraft accidents at allright and our fatal accidents and all
 so that didn't happen by accident it was through the regulatory agencies FAA theairframe manufacturers really working on
 a system to identify root causes and

0:27:19
Speaker 1 :driving them out so maybe we can take a
 step back and many people are familiar but Lockheed Martin broadly what kind ofcategories of systems are you involved


0:27:33
Speaker 0 :in building you know Lockheed Martin we
 think of ourselves as a company that solves hard mission problems and theoutput of that might be an airplane or
 spacecraft or a helicopter or a radar or something like that but ultimately we'redriven by these you know like what what
 is our customer what is that mission that they need to achieve and so that'swhat drove the sr-71 right how do you
 get pictures of a place where you got sophisticated air defense systems thatare capable of handling any aircraft
 that was out there at the time right so that you know that's what you'll did an

0:28:10
Speaker 1 :sr-71 was build a nice flying camera


0:28:12
Speaker 0 :exactly and make sure it gets out and it
 gets back right and that led ultimately to really the start of the space programin the u.s. as well so now take a step
 back to Lockheed Martin of today and we are you know on the order of 105 yearsold now between Lockheed and Martin the
 two big heritage companies of course were made up with a whole bunch of othercompanies that came in as well General
 Dynamics yeah kind of go down the list today were you can think of us in thisspace of solving mission problems so
 obviously on the aircraft side tactical aircraft building the most advancedfighter aircraft that the world has ever
 seen you know we're up to now several hundred of those delivered buildingalmost a hundred a year and of course
 working on the things that come after that on the space side we are engaged inpretty much every venue of space
 utilization and exploration you can imagine so I mentioned things likenavigation timing GP
 communication satellites missile warning satellites we've built commercialsurveillance satellites we've built
 commercial communication satellites we do civil space so everything from humanexploration to the robotic exploration
 in the outer planets and keep keep going on the space front but I don't you knowa couple other areas I'd like to put out
 we're heavily engaged in building critical defensive systems and so acouple that I'll mention the aegis
 combat system this is basically the integrated air and missile defensesystem for the u.s. and allied fleets
 and so protects you know Carrier Strike groups for example from incomingballistic missile threats aircraft
 threats cruise missile threats and kind of go down the list of the the carriers

0:30:10
Speaker 1 :the fleet that itself is the thing that
 is being protected the carriers aren't serving as a protection for something

0:30:18
Speaker 0 :else well that's that's a little bit of
 a different application we've actually built the version called Aegis ashorewhich is now deployed in a couple of
 places around the world so that same technology I mean basically it can beused to protect either an ocean-going
 fleet or a land-based activity another one the Thad programso Thad this is the theater high
 altitude area defense this is to protect you know relatively broad areas againstsophisticated ballistic missile threats
 and so now you know it's deployed with a lot of us capabilities and now we haveinternational customers that are looking
 to buy that capability as well and so these are systems that defend not justdefend militaries and military
 capabilities but defend population areas we saw you know maybe the first publicuse of these back in the in the first
 Gulf War with the Patriot systems and these are these are the kinds of thingsthat Lockheed Martin delivers and
 there's a lot of stuff that goes with it so think about the radar systems and thesensing systems that cue these the
 command and control systems that decide how you pair a weapon against anincoming threat and then all the human
 and machine interfaces to make sure that they can be operated successfully invery strenuous environments yeah there's


0:31:51
Speaker 1 :a there's some incredible engineering
 that I never find like you but like you said so maybe if we just take a look atLockheed history broadly maybe even
 looking at skunk works what are the biggest most impressive milestones ofinnovations if you look at stealth I
 would have called you crazy if you said that's possible at the time andsupersonic and hypersonic so traveling
 it first of all traveling at the speed of sound is pretty damn fast and thesupersonic and hypersonic three four or
 five times the speed of sound that seems I would also call you crazyif you say you can do that so can you
 tell me how it's possible to do these kinds of things and is there othermilestones and an innovation that's
 going on you can talk about yeah well

0:32:44
Speaker 0 :let me start you know on the skunkworks
 saga and you kind of alluded to it in the beginning and skunk works is as muchidea as a place and so it's driven
 really by Kelly Johnson's 14 principles and I'm not gonna list all 14 of themoff but the idea and this I'm sure will
 resonate with any engineer who's worked on a highly motivated small team beforethe idea that if you can essentially
 have a small team of very capable capable people who want to work onreally hard problems you can do almost
 anything especially if you kind of shield them from bureaucratic influencesif you create very tight relationships
 with your customers so that you have that team and shared vision with thecustomer those are the kinds of things
 that enable the skunkworks to do these these incredible things and you know welisted off a number that you can you
 brought up stuff and I mean this this whole you know I wish I could have seenbeen rich with a ball-bearing you know
 rolling across the desk to a general officer and saying would you like tohave an aircraft that has the radar
 cross-section of this ball bearing probably one of the great you know theleast expensive and most effective
 marketing campaigns in the history of the industry so just for people the not

0:34:08
Speaker 1 :familiar I mean the way you detect
 aircraft does I mean I'm sure there's a lot of ways but radar for a longest timeyeah there's a big blob they peers in
 the radar how do you make a plane disappear so it looks as big as a ballbearing what's involved in technology
 wise there what's the broadly sort of it the stuff you speak about I'll stick to

0:34:32
Speaker 0 :what's in been Rich's but obviously the
 geometry of how radar gets reflected and the kinds of materials that eitherreflect or absorb arcum kind of a couple
 of the critical elements there I mean it's a cat-and-mouse game right I meanyou know radars get better stealth
 capabilities kids better and so it's a it's a really game of continuousimprovement and innovation there I'll
 leave it at that

0:34:59
Speaker 1 :yeah so the idea that something is
 essentially invisible it says quite fascinating but the other one is flyingfast so speed of sound is 750 60 miles
 an hour with this little SuperSonics 3 you know Mach 3 something like that yeah

0:35:19
Speaker 0 :we talked about the supersonic obviously
 and we kind of talked about that is that realm from Mach 1 up through about Mach5 and then hypersonic so you know high
 supersonic speeds would be past Mach 5 and you got to remember I knowLockheed Martin and actually other
 companies have been involved in hypersonic development since the late60s you know you think of everything
 from the x-15 to the Space Shuttle as examples of that I think the differencenow is if you look around the world
 particularly the threat environment that we're in today you're starting to seeyou know publicly folks like the
 Russians and the Chinese saying they have hypersonic weapons capability thatcould threaten us and allied
 capabilities and also basically you know the claims are these could get arounddefensive systems that are out there
 today and so there's a real sense of urgency you hear it from folks like theUndersecretary of defense for research
 and engineering dr. Mike Griffin and others in the department of defense thathypersonics is is something that's
 really important to the nation in terms of both parody but alsodefensive capabilities and so that's
 something that you know we're pleased it's something Lockheed Martin's youknow had a heritage in we've invested
 Hardie dollars on our side for many years and we have a number of thingsgoing on with various US government
 customers in that field today that we're very excited about so I I wouldanticipate we'll be hearing more about
 that in the future from our customers

0:37:06
Speaker 1 :and I've actually haven't read much
 about this probably you can't talk about much of it at all but on the defensiveside it's the fascinating problem of


0:37:15
Speaker 0 :perception of trying to detect things


0:37:16
Speaker 1 :that are really hard to see can you
 comment on how hard that problem is and how how hard is it to stay ahead even ifwe go back a few decades stay ahead of


0:37:30
Speaker 0 :the competition well maybe I again you
 got to think of these as ongoing the capability development and so think backto the early days of missile defense so
 this would be in the 80s the SDI program and in that timeframe we proved inLockheed Martin proof that you could hit
 a bullet with a bullet essentially and which is something that had never beendone before to take out an incoming
 ballistic missile and so that's led to these incredible hit-to-kill kinds ofcapabilities pac-3 that's the Patriot
 advanced capability model 3 the Lockheed Martin builds the THAAD system that Ithat I talked about
 so now hypersonics you know they're different from ballistic systems and sowe got to take the next step in
 defensive capability I can leave that

0:38:23
Speaker 1 :there but I can only imagine you know
 let me just comment sort of Resident Engineer it's sad to know that so muchthat Lockheed has done in the past is
 classified or today you know and it's shrouded in secrecy it has to be by thenature of the application so like what I
 do so we what we do here at MIT would like to inspire youngyears young scientists and yet in a
 lucky case some of that engineering has to stay quiet how do you think aboutthat how does that make you feel is
 there a future where more can be shown or is it just the nature the nature ofthis world that has to remain secret


0:39:13
Speaker 0 :it's a good question I think the public
 can see enough of including students who may be in grade school high schoolcollege today to understand the kinds of
 really hard problems that we work on and I mean look at the f-35 right and youknow obviously a lot of the detailed
 performance levels are sensitive and control but you know we can talk aboutwhat an incredible aircraft this is you
 know supersonic super cruise kind of a fighter a a you know stealthcapabilities it's a flying information
 you know system in the sky with data fusion sensor fusion capabilities thathave never been seen before
 so these are the kinds of things that I believe you know there was these arekinds of things that got me excited when
 I was a student I think these still inspire students today and the otherthing and say I mean you know people are
 inspired by space people are inspired by aircraft our employees are also inspiredby that sense of mission and I will just
 give you an example I had the privilege to work and lead our GPS programs forsome time and that was a case where he
 actually worked on a program that touches billions of people every day andso when I said I worked on GPS everybody
 knew what I was talking about even though they didn't maybe appreciate thetechnical challenges that went into that
 but I'll tell you I got a briefing one time from a major in the Air Forceand he said I go by callsign [ __ ] GPS is
 my passion yeah I love GPS and he was involved in the operational test of thesystem he said when I was out in Iraq
 and I was on a helicopter Black Hawk helicopter and it was bringing back youknow sergeant and handful of troops from
 a deployed location and I you know I said my job is GPS I asked that sergeanthe's you know beaten down and kind of
 half asleep and I said what do you think about GPS and he brightened up his eyeslit up and he said well GPS that brings
 me and my troops home every day I love GPS and that's the kind of storywhere it's like okay I'm really making a
 difference here in the kind of work so that that mission piece is reallyimportant the last thing I'll say is
 that and this gets to some of these questions around advanced technologiesit's not you know they're not just
 airplanes and spacecraft anymore for people who are excited about advancedsoftware capabilities about AI about
 bringing machine learn the things that we're doing to you know exponentiallyincrease the mission capabilities that
 go on those platforms and those are the kinds of things I think are more andmore visible to the public yeah I think


0:42:18
Speaker 1 :autonomy especially in flight is super
 exciting do you do you see if a day here we go back into philosophy future whenmost fighter jets will be highly
 autonomous to a degree where a human doesn't need to be in the cockpit inalmost all cases well I mean that's a


0:42:41
Speaker 0 :world that to a certain extent we're in
 today now these are remotely piloted aircraft to be sure but but we havehundreds of thousands of flight hours a
 year now in remotely piloted aircraft and then if you take the f-35 there Imean there are huge layers I guess in
 levels of autonomy built into that aircraftso that the pilot is essentially more of
 a mission manager rather than doing the data you know the second second elementsof flying the aircrafts on in some ways
 it's the easiest aircraft in the world to fly and kind of funny story on thatso I don't know if you know how aircraft
 carrier landings work but basically there's what's called a tail hook and itcatches wires on the deck of the carrier
 and that's what brings the the aircraft to a screeching halt Britain and there'stypically three of these wires so if you
 miss the first the second one you catch the the next one right and you know wegot a little criticism I don't know how
 true this story is what we got a little criticism the f-35 is so perfect italways gets the second wires we're
 wearing out the wire I guess it always hits that one so that but that's thekind of autonomy that just makes these
 that essentially up levels what the human is doing two more that missionmanagers so much of that landing by that


0:44:09
Speaker 1 :thirty-five is autonomous well it's just


0:44:12
Speaker 0 :you know the control systems are such
 that you really have dialed out the variability and what that comes with allthe environmental condition wearing it
 out so my point is to certain extent that world is here today do I think thatwe're gonna see a day anytime soon when
 there are no humans in the cockpit I don't believe that but I do think we'regonna see much more human machine
 teaming and we're gonna see that much more at the tactical edge and we did ademo you asked about what the skunkworks
 is doing these days and so this is what something I can talk about but we did ademo with the Air Force Research
 Laboratory or laboratory we called it have Rader and so using an f-16as an autonomous wingman and we
 demonstrated all kinds of maneuvers and verus mission scenarios with theautonomous f-16 being that so-called
 loyal or trusted wingman and so those are the kinds of things that you knowwe've shown what is possible now given
 that you've up leveled that pilot to be a mission manager now they can controlmultiple other aircraft they can almost
 as extensions of your own aircraft flying alongside with you so that'sthat's another example of how this is
 really coming to fruition and then yeah I mentioned the the landings but thinkabout just the implications for humans
 and flight safety and this goes a little bit back to the discussion we werehaving about how do you continuously
 improve the level of safety through automation while working through thecomplexities that Automation introduces
 so one of the challenges that you have in high-performance fighter aircraft iswhat's called G lock so this is G
 induced loss of consciousness so you pull 9 G's you're wearing a pressuresuit that's not enough to keep the blood
 going to your brain you have a blackout right right and of course that's bad ifyou happen to be flying low you know
 near the deck and you know earng obstacle or terrain environment and sowe developed the system and our
 Aeronautics division called Auto G caso autonomous ground collision avoidancesystem and we built that into the f-16
 it's actually saved seven aircraft eight pilots already and a relatively shorttime it's been deployed it was so
 successful that the Air Force said hey we need to have this in the f-35 rightaway so we've actually gone done testing
 and that now on the f-35 and we've also integrated an autonomous air collisionavoidance system so I think the
 air-to-air problem so now it's the integrated collision avoidance systembut these are the kinds of capabilities
 you know I wouldn't call them a high I mean they're very sophisticated modelsyou know of the aircraft dynamics
 coupled with the terrain models to be able to predict when essentially thepilot is doing something that is going
 to take the aircraft into or the pilots not doing something in this case butthose it just gives you an example of
 how autonomy can be really a lifesaver in today's world it's like a autonomous

0:47:26
Speaker 1 :emerges automated emergency braking in
 cars but is there any exploration of perception of for example detecting Glock that the pilot has is out so as
 opposed to perceiving the external environment to infer that the pilot isout but actually perceiving the Pala
 directly yeah this is one of those cases

0:47:47
Speaker 0 :where you'd like to you know not take
 action if you think the pilots there and it's almost like systems that try todetect if a drivers falling asleep on
 the road right with limited success so I mean this is what I call the system oflast resort right where if the if the
 aircraft has determined that it's going into the terrainget it out of there and and this is not
 something that we're just doing in the in the aircraft world and I wanted tohighlight we have a technology we call
 matrix but this is developed at sikorsky innovations the whole idea there is whatwe call optimal piloting so not optional
 piloting or unpiloted but optimal piloting so an FAA certified system soyou have a high degree of confidence
 it's generally pretty deterministic so if we know that I'll do in differentsituations but effectively be able to
 fly mission with two pilots one pilot no pilots and and have if you can think ofit almost as like a dial of the level of
 autonomy that you want but able so it's running in the background at all timesand able to pick up tasks whether it's
 you know sort of autopilot kinds of tasks or more sophisticated pathplanning kinds of activities to be able
 to do things like for example land on an oil rigyou know in the North Sea in bad weather
 zero zero conditions and you can imagine of course there's a lot of militaryutility to capability like that you know
 you could have an aircraft that you want to send out for a crewed mission butthen in the at night if you want to use
 it to deliver supplies in an unmanned mode that that could be done as well andso there's there's there's clear
 advantages there but think about on the commercial side you know if you're anaircraft taking you're gonna fly out to
 this oil rig if you get out there and you can't land then you gotta bring allthose people back reschedule another
 flight pay the overtime for the crew that you just brought back because theydidn't get where they're gonna pay for
 the or for the folks that are out there and the oil rig this is real economicyou know these are dollars and cents
 kinds of advantages we're bringing in the commercial world as well so this is

0:50:07
Speaker 1 :a difficult question from the a space
 that I would love it if we're able to comment so a lot of this autonomy in AIyou've mentioned just now as this
 empowering effect that one is the last resort it keeps you safe the other isthere's a with the teaming and in
 general assistive assistive AI and I think there's a there's always a race sothe world is full of the world is
 complex it's full of bad actors so there's there's often a race to makesure that we keep this this country safe
 right but with AI there is a concern as a slightly different race there's a lotof people in the eye space they're
 concerned about the AI arms race that as opposed to you the United Statesbecoming you know having the best
 technology and therefore keeping us safe we even we loose ability to keep controlof it so this the AI arms race getting
 away from all of us humans so do you share this worry do you share thisconcern when we're talking about
 military applications that too much control and decision-making capabilitiesgiving too
 after AI well I don't see it happening

0:51:31
Speaker 0 :today and in fact this is something from
 a policy perspective you know it's obviously a very dynamic space but theDepartment of Defense has put quite a
 bit of thought into that and maybe before talking about the policy I'lljust talk about some of the why and you
 alluded to it being a sort of a complicated and a little bit scary worldout there but there's some big things
 happening today you hear a lot of talk now about a return to great powerscompetition particularly around China
 and Russia with the US but there are some other big players out there as welland what we've seen is the deployment of
 some very I'd say concerning new weapon systems you know particularly withRussia and breaching some of the irbm
 intermediate range ballistic missile treaties that's been in the news a lotyou know the building of Islands
 artificial islands in the South China Sea by the Chinese and then arming thoseIslands the annexation of Crimea by
 Russia and the invasion of Ukraine and so there's there's some pretty scarythings and then you add on top of that
 the North Korean threat has certainly not gone away there's a lot going on inthe Middle East with Iran in particular
 and we see this global terrorism threat has not abated right so there are a lotof reasons to look for technology to
 assist with those problems whether it's AI or other technologies like hypersonicsearch which we discussed so now let me
 give just a couple of hypotheticals so people react sort of in the secondtimeframe right you know your photon
 hitting your eye - you know movement is you know on the order of a few tenths ofa second kinds of processing times
 roughly speaking you know computers are operating in the Nanosecond timescale right so just to bring
 home what that means a nanosecond to a second is like a second to 32 years soseconds on the battlefield in that sense
 literally our lifetimes and so if you can bring in autonomous or AI enabledcapability that will enable the human to
 shrink maybe you've heard the term the Gouda loop so this whole idea that atypical battlefield decision is
 characterized by observe so information comes in orient how does that what doesthat mean in the context decide what do
 I do about it and then act take that action if you can use these capabilitiesto compress that Oda loop to stay inside
 what your adversary is doing that's an incredible powerful force on thebattlefield that's a really nice way to


0:54:38
Speaker 1 :put it at the role of AI and competing
 in general has a lot to benefit from just decreasing from thirty two years toone second as opposed to on the scale of
 seconds and minutes and hours making decisions that humans are better atthinking and it actually goes the other


0:54:53
Speaker 0 :way too so that's on the short timescale
 so humans kind of work in the you know one second two seconds to eight hoursafter eight hours you get tired you know
 you gotta go to the bathroom whatever the case might be so there's this wholerange of other things think about you
 know surveillance and guarding you know facilities think about moving materiallogistics sustainment a lot of these
 what they called old dirty and dangerous things that you need to have sustainedactivity but it's sort of beyond the
 length of time that a human can practically do as well so there's thisthis range of things that are critical
 in military and defense applications that AI and autonomy are particularlywell suited to now the interesting
 question that you brought up is okay how do you make sure that stays within humancontrol net so that was the context for
 now the policy and so there is a DoD directive called 3009 because that's theway we name stuff in this world and and
 but it you know and I'd say it's well worth reading it's only a couple pageslong but it makes some key points and
 it's really around you know making sure there's human agency and control overuse of semi autonomous and autonomous
 weapon systems making sure that these systems are tested verified andevaluated in realistic real world type
 scenarios making sure that the people are actually trained on how to use themmaking sure the systems have
 human-machine interfaces that can show what state they're in and what kinds ofdecisions they're making making sure
 that you establish doctrine and tactics and techniques and procedures for theuse of these kinds of systems and so
 right and by the way I mean the this none of this is easy but it I'm justtrying to lay kind of the picture of how
 the US has said this is the way we're going to treat AI and autonomous systemsthat it's not a free-for-all and like
 there are rules of war and rules of engagement with other kinds of systemsthink chemical weapons biological
 weapons we need to think about the same sorts of implications and this issomething that's really important for
 Lockheed Martin I obviously we are 100% complying with our customer and thepolicies and regulations but I mean AI
 is an incredible enabler say within the walls of Lockheed Martin in terms ofimproving production efficiency and
 doing helping engineers doing generative design improving logistics driving downenergy costs I mean there's so many
 application but we're you know we had we're alsovery interested in so many elements of
 ethical application you know within Lockheed Martin so we need to make surethat things like privacy is is taken
 care of that we do everything we can to drive out bias in AI enabled kinds ofsystems that we make sure that humans
 are involved in decisions that were not just delegating accountability toalgorithms and so it for us you know it
 all comes back I talked about culture before and it comes back to sort of theLockheed Martin culture and our core
 values and so it's pretty simple for us and do what's right respect othersperform with excellence and now how do
 we tie that back to the ethical principles of will govern how AI is usedwithin Lockheed Martin and we actually
 have a world so you might not know this but they're actually awards for ethicsprograms Lockheed Martin's had a
 recognized ethics program for many years and this is one of the things that ourethics team is working with our
 engineering team on

0:58:48
Speaker 1 :one of the miracles to me perhaps a
 layman again I was born in the Soviet Union so that I have echoes at least inmy family history of World War two and
 the Cold War give a sense of why human civilization has not destroyed itselftheir nuclear war so nuclear deterrence
 and the thinking about the future there's this technology of a role toplay here and what is the long-term
 future of nuclear deterrence look like

0:59:20
Speaker 0 :yeah it's you know this is one of those
 hard hard questions and I should note that Lockheed Martin is you know bothproud and privileged to play a part in
 multiple legs of our nuclear and strategic deterrent systems like theTrident submarine launched ballistic
 missiles you know you talk about you know is there still a possibility thehuman race could destroy itself I'd say
 that possibility is real but interestingly in some sense I think thestrategic deterrence have prevented the
 kinds of you know incredibly destruct the world wars that we saw in the firsthalf of the 20th century now things have
 gotten more complicated since that time and since the Cold War is more of amultipolar great powers world today just
 to give you an example back then you know there were you know in the in theCold War timeframe just a handful of
 nations that had ballistic missile capability by last count and this is afew years old there's over 70 nations
 today that have that similar kinds of numbers in terms of space-basedcapabilities so so the world has gotten
 more complex and more challenging and the threats I think have proliferated inways that we didn't expect
 you know the the nation today is in the middle of a recapitalization of ourstrategic deterrent I look at that as
 one of the most important things that our nation can do what is involved in

1:01:01
Speaker 1 :deterrence is it is it being ready to
 attack or is it the defensive systems that catch attacks a little bit of both

1:01:11
Speaker 0 :and so it's a complicated game
 theoretical kind of program but ultimately we are trying to prevent theuse of any of these weapons and the
 theory behind prevention is that even if an adversary uses a weapon against youyou have the capability to essentially
 strike back and do harm to them that's unacceptableand so that will deter them from you
 know making use of these weapon systems the deterrence calculus has changed ofcourse with you know more nations now
 having these kinds of weapons but I think you know from my perspective it'svery important you know to maintain a
 strategic deterrent you have to have systems that you will know you know willwork when they're required to work you
 know that they have to be adaptable to a variety of different scenarios intoday's world and so that's what this
 recapitalization of systems that were built over in previous decades makingsure that they are appropriate not just
 for today but for the decades to come so the other thing I'd really like to noteis strategic deterrence has a very
 different character today you know we used to think of weapons of massdestruction in terms of nuclear chemical
 biological and today we have a cyber threat we've seen examples of the use ofcyber weaponry and if you think about
 the possibilities of using cyber capabilities or an adverseattacking the us to take out things like
 critical infrastructure electrical grids water systems those are scenarios thatare strategic in nature to the survival
 of a nation as well so that is the kind of world that we live in today and youknow part of my hope on this is one that
 we can also develop technical or technological systems perhaps enabled bya and athon imme that will allow us to
 contain and to fight back against these kinds of new threats that were notconceived when we first developed our
 strategic deterrence yeah I know that

1:03:47
Speaker 1 :Lockheed is involved in cyber I saw I
 studied that you mentioned that it's an incredibly a nuclear almost seems easierthan cyber because there's so many
 attack by there's so many ways that cyber can evolve it's such an uncertainfuture but talking about engineering
 with the mission I mean in this case that you're engineering systems thatbasically saved the world


1:04:14
Speaker 0 :well like like I said we were privileged
 to deuce to work on some very challenging problems for for verycritical customers here in the US and
 with our allies abroad as well Lockheed bills both military and

1:04:27
Speaker 1 :non-military systems and perhaps the
 future of Lockheed may be more in non-military applications if you talkabout space and beyond I see that as a
 preface to a difficult question so President Eisenhower in 1961 in hisfarewell address talked about the
 military-industrial complex and that it shouldn't grow beyond what is needed sowhat are your thoughts on those words on
 the military-industrial complex on the concern of growth of their developmentsbeyond what may be needed that what


1:05:06
Speaker 0 :where it may be needed is a critical
 phrase of course and and I think it is worth pointing outas you noted that Lockheed Martin we are
 in a number of commercial businesses from energy to space to commercialaircraft and so I wouldn't and I
 wouldn't neglect the importance of those parts of our business as well I thinkthe world is dynamic and you know there
 was a time it doesn't seem that long ago to me it was I was a graduate studenthere at MIT and we were talking about
 the peace dividend at the end of the Cold War if you look at expenditure onmilitary systems as a fraction of GDP
 were far below peak levels of the past and to me at least it looks like a timewhere you're seeing global threats
 changing in a way that would warrant you know relevant relevant investmentsin defense defensive capabilities the
 other thing I'd note for military and defensive systems it's it's not quite afree market right we don't sell to you
 know people on the street and that warrants a very close partnershipbetween I'd say the customers and the
 people that design build and maintain these systems because of the very uniquenature the the very difficult
 requirements the very great importance on you know safety and then you knowoperating the way they're intended every
 time and so that does create and it's frankly it's one of Lockheed Martin'sgreat strengths is that we have this
 expertise built up over many years in partnership with our customers to beable to design and build these systems
 that meet these very unique mission needsyeah because building those system is


1:07:12
Speaker 1 :very costly it's very little room for
 mistake I mean it's yeah just been Rich's book and so on just tells thestory it's never I can just reading it
 if you're an engineer it's reads like a thriller okaylet me let's go back to space for say
 I guess I'm always happy to go back to

1:07:31
Speaker 0 :space so a few quick may be out there a


1:07:34
Speaker 1 :fun questions maybe a little provocative
 what are your thoughts on the efforts of the new folks SpaceX and you know muskwhat are your thoughts about what Elon
 is doing you see Miss competition do you enjoy a competition Oh what areyour thoughts yeah first of all


1:07:57
Speaker 0 :certainly you on
 I'd say SpaceX and some of the and some of those other ventures are definitely acompetitive force in the in the space
 industry and do we like competition yeah we doand we think we're very strong
 competitors I think it's yeah competition is what the US is founded onand in a lot of ways and always coming
 up with a better way and I I think it's really important to continue you knowhave fresh eyes coming in new innovation
 I do think it's important to have level playing fields and so you want to makesure that that you're not giving
 different requirements to different players but you know I tell people youknow I spent a lot of time he places
 like MIT I'm going to be at the MIT beaver work Summer Institute over theweekend here and I tell people this is
 the most exciting time to be in the space business in my entire life and itis this explosion of new capabilities
 that have been driven by things like the you know the massive increase incomputing power things like the massive
 increase in comms capabilities advanced and additive manufacturing are arereally bringing down the barriers to
 entry in this field and it's driving just incredible innovation and it'shappening at startups but it's also
 happening at Lockheed Martin may not realize this but Lockheed Martin workingwith Stanford actually built the first
 cubes that was launched here out of the u.s. that was called quakes and we didthat with stellar solutions this
 right around just after 2000 I guess and so we've been in that you know from thevery beginning and you know I I talked
 about some of these like you know Maya and Orion but you know we're in themiddle of what we call smart sets and
 software-defined satellites that can essentially restructure and re map theirpurpose their mission on orbit to give
 you almost unlimited flexibility for these satellites over their lifetimes sothose are just a couple of examples but
 yeah this this is a great time to be in space absolutely

1:10:14
Speaker 1 :so Wright brothers flew for the first
 time 116 years ago so now we have supersonic stealth planes and all thetechnology we've talked about what
 innovations obviously you can't predict the future but do you see Lockheed inthe next hundred years if you take that
 same leap how will the world of technology engineering change I knowit's an impossible question but nobody
 could have predicted that we could even fly a hundred and twenty years ago sowhat do you think is the edge of
 possibility that we're going to be exploring the next I don't know that

1:10:53
Speaker 0 :there is an edge I you know we've been
 around for almost that entire time right the Lockheed brothers and Glenn L Martinstarting their companies you know
 basement of a church and a old you know service station we're very differentcompanies today than we were back then
 right and that's because we've continuously reinvented ourselves overthe all of those decades I think it's
 fair to say yeah I know this for sure the world of the future it's going tomove faster it's going to be more
 connected it's going to be more autonomous and it's going to be morecomplex than it is today
 and so this is the world you know as a CTL Lockheed Martin that I think aboutwhat are the technologies that we have
 to invest in whether it's things like AI and autonomy you know you can thinkabout quantum computing which is an area
 that we've invested in to try to stay of these technological changes andfrankly some of the threats that are out
 there I mean I believe that we're going to be out there in the solar system thatwe're gonna be defending and defending
 well against probably you know military threats that nobody has even thoughtabout today we are going to be we're
 going to use these capabilities to have far greater knowledge of our own planetthe depths of the oceans you know all
 the way to the upper reaches the atmosphere and everything out to the Suninto the edge of the solar system so so
 that's what I look forward to and I I'm excited I mean just looking ahead in thenext decade or so to the steps that I
 see ahead of us in that time I don't think there's a better place to end K

1:12:37
Speaker 1 :okay thank you so much
