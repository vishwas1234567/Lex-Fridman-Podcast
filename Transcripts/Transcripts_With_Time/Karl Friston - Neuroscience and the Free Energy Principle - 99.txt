 with Carl Fuerst --an how much of the human brain do we understand from thelow level of neuronal communication to
 the functional level to the to the highest level maybe the the psychiatric

0:02:03
Speaker 1 :disorder level well we're certainly in a
 better position than we were last centuryhow far we've got to go I think is
 almost an unanswerable question so you'd have to set the parameters you know whatconstitutes understanding what level of
 understanding do you want I think we've made enormous progress in terms ofbroad-brush principles whether that
 affords a detailed cartography of the functional anatomy of the brain and whathe doesn't write down to the
 microcircuitry in the neurons that's probably out of reach at the present

0:02:41
Speaker 0 :time so the cartography so mapping the
 brain do you think mapping of the brain the detailed perfect imaging of it doesthat get us
 closer to understanding of the mind of the brain so how far does it get us ifwe have the perfect cartography of the


0:03:00
Speaker 1 :brain I think there are lower bounds on
 that it's a really interesting question you and it would determine this sort ofscientific career you'd pursue if you
 believe that knowing every dendritic connection every sort of microscopicsynaptic structure and right down to the
 molecular level was gonna give you the right kind of information to understandthe computational Natale then you choose
 to be microscopic and you would study little cubic millimeters of brain forthe rest of your life if on the other
 hand you were interested in holistic functions and a sort of functionalanatomy of the sort that a
 neuropsychologist would understand you'd study brain lesions and strokes you knowjust looking at the whole person so
 again it comes back to I won't level do you want understanding I think there areprincipled reasons not to go too far if
 you commit to a view of the brain as a machine that's performing a form ofinference and representing things there
 are the understanding that level our understanding is necessarily cast interms of probability densities and
 ensemble densities distributions and what that tells you isthat you don't really want to look at
 the atoms to understand the thermodynamics of probabilisticdescriptions for how the brain works so
 I personally wouldn't look at the molecules or indeed the single neuronsin the same way if I wanted and
 understand the thermodynamics of some non equilibrium steady state of a gas oran active material I wouldn't spend my
 life looking at the the individual molecules that constituted there onsomebody look at their collective
 behavior on the other hand if you go to coarse grain you're gonna miss somebasic canonical principles of
 connectivity and architectures I'm thinking here this bitkha local but thiscurrent excitement about high field
 magnetic resonance imaging and seven tests that why well it gives us for thefirst time the opportunity to look at
 the brain in action at the level of a few millimeters that distinguish betweendifferent layers of the cortex that may
 be very important in terms of evincing generic principles of canonicalmicrocircuitry that are replicated
 throughout the brain there may tell us something fundamental about messagepassing in the brain and these density
 dynamics of on your own ensemble population dynamics that underwrite ouryou know our brain function so somewhere
 between a millimeter and a meter

0:05:53
Speaker 0 :lingering for a bit under and the big
 questions if you allow me what to you is the most beautiful or surprisingcharacteristic of the human brain


0:06:02
Speaker 1 :I think it's hierarchical and recursive
 aspect is recurrent aspect of the

0:06:08
Speaker 0 :structure or of the actual
 representation of power of the brain

0:06:11
Speaker 1 :well I think one speaks to the other
 I was actually answering in adèle minded way from the point of view of purely itsanatomy and and its structural aspects I
 mean there are many marvelous organs in them in the bodylet's take your liver for example you
 know without it you wouldn't you wouldn't be around for very long and hedoes some
 beautiful delicate by chemistry and homeostasis and you're evolved with afinesse that would easily parallel the
 brain but he doesn't have a beautiful Anatomyhe has a simple atomy which is
 attractive in a minimalist sense but it doesn't have that crafted structure ofsparse connectivity and that recurrence
 and that specialization that the brain

0:06:55
Speaker 0 :has so you said a lot of interesting
 terms here so the recurrence the sparsity but you also started by sayinghierarchical mm-hmm so I've I've never
 thought of our brain as hierarchical sort of I always thought is just like agiant mess an interconnected mess was
 very difficult to figure anything out but in what sense do you see the brain

0:07:20
Speaker 1 :is hierarchical well I see it's not a
 magic soup yeah of course it's what I used to think when I was before Istudied medicine and the like so a lot
 of those terms imply each other so hierarchies if you just think about thenature of a hierarchy how would you
 actually build one and what you would have to do is basically carefully removethe right connections that destroy the
 completely connected soups that you might have in mind so a hierarchy is inand of itself defined by a sparse and
 particular connectivity structure I'm not committing to any particular form of

0:08:07
Speaker 0 :hierarchy the your senses there is some


0:08:09
Speaker 1 :oh absolutely in virtue of the fact that
 there is a sparsity of connectivity not necessarily of a quality it's obviousand if a quantitative sort so they are
 it is demonstrably so and that they've far further apart two parts of the brainare the less likely that they are to be
 wired you know to possess axonal processes neuronal processes thatdirectly communicate one message or
 messages from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain so we knowthere's a sparse connectivity
 and furthermore on the basis of anatomical connectivity and tracesstudies we know that that a that has
 that sparsity under writes a higher high rock on a very structured sort ofconnectivity that might be best
 understood like a little bit like an onion you know that there there is aconcentric sometimes refer to as
 centripetal by people like Marcel mess ulam hierarchical organization to thebrain so you can think of the brain as
 in a rough sense like an onion and all the sensory information and all theafferent outgoing messages that supply
 commands to your muscles or to your secrete ryokans come from the surface sothere's a massive exchange interface
 with the world out there on the surface and then underneath there's a littlelayer that sits and looks at the
 exchange on the surface and then underneath that there's a layer rightthere way down to the very center
 through the deepest part of the onion that's what I mean by a mirrorhierarchical organization there's a
 discernible structure defined by the sparsity of connections that lends thearchitecture a hierarchical structure
 that tells one a lot about the kinds of representations and messages so karateon any question is this about the
 representational capacity or is it about the anatomywell one under writes the other you know
 if one this simply thinks of the brain as a message passing machine a processthat is in the service of doing
 something then the the circuitry and the connectivity that shape that messagepassing also dictate its function so


0:10:42
Speaker 0 :you've done a lot of amazing work in a
 lot of directions so let's look at one aspect of that of looking into the brainand trying to study this onion structure
 of what can we learn about the brain by imaging it which is one way to sort oflook at the anatomy of it broadly
 speaking what what are the methods of imaging but even bigger what can we

0:11:06
Speaker 1 :learn about it right so well most
 imaging human neural imaging you might see you know in science journals thespeaks to the way the brain works
 measures brain activity over time so you know that's the first thing to say theway we're effectively looking at
 fluctuations in neuronal responses usually in response to some sensoryinput or some instruction some task not
 necessarily and there's a lot of interest in just looking at the brain interms of resting state endogenous or
 intrinsic activity but crucially at every point looking at thesefluctuations either induced or intrinsic
 in the neural activity and understanding them at two levels so normally peoplewould recourse to two principles of
 brain or kin organization that are complimentary one functionalspecialization or segregation so what
 does that mean it simply means that there are certain parts of the brainthat may be specialized for certain
 kinds of processing you know for example visual motion our ability to recognizeor to perceive movement in the visual
 world and furthermore that specialized processing may be spatially oranatomically segregated leading to
 functional segregation which means that if I were to compare your brain activityduring a period of studying viewing a
 static image and then compare that to the responses of fluctuations in thebrain when you are exposed to a moving
 image say a flying bird eirick we would expect to see restrictedsegregated differences in activity and
 those are basically the hot spots that you see in me in surgical parametricmaps that test for the significance of
 the responses that are circumscribed so now basically we're talking about somepeople of perhaps and currently Calder
 and neocartography this is a phrenology augmented by modern day near imagingbasically finding blobs or bumps on the
 brain that do this or do that and trying to understand the cartography of thatfunctional specialization so how much


0:13:35
Speaker 0 :how much is there such this is such a
 beautiful sort of ideal to strive for we we humans scientists would like you likethis to hope that there is a beautiful
 structure to this was like you said there are segregated regions that areresponsible for the different function
 how much hope is there to find such regions in terms of looking at theprogress of studying the brain oh I


0:14:00
Speaker 1 :think in Nomis progress has been made in
 the past you know 20 or 30 years you know so this is beyond incremental youknow at the advent of brain imaging the
 very notion of functional segregation was just a hypothesis based upon acentury if not more of careful
 neuropsychology looking at people who had lost via insult or traumatic braininjury particular parts of the brain and
 then saying well they can't do this or they can't do that for example losingthe visual cortex and not being able to
 see or using losing particular parts of the visual cortex or regions known as v5or the middle temporal region MT
 noticing that they selectively could not see moving things and so that createdthe the hypothesis that perhaps movement
 processing visual movement processing was located in this functionallysegregated area and you could then put
 go and put invasive electrodes in animal models and say yes indeed we can exciteactivity here we can form receptive
 fields that are sensitive to or defined in terms of visual motion but at nopoint could you exclu the possibility
 that everywhere else in the brain was also very interested in visual motion by

0:15:22
Speaker 0 :the way I apologize to interrupt buzz
 tiny little tangent you said animal models just out of curiosity from yourperspective how different is the human
 brain versus the other animals in terms of our ability to study the brain well

0:15:38
Speaker 1 :clearly the far further away you go from
 a human brain the the greater the difference is but not not as remarkableas you might think so people will choose
 their level of approximation to the human brain depending upon the otherkinds of questions that they want to
 answer so if you're talking about sort of canonical principles ofmicrocircuitry it might be perfectly
 okay to look at a mouse indeed you could even look at flies worms if on the otherhand you wanted to look at the finer
 details of organization of visual cortex and v1 v2 there's a designated sort ofpatches of cortex that may or may do
 different things indeed do you probably want to use a primate that looked alittle bit more like a human because
 there are lots of ethical issues in terms of you know the use of non-humanprimates to transfer questions about the
 about human anatomy I think most people assume that the most of the importantprinciples are conserved in a continuous
 way you know from right from well yes worms right to yummy

0:16:52
Speaker 0 :so now returning to so that was the
 early of ideas are studying the the the really functional regions of the brainbase if there's some damage to it to try
 to infer that there's that part of the brain might be somewhat responsible forthis type of function so what where does
 that lead us what are the next steps

0:17:12
Speaker 1 :beyond that right well this actually
 reverse a bit come back to your sort of notion that the brain is a magic sue butthat was actually a very prominent idea
 at one point notions such as Lashley's law of mass action inherited from theobservation that for serve
 animals if you just took out spoonfuls of the brain it didn't matter where youtook these spoonfuls out they always
 showed the same kinds of deficits so you know it was very difficult to inferfunctional specialization pure on the
 base basis of lesion deficit studies but once we had the opportunity to look onthe brain or lighting up in its it's
 literally it's sort of excitement neuronal AM excitement when looking atthis versus that one was able to say yes
 indeed these functionally specialized responsesare very restricted and then they're
 here or they're over there if I do this then this part of the brain lights upand that became doable in the early 90s
 in fact shortly before with the advent of positron emission tomography and thenfunctional magnetic resonance imaging
 came along in the early 90s and since that time there has been an explosion ofdiscovery refinement confirmation you
 know there are people who believe that it's all in the anatomy if youunderstand the anatomy then you
 understand the function at some level and many many hypotheses were predicatedon a deep understanding of the anatomy
 and the connectivity but they were all confirmed and taking much further withnewer imaging so that's what I meant by
 we've made an enormous amount of progress in in this century indeed andin relation to the previous century by
 looking at these funky selective responses but that wasn't the wholestory so there's a sort of near
 phrenology but finding bumps and hotspots in the brain that did this orthat the bigger question was of course
 the functional integration how all of these regionally specific responses wereorchestrated how they were distributed
 how did they relate to distributed processing and indeed representations inthe brain so then you turn to the more
 challenging issue of the integration the connectivity and then we come back tothis beautiful sparse recurrent
 hierarchical connectivity that seems characteristic of the brain and probablynot many other organs and but


0:19:53
Speaker 0 :nevertheless we'll come back to this
 this challenge of trying to figure out how everything is integrated but what'syour feeling what's the general
 consensus how we moved away from the magic soup view of the brain yes sothere is a deep structure to it yeah
 that and then maybe further question you said some people believe that thestructure is most of it that you can
 really get at the core of the function by just deeply understanding thestructure yeah where do you sit on that
 do you

0:20:24
Speaker 1 :I think it's called some monster yes


0:20:28
Speaker 0 :yeah yes it's a worthy pursuit of going
 of studying of through imaging and all the different methods to actually study

0:20:36
Speaker 1 :no absolutely let's go yeah yeah sorry
 I'm just I'm just nutty you you you were accusing me of using lots of long wordsand then you introduce one that which is
 deep which is interesting and because deep is this or Millenial equivalent ofhierarchical so if you've put a deep in
 front of anything you're very millennial and starttrending but you yes you're also
 implying a hierarchical architecture so that's it is a depth which is for me the

0:21:04
Speaker 0 :beautiful thing that's right the word
 deep kind of yeah exactly it implies hierarchy I didn't even think about thatthat indeed the implicit meaning of the
 word deep is a hierarchy yep yeah yeah

0:21:17
Speaker 1 :so deep inside the onion is a central


0:21:21
Speaker 0 :view so if you put maybe briefly if you
 could paint a picture of the kind of methods of neuro imaging maybe thehistory which you are a part of you know
 from statistical parametric mapping I mean just what what's out there that'sinteresting for people maybe outside the
 field that to understand of what are the actual methodologies of looking inside

0:21:44
Speaker 1 :the human brain right well there you can
 answer that question from two perspectives basically it's the modalityyou know what kind of signal are you
 measuring and they can range from and let's limit ourselves to some imagingbased non-invasive
 techniques so you've essentially got brain scanners and Brent's cannons caneither measure the structural attributes
 the amount of water of the Mount of fat on the amount of iron in different partsof the brain you can make lots of
 inferences about the structure of the organ of the sort that you might haveabuse from an x-ray but a you know a
 very nuanced x-ray that is looking at this kind of property of that kind ofproperty so looking at the anatomy not
 invasively is would be the first sort of earnerimaging that people might want to employ
 then you move on to the kinds of measurements that reflect dynamicfunction the most prevalent of those
 fall into two camps you've got these metabolic sometimes hemodynamic bloodrelated signals so these metabolic
 and/or hemodynamic signals are basic proxies for elevated activity andmessage passing and neuronal dynamics in
 particular parts of the brain characteristically though the timeconstants of these hemodynamic or
 metabolic responses to neural activity are much longer than the neural activity

0:23:15
Speaker 0 :itself and this is uh this is refering
 forgive me for the dumb questions but this would be referring to blood likethe flow of blood absolutely
 so there's a ton of it seems like there's a ton of blood vessels in thebrain yeah so but what's the interaction
 between the flow of blood and the function of the new and neurons is there

0:23:37
Speaker 1 :an interplay there or yeah yeah yeah and
 that interplay accounts for several careers of world-renown solutely so thisis known as neurovascular coupling is
 exactly what you said it's how how does a neural activity the neuronalinfrastructure natural message passing
 that we think underlies our capacity to perceive and act how is that coupled tothe vascular responses that that supply
 the energy for that neural processing so there's a delicate web orof large vessels arteries and veins that
 gets progressively finer and finer in detail until it perfuses at amicroscopic level the machinery where
 little neurons lie so coming back to this sort of onion perspective we weretalking before using the onion there's a
 metaphor for a deep hierarchical structure but also I think it's just ananatomical anatomically quite a useful
 metaphor all the action all the heavy lifting in terms neural computation isdone on the surface of the brain and
 then the interior of the brain is constituted by fatty wires essentiallyaxonal processes that are enshrouded by
 myelin sheaths and these give the ER when you dissect them they look fattyand white and so it's called white
 matter as opposed to the actual neuro peel which does the computationconstituted largely by neurons and
 that's known as gray matter so the gray matter is a a a surface or a skin thatsits on top of this big ball now we are
 talking magic soup but it's a big ball of collections like spaghetti verycarefully structured with sparse
 connectivity that preserve this deep hierarchical structure but all theaction takes place on the surface on the
 cortex of the onion and that means that you have to supply the right amount ofblood flow the right amount of nutrient
 which is rapidly absorbed and used by neural cells that don't have the samecapacity that your leg muscles would
 have to basically spend their energy budget and then claim it back laterso one peculiar thing about cerebral
 metabolism brain metabolism is it really needs to be driven in the moment whichmeans you basically have to turn on the
 taps so if there's lots of neural activity in one part of the brain alittle patch of a cup few millimeters
 even less possibly you really do have to water that piece of the garden now andquickly and that by quickly I mean
 within a couple of seconds so that

0:26:21
Speaker 0 :contains a lot of infant
 the imaging could tell you a story of

0:26:28
Speaker 1 :what's happening absolutely but it is
 slightly compromised in terms of the resolution so the the deployment ofthese little micro vessels that the
 water the garden to enable the activity to to the neural activity to play outthe the spatial resolution is in order
 of a few millimeters and crucially the temporal resolution is the order of afew seconds so you can't get right down
 and dirty into the actual spatial and temporal scale of neuronal activity inand of itself to do that you'd have to
 turn to the other big imaging modality which is the recording ofelectromagnetic signals as they're
 generated in real time so here the temporal bandwidth if you like on thetemp the low limit on the temporal
 resolution is incredibly small you're talking about near nalle' secondsmilliseconds and then you can get into
 the phasic fast responses there is in of itself the neural activity and start tosee the succession or cascade of
 hierarchal recurrent message-passing evoked by a particular stimulus but theproblem is you're looking at
 electromagnetic signals that have passed through an enormous amount of magic soupor spaghetti of collectivity and through
 the scalp and the skull and it's become spatially very diffused so it's verydifficult to know where you are so
 you've got this sort of catch-22 you can either use an imaging modality it tellsyou within millimeters which part of the
 brain is activated we don't know when or you've got these electromagnetic a EEG mEG setups that tell you to within a few
 milliseconds when folks something has responded being aware so you've gotthese two complementary measures either
 in direct via the blood flow or direct via the electromagnetic signals causedby neural activity these are the two big
 imaging devices and the second level of responses yourquestion what what are they yeah from
 the outside one of the big ways of of using this technology so once you'vechosen your the kind of mirror imaging
 they want to use to answer your set questions and sometimes it would have tobe both then you've got a whole raft of
 analyses time series analysis usually that you can bring to bear in order toanswer your questions or address your
 hypothesis about those data and interesting that they they've both fallinto the same two camps we're talking
 about before you know this dialectic between specialization and integrationdifferentiation and integration so it's
 the cartography that blob ology analyses

0:29:20
Speaker 0 :my apology and probably shouldn't
 transfer much but just the herd of fun word the blur the robot ology blood

0:29:27
Speaker 1 :ology its ideologies of which means the
 study of blobs that's nothing for are

0:29:34
Speaker 0 :you being witty and humorous or is there
 an actual there's the word blob ology ever appear in a text book somewhere it

0:29:40
Speaker 1 :would appear in a popular book it would
 not appear in a worthy specialist journal yeah it's the fond word for thestudy of literally little blobs on brain
 maps showing activations so the kind of thing that you'd see in you know thenewspapers on ABC or BBC reporting the
 latest finding from a from brain imaging interestingly though the maths involvedin that stream of analysis does actually
 call upon the mathematics of blobs so seriously they actually called Eulercharacteristics and you know they have a
 lot of fancy names in mathematics we'll

0:30:27
Speaker 0 :talk about about your ideas in free
 energy principle I mean there's a echoes of blobs there when you consider sort ofentities so mathematically speaking yes


0:30:38
Speaker 1 :absolutely yeah yes anyway well the
 first circumscribe well-defined yes--you entities ofwell in from the free energy point of
 view entities of anything but from the point of view of the analysis thecartography of you know of the brain
 these are the entities that constitute the evidence for this functionalsegregation you have segregated this
 function in this blob alledge is not outside of the blobthat's basically the oh if you were a
 map maker of America and you did not know instruction the first thing wereyou doing constituting or creating a map
 will be to identify the cities for example or the route mountains and allthe rivers all of these uniquely
 spatially localizable features possibly topological features have to be placedsomewhere because that requires our
 mathematics of identify what does a set it City look like on a satellite imageor what does a river look like I want as
 a mountain look like what would it you know what data features wood is woodevidence that that particular table you
 know that particular thing that you wanted to put on the map and theynormally are characterized in terms of
 literally these blobs or these of now the way looking at and this is a certainstatistical measure of the degree of
 activation crosses a threshold and in crossing that threshold in a spatiallyrestricted part of the brain it creates
 a blob and that's basically what physical parametric mapping does it'sbasically mathematically finessed


0:32:19
Speaker 0 :phlebology okay so those you kind of
 describe these two methodologies for one is temporally noisy one is spatiallynoisy and you kind of have to play and
 figure out what what can be useful yeah it'd be great if you can sort of commentI got a chance recently to spend a day
 at a company called neural link that uses brain computer interfaces and theirdream is to well there's a bunch of sort
 of dreams but one of them is to understand the brain by sort of you knowgetting in there past the so calls that
 are factory wall getting in there be able to listen communicate bothdirections what are your
 about this the future of this kind of technology of brain computer interfacesto be able to now have a have a window
 or direct contact within the brain to be able to measure some of the signals tobe able to send signals to understand
 some of the functionality of the brain

0:33:14
Speaker 1 :ambivalent my sense is ambivalent so
 it's a mixture of good and bad and I acknowledge that freely so the good bitsif you just look at the legacy of that
 kind of reciprocal but invasive geo brain stimulation I didn't paint acomplete picture when I was talking
 about some of the ways we understand the brain prior to your imaging it wasn'tjust leave lesion deficit studies some
 of the early work in fact literally a hundred years from where we're sittingat the institution neurology what was
 done by stimulating the brain of say dogs and looking at how they respondedeither but with them the muscles or with
 the salivation and imputing what that part of the brain must be doing that ifi stimulated then yeah and i vote this
 kind of response then that tells me quite a lot about the functionalspecialization so there's a long history
 of brain stimulation which in continues to enjoy a lot of attention nowadayspositive attention oh yes absolutely
 you know deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease is now a standardtreatment and also a wonderful vehicle
 to try and understand the neuronal dynamics underlie movement disorderslike Parkinson's disease even interest
 in transmitting its magnetic stimulation stimulating with the magnetic fields andwill it work in people who depressed for
 example quite a crude level of understanding what you're doing but youknow there are there is historical
 evidence that these kinds of brute force and interventions do change things thenyou know a little bit like buying the TV
 whether the valves are working properly but it still it works soyou know there is a long history brain
 computer interfacing a BCI I think is a beautiful example of thatit's sort of carved out its own lesion
 its own aspirations and they've been enormous advances within limits advancesin terms of our ability to understand
 how the brain the embodied brain engages with the world I'm thinking of here ofsensory substitution the augmenting our
 sensory capacities by giving ourselves extra ways of sensing than sampling theworld ranging from sort of trying to
 replace lost visual signals through to giving people completely new signals sothe well I think most engaging examples
 of this is equipping people with a sense of magnetic fields so you can actuallygive them magnetic sensors that enable
 them to feel should we say tactile pressure around their tummy where theyare in relation to them to the magnetic
 field of the earth incredible and after a few weeks they take it for grantedthey integrated the embody assimilate
 this new sensory information into the way that they feet literally feel theirworld were now equipped with this sense
 of magnetic direction so that tells you something about the brain's plasticpotential to remodel to in term and its
 plastic capacity to suddenly try to explain the sensory data at hand byaugmenting or augmenting the the sensory
 sphere and the kinds of things that you can measure clearly that's purely forentertainment and understanding the knee
 or the nature and the power of our brains I would imagine the most BCI ispitched at solving clinical and human
 problems such as locked-in syndrome paraplegia or replacing lost sensorycapacitors like blindness and death
 deafness so then we come to the more on the negative part of my own the otherside of it so I you know I don't want to
 be deflation because much of my deflationary comments was probably largeout of ignorance there anything else but
 generally speaking the the bandwidth and the bit rates that you get from brink ofPewter interfaces as we currently know
 them we're talking about bits per second so that would be like me only being ableto communicate with any world or with
 you using very very very slow Morse code and it is not in the in even within anorder of magnitude near what we actually
 need for an inactive realization of what people aspire to when they think aboutsort of curing people with paraplegia or
 replacing site despite heroic efforts so one has to ask is there a lower bound onthe kinds of recurrent information
 exchange between a brain and some augmented or artificial interface andlet me come back to interestingly what I
 was talking about before which is your if you're talking about function interms of inference and I presume we'll
 get to that later on in terms of the free energy principle Minh the momentthey may be fundamental reasons to
 assume that is the case we talk about ensemble activity we're talking aboutbasically for example let's paint
 challenge facing brain-computer of interfacing in terms of controllinganother system that is highly and deeply
 structured very relevant to our lives very nonlinear the rests upon the kindof non-equilibrium steady states and
 dynamics that the brain does the weather right so good example here imagine youhad some very aggressive satellites that
 could produce signals that could be termed some little parts of the of theweather system and then what you're
 asking now is can i meaningfully get into the weather and change itmeaningfully and make the weather
 respond in a way that I want it to you're talking about chaos control on ascale which is almost unimaginable so
 there may be fundamental reasons why BCI as you might read about it in a sciencefiction novel aspirational BCI may never
 actually work in the sense that to really be integrated and be part of thesystem isn't impermanent requires you to
 have evolved with that system that you know you you have to be part of a verydelicately structured deeply structured
 dynamic ensemble activity that is not like rewiring a broken computer orplugging in a peripheral interface
 adapter it is much more like getting into the weather pans or a come back toyour magic soup is getting into the
 active matter and meaningfully relate that to the outside world so I thinkthere are an enormous challenges there


0:41:09
Speaker 0 :so I think the example the weather is a
 brilliant one and I think you paint a really interesting picture and it wasn'tas negative as they thought it's
 essentially saying there's it might be incredibly challenging including thelower bound of the bandwidth and so on I
 kind of so and just to full disclosure I come from the machine learning world somy my
 natural thought is the hardest part is the engineering challenge of controllingthe weather of getting those satellites
 up and running in and so on and once they are then the rest is offundamentally the same approaches that
 allow you to be to win in the game of Go will allow you to potentially play inthis soup in this chaos so I have I have
 a hope that so machine learning methods will will help us play in the soup asbut perhaps you're right that it is a
 via biology and the brain is just an incredible an incredible system that maybe almost impossible to get in but for
 me what seems impossible is is the incredible mess of blood vessels thatyou also described without you know we
 also value the brain you can't make any mistakes you can't damage things so tome that engineering challenge seems
 nearly impossible one of the things I was really impressed by at neuro-link isjust just talking to brilliant
 neurosurgeons and the roboticists that it made me realize that even though itseems impossible if anyone can do it
 it's some of these world-class engineers that are trying to take it on so so Ithink the conclusion of our discussion
 here is of this part is is basically that the problem is really hard buthopefully not impossible absolutely so
 if it's ok let's start with the basics so you've also formulated a fascinatingprinciple the free energy principle
 could we maybe start at the basics and what is the free energy principle well

0:43:18
Speaker 1 :in fact the free energy principle
 inherits a lot from the building of these data analytic approaches to theseyou know very high dimensional time soon
 as you get get from the brain so I think is interesting to acknowledge that andin particular the analysis tools that
 try to address the other side which is a functional integrations on theconnectivity analyses on the one hand
 but I should also acknowledge it inherits an awful lot from machinelearning as well so the free energy
 principle and is just a formal statement that the the existential imperatives forany system that manages to survive in a
 changing world is can be cast as a an inference problemin the sense that you can interpret the
 probability of existing as the evidence that you exist and if you can write downthat problem of existence as a
 statistical problem that you can use all the maths that has been developed forinference to understand and characterize
 the ensemble dynamics that must be in play in the service of that inference sotechnically what that means is you can
 always interpret anything that exists in virtue or being separate from theenvironment in which it exists as trying
 to minimize variational free-energy and if you're from the machine learningcommunity you will know that as a
 negative evidence lower bound or a negative elbow which is the same assaying you're trying to maximize or it
 will look as if all your dynamics are trying to maximize the complement ofthat which is the marginal likelihood or
 the evidence for your own existence so that's basically that you know that thefree energy principle of it but even


0:45:30
Speaker 0 :take a sort of a small step back or as
 you said the existential imperative there's a lot of beautiful poetic wordshere but to put it crudely there's a
 it's a fascinating idea of basically just of trying to describe if you'relooking at a blob how do you know this
 thing is alive what does it mean to be alive what doesit mean to be to exist and so you can
 look at the brain you can look at parts of the brain or you this is just thegeneral principle that applies to almost
 thing and ye and you system it that's just a fascinating sort ofphilosophically at every level question
 and the methodology to try to answer that question what does it mean to bealive yeah so that that that's a huge
 endeavor and it's nice that there's at least some from some perspective a cleananswer so maybe can you talk about that
 optimization view of it so what what's trying to be minimized to maximize whata system that's alive what is it trying


0:46:36
Speaker 1 :to minimize right you've you've made a
 big move yes to make big moves but you've assumed that the things the thingexists before the in a state that could
 be living on nonliving so I may ask you or what licenses you to say thatsomething exists that's why I use the
 word existential it's beyond living it's just existence so if you drill down ontothe definition of things that exist then
 they have certain properties if you borrow the maths from non-equilibriumsteady state physics that enable you to
 interpret their existence in terms of this optimization procedure so it's goodyou introduce the word optimization so
 what the free-energy principle in its sort of most ambitious but also mostdeflationary and simplest says is if
 something exists then it must by the mathematics of non-equilibrium steadystate exhibit properties that may
 look as if it is optimizing a particular quantity and it turns out thatparticular quantity happens to be
 exactly the same as the evidence lower bound in machine learning or Bayesianmodel evidence in Bayesian statistics or
 and then I can list a whole other you know list of ways of understanding thisthis this key quantity which is a bound
 on on surprisal self information if you know information theory there are wholethere are a number of different
 perspectives on this contry it's this basically the log of probability ofbeing in a particular state I'm telling
 this story as an honest and attempt to answer your question and I'm answeringit as if I was pretending to be a
 physicist who was trying to understand the fundaments of non-equilibrium steadystate and I shouldn't really be doing
 that because the last time I was taught physics I was in my twenties what kind

0:49:04
Speaker 0 :of systems when you think about the free
 energy principle what kind of systems are you imagining it's a sort of morespecific kind of case study you know I'm


0:49:12
Speaker 1 :imagining a range of systems but you're
 at its simplest a sim a single-celled organism that canbe identified from its eco nation or its
 environment so at its simplest that that's basically what what I alwaysimagined in my head and you may ask well
 is there anything how on earth can you even in elaborate questions about theexistence of a acing a single drop of
 oil for example yeah what but there aren't D questions therewhy doesn't the oil why doesn't the
 thing the interface between the drop of oil that contains an interior and thething that is not the drop of oil which
 is the solvent in which it is immersed how does that interface persist overtime why doesn't the oldest dissolve
 into solvent so what special properties of theexchange between the surface of the oil
 drop and the external states in which it's immersed if you're physicists saywould be the heat bath you know you've
 got a you've got a physical system an ensemble again with about ten stomachsensemble dynamics an ensemble of ik of
 atoms or molecules immersed in the heat path but the question is how did theheat bath get there and why is it not


0:50:41
Speaker 0 :dissolved why was it maintaining itself
 exactly what actions is it I mean it's such a fascinating idea of a drop of oiland I guess it would dissolve in water
 wouldn't dissolve in water so what

0:50:52
Speaker 1 :precisely so why not so why not why not


0:50:54
Speaker 0 :and how do you mathematically describe
 me is such a beautiful idea and also the idea of like where does the thing wheredoes the drop of oil and yeah and where
 does it begin right so I mean you're

0:51:07
Speaker 1 :asking the questions deep in in a normal
 area but what you can do you see so this is a deflationary part of itcan I just qualify mouths so by saying
 that normally when I'm asked this question I answer from the point of viewof a psychologist we talk about
 predictive processing and pretty coding and you know the brain is an inferencemachine but you haven't asked me from
 that perspective I'm answering from the point of view of a physicist so you youknow the question is not so much why but
 if it exists what properties must it display so that's the deflation in partthe 300 prints we print the 300
 principal does not supply and answer as to why it's saying if something existsthen he must display these properties
 that's that's the other sort of the thing that's on offer and it so happensthat these properties a must display are
 actually intriguing and have this inferential gloss this there's this sortof self evidencing loss that inherits
 from the fact that the very preservation of the boundary between the oil drop andthe not oil drop requires an optimized
 of a particular function or a functional that's that defines the presence of theexistence of of this order which is why
 I started with existential imperatives and the it ISM it is a necessarycondition for existence that this must
 occur because the thing the boundary basically defines the things that'sexisting so it is that self-assembly
 aspect it's that for the you hinting at in biology sometimes known as Autopoiesis in computational chemistry Mis
 self-assembly it's the what what does it look like sorry how would you describethings that configure themselves out of
 nothing the where they clearly demarcate themselves from the states on the soupin which they are immersed so from the
 point of view of computational chemistry for example you just understand that asa configuration of a macromolecule to
 minimize its free energy is thermodynamic free energy it's exactlythe same principle that we've been
 talking about that thermodynamic free energy is just the negative elbow it'sthe same mathematical calm construct so
 the very emergence of existence of structure or form that can bedistinguished from the environment or
 the thing that is not the thing necessitates the you know the existenceof an objective function then it looks
 as if it is minimizing it's finally a free energy minima and so just to

0:54:00
Speaker 0 :clarify I'm trying to wrap my head
 around so the the free energy principle says that if something exists these arethe properties it should display yes so
 what what that means is we can't just look we can't just go into a soup andthere's no mechanism if free energy
 principle doesn't give us a mechanism to find the things that exist is that whatit was implying is being applied that
 you can kind of use it to reason to think about like study a particularsystem and say
 does this exhibit these qualities that's

0:54:41
Speaker 1 :an excellent question to answer that
 after I have to return to your previous question but what's the differencebetween living and nonliving things


0:54:51
Speaker 0 :actually Society so yeah that maybe we
 can go there you kind of drew a line and and forgive me for the stupid questionsbut the you kind of draw a line between
 living and existing yeah is there an interesting sort of distinctiondistinction


0:55:07
Speaker 1 :yeah I think there is so you know things
 do exist grains of sand rocks on the moon trees you so all of these thingscan be separated from the environment in
 which they are immersed and therefore there must at some level be optimizingtheir free energy taking this sort of
 model evidence interpretation of this quantity that basically means their selfevidencing another nice little twist of
 phrase here is that you are your own existence proof you know statisticallyspeaking which I don't think I said that
 somebody did but I love that phrase you

0:55:54
Speaker 0 :are your own existence proof yeah


0:55:55
Speaker 1 :so it's ur existential isn't it I'm


0:55:59
Speaker 0 :gonna have to think about there for a
 few days yeah the view there's a beautiful line

0:56:06
Speaker 1 :so the the step through to answer your
 question about you know what's it good for big girl on the following linesfirst of all you have to define what it
 means to exist which down as you rightly pointed out you have to define whatprobabilistic properties must the states
 of something possess so that it has so it knows where it finishes and then youwrite out that down in terms of
 statistical independence is again sparsity again it's not what's connectedor what score elated or what depends
 upon what it's what's not correlated and what doesn't depend upon something againit comes down to the the deeper
 structures not in this is hierarchal but the suddenly the the structures thatemerge from removing connectivity in
 dependency in this instance basically being able to identify the surface ofthe oil drop from the water in which it
 is immersed and when you do that you start to realize well there are actuallyfour sub kinds of states in any given
 universe that contains anything the things that are internal to the surfacethe things that are external to the
 surface and the surface in and of itself which is why I use a metaphor a littlesingle-celled organism that has an
 interior and exterior and then the the surface of the cell and that'smathematically a Markov blanket just to


0:57:33
Speaker 0 :pause I'm in awe of this concept that
 there's the stuff outside the surface stuff inside the surface in the surfaceitself the Markov blanket it's just the
 most beautiful kind of notion about trying to explore what it means to existyou're automatically I apologize this is
 a beautiful idea but came out of

0:57:51
Speaker 1 :California so that's I changed my mind I


0:57:53
Speaker 0 :

0:57:54
Speaker 1 :take it all so sorry anyway so what you


0:57:56
Speaker 0 :were just talking about the surface


0:58:01
Speaker 1 :about the market yeah so this surface or
 this blanket these blanket states that are this you know the because they arenow defined in relation to these
 Independence's and your Walker what different states internal or blanket orexternal states can which ones can
 influence each other and which cannot influence each other you can now applystandard results that you would find in
 non equilibrium physics or steady state or thermodynamics or hydrodynamicsusually out of equilibrium solutions and
 apply them to this partition and what it looks like as if all the Norman normalgradient flows that you would associate
 with any non equilibrium system apply in such a way that to part of theMarkov blanket and the internal states
 seem to be hill climbing or doing a gradient descent on the same quantityand that means that you can now describe
 the very existence of this oil drop you can write down the existence of thisholdup in terms of flows dynamics
 equations of motion where the blanket States or part of them we call themactive States and the internal states
 now seem to be and must be trying to look as if they're minimizing the samefunction which is a lot of probability
 of occupying this but these states the interesting thing is that what wouldthey be called if you were trying to
 describe these things there were what we're talking about are internal statesexternal states and blanket States
 now let's carve the blanket States into to sensory states and active Statesoperationally it has to be the case that
 in order for this carving up in two different sets of states to exist theactive States the Markov blanket cannot
 be influenced by the external states and we already know that the internal Statescan't be influenced by the external
 States cousin the blanket separates them so what does that mean well it means theactive States the internal states are
 now jointly not influenced by external states they only have autonomousdynamics so now you've got a picture of
 an oil drop that has autonomy it has autonomous States it hasautonomous days in the sense that there
 must be some parts of the surface of the oil drop that are not influenced by theexternal states and all the Interior and
 together those two states endow even a little oil drop with autonomous statesthat look as if they are optimizing
 their variational free energy or their negative elbow their model evidenceand that would be an interesting
 intellectual exercise and you could say you can even go into the realms of pantspsychism that everything that exists is
 implicitly making inferences on self evidencing now we made the next move butwhat about living things I mean so let
 me ask you what's the difference between an oil drop and a little tadpole or alittle lava or plankton the picture


1:01:27
Speaker 0 :which is painted of an oil drop just
 immediately in a matter of minutes took me into the world of pants is where youyou just convinced me what made me feel
 like an oil drop is a living certainly an autonomous system but almost theliving system so as a capability sensory
 capabilities and acting capabilities and it maintains something so what is thedifference between that and something
 that we traditionally think of as a living system that it could die or youcan't I mean a yab mortality I'm not I'm
 not exactly sure I'm not sure what the right answer there is because they canmove them like movement seems like an
 essential elements to being able to act in the environment but the oil drop is

1:02:16
Speaker 1 :doing that so I don't know easy the mall
 drop will be moved but does it inner of itself move autonomously well it or the

1:02:23
Speaker 0 :surface is performing actions that
 maintain its structure yeah you're being

1:02:29
Speaker 1 :too clever I was out of service
 certified a passive little oil drop this is sitting there yeah and the bottom onthe top of a glass sure I guess what I'm
 trying to say is you're absolutely right you hear you've even nailed it itsmovement yeah so where does that
 movement come from if it comes from the inside then then you've got I thinksomething that's living what do you mean


1:02:53
Speaker 0 :from the inside what I mean is that the


1:02:55
Speaker 1 :internal States the can influence
 reactive states that where the actor states can influence but they're notinfluenced by the external states can
 cause movement so there are two types of oil drops if youlike there are oil drops where the
 internal states are so random that they average themselves away and the thingcannot on a balance on average when you
 do the averaging move so a nice example of that will be the Sun the Sun Sony hasinternal States and lots of intrinsic
 autonomous activity going on but because it's not corded because it doesn't havethe deep in the Millennial sense a
 hierarchical structure and the brain does there is no overall mode or patternor organization that expresses itself on
 the surface that allows it to actually swim it it can certainly have you're avery active surface but on mass at the
 scale of the actual surface of the Sun the average position of that surfacecannot in itself move because the
 internal dynamics are more like a hot gas they are literally like a hot gaswhereas your internal dynamics are much
 more structured and deeply structured and now you can express on your mark ofin your active States with your muscles
 and and your secretary organs your autonomic nervous system and itseffectors you can actually move and
 that's all you can do and that's something which you know if you haven'tthought of it like this before
 I think it's nice just realize there is no other way that you can change theuniverse other than simply moving
 whether that moving is articulating my with my voice box or walking around orsqueezing juices out of my secreting
 organs there's only one way you can change the universe it's moving and in

1:04:53
Speaker 0 :the fact that you do so non randomly it
 makes you alive yeah so it's not

1:04:58
Speaker 1 :non-randomness so that the that's what
 sohe's and that would be manifesting we realize in terms of essentially swimmingessentially moving changing one shape a
 morphogenesis that is dynamic and possibly adaptive sothat that's what I was trying to get out
 between the difference from the oil drop and the little tadpolethe the tampo is moving around its his
 active states are actually changing the external states and there's now a cyclean action perception cycle if you like a
 recurrent dynamic that's going on that depends upon this deeply structuredautonomous behavior the rests upon
 internal dynamics that are not only modeling they data impressed upon theirsurface or the blanket States but they
 are actively resampling those data by moving they're moving towards Kemet saychemical gradients in chemotaxis
 so they've gone beyond just being good little models of the kind of world theylive in for example an oil droplet could
 in a pan psychic sense be construed as a little being that has now perfectlyinferred it's a passive nonliving
 oil-drop living in a bowl of water no problem no but to now equipped that oildrop with the ability to go out and test
 that hypothesis about different states and beings so we can actually push itssurface over there over there and test
 for chemical gradients or then you start to move to much more lifelike form nowthis cells is on fun theoretically
 interesting but it it actually is quite important in terms of reflecting what Ihave seen since the turn of the
 millennium which is this move towards it and they inactive an embodiedunderstanding of intelligence and you
 say you're from machine learning yes so what that means this this sort of thecentral importance of movement
 I think has yet to really hit machine learningit certainly has now diffused itself
 throughout robotics and perhaps you can say certain problemsin active vision where you actually have
 to move the camera to sample this and that but machine learning of the datamining deep learning saw simply hasn't
 contended with this issue what is done instead of dealing with the movementproblem and the active sampling of data
 it is said we don't need to worry about we can see all the data because we'vegot big data so we need nor movement so
 that for me is you know an important omission in current machine learned and

1:07:52
Speaker 0 :current machine learning is much more
 like the oil drop yes

1:07:55
Speaker 1 :but an oil drop that enjoys exposure to
 nearly all the data you see to be first as opposed to the tadpoles swimming outto find the right data for example it
 likes food that's a good hypothesis test analyst go and move and ingest food forexample and see what that you know is
 that evidence that I'm the kind of thing that likes this kind of food so the the

1:08:20
Speaker 0 :next natural question and forgive this
 question but if we think of sort of even artificial intelligence systems we justpaint a beautiful picture of existence
 and life so do you do you ascribe would you do you find within this framework apossibility of defining consciousness or
 exploring the idea of consciousness like what you know self-awareness and expandit to consciousness thing yeah how can
 we how can we start to think about consciousness within this framework isit possible yeah I think it's possible


1:09:01
Speaker 1 :to think about it whether you'll get
 again I'm not sure that I'm licensed to like question you I think you'd have tospeak to a qualified philosopher to get
 a definitive answer that but certainly there's a lot of interest in using notjust these ideas but related ideas from
 information theory to try and tie down the the maths and the calculus and thegeometry of consciousness either in
 terms of sort of a minimal consciousness III even less than a minimal selfhoodand what I'm talking about is the
 ability effectively to plan so have agency so you could argue that a virusdoes have a form of agency in virtue of
 the way that it selectively finds hosts and cells to live in and moves aroundbut you wouldn't endow it with the
 capacity to think about planning and moving in a purposeful way where itcountenances the future whereas you
 might announce you might think an ants not quite as unconscious as a virus itcertainly seems to have a purpose it
 talks to its friends on route during its foraging it has a different kind ofautonomy which is biotic but beyond a


1:10:39
Speaker 0 :virus so there's something about so
 there's some line that has to do with the complexity of planning yes that maycontain an answer I mean it'd be
 beautiful if if we can find a line beyond which you could say look being ascautious yes it would be these are
 wonderful lines that we've drawn with existence life and consciousness yes it

1:11:03
Speaker 1 :will be very nice what one little
 wrinkle there and this is something I've only learned in the past few months isthe notion the philosophical notion of
 vagueness so you're saying it would be wonderful to draw a line and I hadalways assumed that that line at some
 point would be drawn and until about four months ago and thephilosopher told me about vagueness so I
 know if you've come across this but it's a technical concept and I think mostrevealingly illustrated with at what
 point does a pile of sand become a pile is it one grain two grains three grainsor four grains so at what point would
 you draw the line between being a pile of sand and a collection of some of thegrains of sand in the same way is it
 right to ask where would I draw the line between conscious and unconscious and itmight be a vague concept having said
 that I agree with you entirely I know systems that have the ability to plan sojust technically what that means is your
 your inferential self evidencing by which I simply mean the dynamicsliterally the thermodynamics and
 gradient flows that underwrite the preservation of your oil droplet likeform are described as a canvas who has
 an optimization of Molag Bayesian model evidence in your elbow that selfevidencing must be evidence for a model
 of what's causing the sensory impressions on the sensory part of yoursurface or your Markov blanket if that
 model is capable of planning it must include a model of the futureconsequences who your active States or
 your action just panning so we're now in the game of planning as inference nownotice what we've made though we've made
 quite a big move away from big data and machine learning because again it's theconsequences of moving it's a
 consequence of selecting those data or those data or looking over there andlike that tells you immediately that
 even to be a contender for a conscious artifact or you know a as it's strong AIor generalize a little no
 then you've got to have movement in the game and furthermore you've got to havea genitive model of the sort you might
 find in say a variation or two encoder that is thinking about the futureconditioned upon different courses of
 action now that brings a number of things to the table which which now isstart think more those who've got all
 the right ingredients talk about consciousness I've now got to select anamong a number of different courses of
 action into the future as part of planning I've now got free will the actof selecting this course of action or
 that policy or that policy or that action suddenly makes me into aninference machine of self evidencing
 artifact that now looks as if it's selecting amongst different alternativeways forward as I actively swim here or
 swim there all yes look over here look over there so I think you've now got toa situation if there is planning in the
 mix you're now getting much closer to that line if that line whatever to existI don't think it gets you quite as far
 as self aware though I think you and then your you have to I think grapplewith the question how would formally
 write down a calculus or a maths of self-awareness I don't think it'simpossible to do but I think you would
 know we pressure on you to actually commit to a formal definition or a meanby self awareness I think most people
 that I know would probably say that a goldfish no pet fish was not self-awarethey would probably argue about their
 favourite cat but would be quite happy to say thatthat mom was self-aware so I mean but


1:15:15
Speaker 0 :that might very well connect to some
 level of complexity with planning it seems like self-awareness is essentialfor complex planning yeah do you want to


1:15:26
Speaker 1 :talk about further coffee you're
 absolutely right again the line is

1:15:30
Speaker 0 :unclear but it seems like integrating
 yourself into the world into Europe into your planning is essential forconstructing complex plans yes yeah


1:15:42
Speaker 1 :

1:15:44
Speaker 0 :so I'm mathematically describing that in
 the same elegant way as you have the free energy principle might be difficult

1:15:51
Speaker 1 :well yes and no I don't think that well
 perhaps we should just can we just go back that's a very important answer yougave like I think if I just unpacked it
 you know you'd see the truisms or you've just you've just exposed France butmaybe so yeah I I'm mindful that I
 didn't answer your question before well yeah what's the pre hundred principlegood for is it just a pretty theoretical
 exercise to explain non-equilibrium steady stays yes it is it does nothingmore for you than that it can be
 regarded as our arrogance but you know it is of the sort of theory of naturalselection or a hypothesis of natural
 selection beautiful undeniably true but tells youabsolutely nothing else yeah y-you have
 legs and eyes and you know it tells you nothing about the actual phenotyping andit wouldn't allow you to build something
 so the free press or directly the thigh itself is is as vacuous as mosttautological theories and by
 tautological of course I'm talking to that you know the theory of Naturals thesurvival of the fittest and once the
 fittest isn't survival while this why cuz the fitter in disc around in circlesis in a sense the free energy principle
 has that same you know deflationary tautology I'm you're under the hood it'syeah it's two ago it's a characteristic
 of things that exist why they exist because they minimize their energy whilethe minified know as a free energy
 because they exist and use keep on going round and roundbut the what the practical thing which
 you don't get from natural selection but you could say has now manifest in thingslike differential evolution or genetic
 algorithms or NCM see for example in machine learning the practical thing youcan get is if it looks as if things that
 exist are trying to have density dynamics and look as though they'reoptimizing a variational free energy and
 a variational free energy has to be a functional or a gerund to model aprobabilistic description of causes and
 consequences causes out there consequences in the sensorial on thesensory parts of the Markov blanket then
 it should in theory possible to write down the genitive model work out thegradients and then cause it to
 autonomously self-evidence so you should be able to write down oil droplets youshould be able to create artifacts where
 you have supplied the objective function their supplies the gradients andsupplies the self-organizing dynamics to
 non-equilibrium steady state so there is actually a practical application thefree energy principle when you can write
 down your required evidence in terms of well when you can ride down theGeraldton model that is the thing that
 has the evidence the probability of these sensory data on this data giventhat given that model is effectively the
 thing that the elbow of the variational free energy bounds little proximate s'that means that you can actually write
 down the model and the kind of thing that you want to engineer the kind ofAGI odd artificial general intelligence
 that you want to manifest probabilistically and then you engineeror world work where you would engineer a
 robot and a computer to perform a gradient descent on that objectivefunction so it does have a practical
 implication now why am i Wittering on about that it did seem relevant to yesso what kinds of J so the answer to the
 but it would it be easier and be hard well mathematically is easy I've justtold you all you
 right down your your perfect artifact probabilistically in the form of apromising charity model probability
 distribution over the causes and consequences of the world in which thisthing is immersed and then you just
 engineer a computer and a robot to perform a gradient descent on thatobjective function no problem but of
 course the big problem is writing down the generative model so that's where theheavy lifting comes in yeah so it's it's
 the form and the structure of that journal team model which basicallydefines the artifact that you will
 create or indeed the kind of artifact that has self-awareness so that's whereall the hard work comes very much like
 natural selection doesn't tell you in the slightest why you have eyes so youhave to drill down on the actual feeding
 time the actual giant ear model so with that in mind what did you tell me thattells me immediately the kinds of
 journey models I would have to write down in order to have self-awarenesswhat you said to me was I have to have a
 model that is effectively fit for purpose for this kind of world in whichI operate and if I now make the
 observation that this kind of world is effectively largely populated by otherthings like me ie you then it makes
 enormous sense that if I can develop a hypothesis that we are similar kinds ofcreatures this is in fact the same kind
 of creature but I am me and you are you then itbecomes again mandated to have a sense
 of self so if I live in a world that is constituted by things like me basicallya social world a community then it
 becomes necessary now for me to him further it's me talking and not youtalking I wouldn't need that if is on
 Mars by myself or if I was in the jungle as a feral child if there was nothinglike it if there's nothing like me
 around there would be no need to have a an inference that our hypotheses are yesit is me that is experiencing or causing
 these sounds and it is not you it's only when there's ambiguity and play inducedby the fact that there are others in
 that world so I think then the special thing about self-aware artifacts is thatthey have learned to or they have
 acquired or at least are equipped with possibly by evolution Jarett of modelsthat allow for the fad there are lots of
 copies of things like them around and therefore they have to work out it's youand not me that that's brilliant and


1:22:22
Speaker 0 :I've never thought of that I never
 thought of that that the purpose of the the really usefulness of consciousnessor self-awareness in the context of
 planning existing in the world is so you can operate with other things like youand like you couldn't it doesn't have to
 necessarily be human it could be other kind of similar creatures and some

1:22:43
Speaker 1 :absolutely we would view a lot of our
 attributes into our pets don't waste them or we try to make our robotshumanoid and I think there's a your deep
 reason for that but it's this much easier to read the world if you can makethe simplifying assumption that
 basically you're me and it's just your turn to talk and I mean when we talkabout planning when you talk
 specifically about planning the highest.if manifestation or realizationof that planning is what we're doing now
 I mean the human condition doesn't get any higher than this talking about thephilosophy of existence and the
 conversation but in that conversation there is a a you know a beautiful art ofturn-taking
 and it neutral inference theory of mind I have to know when you want to listen Ihave to know when you want to interrupt
 an to make sure that you're on line I have to have a model in my head ofyour model in your head that's the
 highest the most sophisticated form of generative model where the genitivemodel actually has a gentle model
 somebody else's journeyer model and I think that and what we are doing nowevinces the kinds of Geritol models that
 would support self-awareness because without that we both be talking overeach other or we'd be singing together
 in a in a choir you know we're which is probably not that's not abridge analogy what I'm trying to say
 yeah we wouldn't have this discourse yeah what dance of it yeah that's right

1:24:06
Speaker 0 :Dallas to have as I interrupt I mean
 that's beautifully put I'll really listen to this conversationmany times uh there's so much poetry in
 this and mathematics let me ask the silliest or perhaps the biggest questionas the last kind of question we've
 talked about living in existence and an objective function under which theseobjects would operate what do you think
 is the objective function of our existence what's the meaning of lifewhat do you think is the for you perhaps
 the purpose the source of fulfillment the source of meaning for your existenceas one blob in this soup I'm tempted to


1:24:55
Speaker 1 :

1:24:57
Speaker 0 :

1:24:58
Speaker 1 :answer that as a physicist and free
 energy I expect consequent upon my behavior so technically that we are andwe get a really interesting conversation
 about what that comprises in terms of searching for information resolvinguncertainty about the kind of thing that
 I am but a suspect that you you you you you want a slightly more personal andfinancier and but which is can be
 consistent with that and I think it's reassuring is simple and harps back towhat you were taught as a child that you
 have certain beliefs about the kind of creature and the kind of person you areand all that self evidencing means all
 that minimizing variational free-energy in an in an inactive and embodied waymeans is fulfilling the beliefs about
 what kind of thing you are and of course we're all given those scripts thosenarratives very early as usual in the
 form of bedtime stories or fairy stories I'm a princess I gotta meet a beastwho's gonna transform ya a prince and


1:26:10
Speaker 0 :the narratives are all around you from
 your parents to thee to the friends to the society feeds these stories and thenthen your objective function is to
 fulfill exactly

1:26:21
Speaker 1 :now the narrative that has been in
 cultured by your your immediate family but as you say also the sort of theculture in which you've made you grow
 and you create for yourself I mean a game because of this active inferenceit's an inactive aspect of self
 evidencing you know not only am i modeling my environment my ecognition mymy external states out there but I'm
 actively changing them all the time and it still isn't doing the same back we'redoing it together so there's a a
 synchrony that means that I'm creating my own culture over different timescales so the question now is for me
 being very selfish what scripts were I given it basically was a mixture betweenan Einstein and shark Holmes so I smoked
 as heavily as possible try to avoid too much interpersonal contact yet enjoy thefantasy that the the you know you're a
 popular scientist who's gonna make a difference and it's like a quirky way sothat's what's where I grew up on my
 father my father was an engineer and love science and enough he loved realsort of things like Sir Arthur and his
 space-time and gravitation which was the the other the first understandableversion of general relativity and he so
 although all the fairy stories I was told as I was growing up were all aboutthese characters keeping the Hobbit out
 of this because I was quite nervous there's a journey of exploration Isuppose it's not so yeah I've just grown
 up to being what I imagine a mild-mannered Sherlock Holmes slushAlvin star would would do it in my shoes
 and you did it elegantly and beautifully
