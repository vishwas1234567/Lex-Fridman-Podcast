Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 russ tedrick a roboticist and professor at mit and vice presidentof robotics research
 at toyota research institute or tri he works on control of robots ininteresting
 complicated underactuated stochastic difficult to model situationshe's a great teacher and a great person
 one of my favorites at mit we'll get into a lot of topics in thisconversation from his time leading
 mit's delta robotics challenge team to the awesome fact that he often runsclose to a marathon a day
 to and from work barefoot for a world-class roboticist interestedin elegant efficient control
 of underactually dynamical systems like the human body this fact makes russone of the most fascinating people i

 what is the most beautiful motion of a animal or robot

0:04:34
Speaker 0 :that you've ever seen i think the most
 beautiful motion of a robot has to be the passivedynamic walkers
 i think there's just something fundamentally beautiful the ones inparticular that steve collins built with
 andy rowena at cornell a 3d walking machineso it was not confined to a boom or a
 plane that you put it on top of a small rampgive it a little push
 it's powered only by gravity no controllers no batteries whatsoeverit just falls down the ramp and at the
 time it looked more natural more gracefulmore human-like
 than any robot we'd seen to date powered only by gravityhow does it work well okay the simplest
 model is kind of like a slinky it's like an elaborate slinkyone of the simplest models we use to
 think about it is actually a rimless wheelso imagine taking a bike's bicycle wheel
 but take the rim off so it's now just got a bunch ofspokes if you give that a push
 it still wants to roll down the ramp but every time itsfoot its spoke comes around and hits the
 ground it loses a little energy every time it takes a step forward itgains a little energy
 those things can come into perfect balance and actually theythey want to it's a stable phenomenon if
 it's going too slow it'll speed up if it's going too fast it'll slow downand it comes into a stable periodic
 motion now you can take that rimless wheelwhich doesn't look very much like a
 human walking take all the extra spokes away put ahinge in the middle
 now it's two legs that's called our compass gate walkerthat can still you give it a little push
 starts falling down a ramp looks a little bit more like walking atleast it's a biped
 but what steve and andy and ted mcgear started the whole exercise but whatsteve and andy did was they took it to
 this beautiful conclusion where they builtsomething that had knees
 arms a torso the arms swung naturally uh give it a little push and that lookedlike a stroll through the park


0:06:38
Speaker 1 :how do you design something like that i
 mean is that art or science

0:06:41
Speaker 0 :it's on the boundary i think there's a
 science to getting close to the solution i think there'scertainly art in the way that they
 they made a beautiful robot but but then the finesse because becausethis was work
 they were working with a system that wasn't perfectly modeled wasn'tperfectly controlled
 there's all these little tricks that you have to tune the suction cups at theknees for instance so
 they stick but then they release at just the right time or there's all theselittle tricks of the trade
 which really are art but it was a point i mean it made the pointand we were at that time the walking
 robot the best walking robot in the world was honda's asimoabsolutely marvel of modern engineering
 it's 90s this was in 97 when they first releasedit sort of announced p2 and then it went
 through it was asimo by then in 2004 um

0:07:33
Speaker 1 :and it looks like this very cautious
 walking like you're walking on on hot coals or

0:07:41
Speaker 0 :something like that
 i think it gets a bad rap asimo is a beautiful machine it does walk with itsknees bent
 our atlas walking had its knees bent but actually ezimo was pretty fantasticbut it wasn't energy efficient neither
 was atlas when we worked on atlas none of ourrobots have
 that have been that complicated have been very energy efficientbut there was a there's a thing that
 happens when you do control when you try to control a system of thatcomplexity you try to use your motors
 to basically counteract gravity take whatever the world's doing to youand push back
 erase the dynamics of the world and impose the dynamics you want because youcan make them simple
 and analyzable mathematically simple and this was a very sort of beautifulexample that you don't have to do that
 you can just let go let physics do most of the work right and you just have togive it a little bit of energy this one
 only walked down a ramp it would never walk on the flat to walk on the flat youhave to give a little energy at some
 point but maybe instead of trying to take theforces imparted to you by the world
 and replacing them what we should be doing is letting the world push usaround
 and we go with the flow very zen very

0:09:00
Speaker 1 :zen robot
 yeah but okay so that sounds very zen but you can i can also imaginehow many like failed
 versions they had to go through like how many likei would say it's probably would you say
 it's in the thousands that they've had to have the systemfall down before they figured out how


0:09:19
Speaker 0 :they could i don't know if it's
 thousands but uh it's a lot it takes some patience there's no question

0:09:24
Speaker 1 :so in that sense control might help a
 little bit

0:09:28
Speaker 0 :oh the abs i think everybody even at the
 time said that the answer is to do with thatwith control but it was just pointing
 out that maybe the way we're doing control right nowisn't the way we should got it so what


0:09:40
Speaker 1 :what about on the animal side
 the ones that figured out how to move efficiently is there anything you findinspiring or beautiful in the movement
 of anybody i do have a favorite example

0:09:52
Speaker 0 :okay so it sort of
 goes with the passive walking idea so is thereyou know how energy efficient are
 animals okay there's a great series of experimentsby george lotter at harvard and mike
 tranifilo at mit they were studying fish swimming in awater tunnel
 okay and one of these the type of fish they were studyingwere these rainbow trout because they
 there was a phenomenon well understood that rainbowtrout when they're swimming upstream at
 mating season they kind of hang out behind the rocksand it looks like i mean that's tiring
 work swimming upstream they're hanging out behind the rocksmaybe there's something energetically
 interesting there so they tried to recreate thatthey put in this water tunnel a rock
 basically a cylinder that had the same sort of vortex streetthe eddies coming off the back of the
 rock that you would see in a stream and they put a real fish behind this andwatched how it swims
 and the amazing thing is that if you watch from abovewhat the fish swims when it's not behind
 a rock it has a particular gate you can identify the fish the same wayyou look at a human looking walking down
 the street you sort of have a sense of how human walksthe fish has a characteristic gate you
 put that fish behind the rock its gate changesand what they saw was that it was
 actually resonating and kind of surfing between the vorticesyeah
 now here was the experiment that really was the clincher because there was stillit wasn't clear how much of that was
 mechanics of the fish how much of that is controlthe brain so the clincher experiment and
 maybe one of my favorites to date although there aremany good experiments they took
 this was now a dead fish um they took a dead fishthey put a string that went that tied
 the mouse of the fish to the rock so it couldn't go back and getcaught in the grates uh and then they
 asked what would that dead fish do when it was hanging out behind the rockand so what you'd expect it sort of
 flopped around like a dead fish in the in the vortex wake untilsomething sort of amazing happens and
 this video is worth putting inright what happens uh the dead fish
 basically starts swimming upstream right it's completely dead no brain nomotors
 no control but it somehow the mechanics of the fish resonate with the vortexstreet
 and it starts swimming upstream it's one of the best examples ever

0:12:20
Speaker 1 :who do you give credit for that too
 is that just evolution constantly just figuring out by killing a lot ofgenerations of animals
 uh like the most efficient motion is that uh or maybe thephysics of our world completely like
 it's like evolution applied not only to animals but just the entirety of itsomehow
 drives to efficiency like nature likes efficiencyi don't know if that question even makes


0:12:50
Speaker 0 :any sense i understand the question
 that's reason i mean

0:12:53
Speaker 1 :do they co-evolve yeah somehow yeah like
 i don't know if an environment can evolve but um

0:12:59
Speaker 0 :i mean there are experiments that people
 do careful experiments that show that um animals can adapt to unusualsituations and recover efficiency
 so there seems like at least in one direction i thinkthere is reason to believe that the
 animal's motor system and probably its mechanics adaptin order to be more efficient but
 efficiency isn't the only goal of course sometimes it's too easy to think aboutonly efficiency but we have to do a lot
 of other things first not get eaten and thenall other things being equal try to save


0:13:33
Speaker 1 :energy by the way let's uh
 draw a distinction between control and mechanics like howhow can how would you define each yeah i


0:13:40
Speaker 0 :mean i think part of the point is that
 we shouldn't draw a line as as clearly as we tend tobut the you know on a robot we have
 motors and we have the links of the robot let'ssay
 if the motors are turned off the robot has some passive dynamicsokay gravity does the work you can put
 springs i would call that mechanics right if we have springs and damperswhich our muscles are springs and
 dampers and tendons but then you have something that's doingactive work putting energy in
 your motors on the robot the controller's job is tosend commands to the motor that add new
 energy into the system right so the mechanics and controlinterplay somewhere the divide is around
 you know did you decide to send some commands to your motor or did you justleave the motors off and let them do
 their work

0:14:30
Speaker 1 :would you say is most of nature
 on the dynamic side or the control side so like if you look at biologicalsystems if
 you know we're living in a pandemic now like do you think a virus is ado you think it's a dynamic system or um
 or is there a lot of control

0:14:53
Speaker 0 :intelligence i think it's both but i
 think we maybe have underestimated how importantthe dynamics are
 right um i mean even our bodies the mechanics of our bodies certainlywith exercise they evolved but
 so i actually i lost a finger in early 2000sand it's my fifth metacarpal
 it turns out you use that a lot in ways you don't expect when you're openingjars
 even when i'm just walking around if i bump it on somethingthere's a bone there that was used to
 taking contact my fourth metacarpal wasn't usedto taking contact it used to hurt
 it still does a little bit but actually my bone has remodeledright over the lat over a couple years
 the geometry the mechanics of that bone change to address the new circumstancesso the idea that somehow
 it's only our brain that's adapting or evolving is not right

0:15:49
Speaker 1 :maybe sticking on evolution for a bit
 because it's tended to create some interestingthings uh


0:15:57
Speaker 0 :by peter walking


0:15:59
Speaker 1 :do you uh why the heck did evolution
 give us i think we're are we the only mammals

0:16:05
Speaker 0 :that walk on two feet
 no i mean there's a bunch of animals that do ita bit there's a i think we are the most
 successful bypass

0:16:13
Speaker 1 :i think some uh i think i read somewhere
 that um the reason theyou know evolution made us walk on two
 feet is because uh there's an advantage to being able to carry food back to thetribe or something like that
 so like you can carry it's kind of this communalcooperative thing so like to carry stuff
 back to um to a place of shelter and so on toshare with others um do you understand
 at all the value of uh walking on two feet from both arobotics and a human perspective


0:16:48
Speaker 0 :yeah there are some great books written
 about evolution of walking evolution of the human body ithink it's
 easy though to make bad evolutionary arguments

0:17:01
Speaker 1 :sure most of them are probably bad but


0:17:04
Speaker 0 :what else can we do i mean i think um
 a lot of what dominated our evolution probably was notthe things that worked well sort of in
 the steady state um you know when things are when things aregood but but uh
 for instance people talk about what we should eat now becauseour ancestors were meat eaters or or


0:17:28
Speaker 1 :whatever oh yeah i love that


0:17:28
Speaker 0 :yeah but probably you know the reason
 that one pre uh pre-homo sapien speciesversus another
 survived was not because of whether they ate welluh when there was lots of food but when
 the ice age came you know probably one of them happenedto be in the wrong place
 one of them happened to forage a food that was okayeven even when the glaciers came or
 something like that i mean

0:17:58
Speaker 1 :there's a million variables that
 contributed and we can't and our actually the amount ofinformation we're working with and
 telling these stories these evolutionary stories is uh is verylittle
 so yeah just like you said it seems like if weif we study history it seems like
 history turns on like these little eventsthat uh that otherwise would seem
 meaningless but in the grant like when you inretrospect
 were turning points absolutely and that that's probably how like somebody gothit in the head with a rock
 because somebody slept with the wrong person back in thecave days and somebody get angry and
 that turned uh you know warring tribes combined withthe environment
 all those millions of things and the meat eatingwhich i get a lot of criticism because i
 i don't know um i don't know what your dietary processes are like butthese days i been eating only meat
 which is um there's a large community people who say yeah probably makeevolutionary arguments and say you do a
 great job there's probably an even larger community ofpeople including my mom
 who says it's deeply unhealthy it's wrong but i just feel good doing itbut you're right these evolutionary
 arguments can be flawed but is there anything interesting to pull out for um

0:19:17
Speaker 0 :there's a great book by the way um look
 a series of books by nicholas taleb about fooled by randomness and blackswan um
 highly recommend them but yeah they make the point nicely thatprobably it was a few
 random events that yes maybe it was someone getting hit by a rock as you say

0:19:38
Speaker 1 :uh that said do you think i don't know
 how to ask this question or how to talk about this but there's something elegantand beautiful about moving on two feet
 obviously biased because i'm human but from a robotics perspective too you workwith robots on two feet
 is it um is it all useful to build robots that are on two feet as opposedto four
 is there something useful about it the

0:20:02
Speaker 0 :most um i mean the reason i
 spent a long time working on bipedal walking was because it was hardand it was um it challenged control
 theory in ways that i thought were importantum i wouldn't have
 ever tried to convince you that you shouldstart a company around bipeds or
 something like this there are people that make prettycompelling arguments right i think the
 most compelling one is that the world is built for the humanform
 and if you want a robot to work in the world we have todaythen you know having a human form is a
 pretty good way to go there there are places that a biped cango that would be hard for
 other form factors to go even natural placesbut um you know at some point in the
 long run we'll be building our environments forour robots probably and so maybe that
 argument falls aside

0:20:55
Speaker 1 :so you famously run barefoot
 do you still run barefoot i still run barefoot that's so awesome

0:21:04
Speaker 0 :much to my wife's chagrin


0:21:06
Speaker 1 :do you want to make an evolutionary
 argument for why running barefoot is advantageousum what have you learned about um
 human and robot movement in general from running barefoothuman or robot and or well you know it


0:21:22
Speaker 0 :happened the other way
 right so i was studying walking robots andi was there's a great conference called
 the dynamic walking conference where it brings together boththe biomechanics community
 and the walking robots community and so i've been going to this for years andhearing
 talks by people who study barefoot running and other the mechanics ofrunning
 so i i did eventually read born to run most people read born to run in thefirst thing
 right the other thing i had going for me is actually that ii wouldn't i wasn't a runner before and
 i learned to run after i had learned about barefootrunning i mean started running longer
 distances so i didn't have to unlearn and i'mdefinitely
 um i'm a big fan of it for me but i'm not gonnai tend to not try to convince other
 people there's people who run beautifullywith shoes on and that's good um
 but here's why it makes sense for me um it's all about the long-term game rightso i think it's just too easy to run 10
 miles feel pretty good and then you get homeat night and you realize
 uh my knees hurt i did something wrong rightum if you take your shoes off
 then if you hit hard with your foot at allum then it hurts you don't like run 10
 miles and then and then realize you've donesomething some damage you have immediate
 feedback telling you that you've done somethingthat's that's maybe sub-optimal and you
 change your gait i mean it's even subconscious if i rightnow having run many
 miles barefoot if i put a shoe on my gate changesin a way that i think is not as good um
 so so it makes me land softer andi think my my goals for running are to
 do it for as long as i can into old age um not to win anyraces and so for me this is a you know
 a way to protect myself yeah i think um

0:23:23
Speaker 1 :first of all i've tried running barefoot
 many years ago uh probably the other way just just justuh
 reading born to run but just to understand because i felt like icouldn't
 put in the miles that i wanted to and it feels likerunning for me and i think for a lot of
 people was one of those activities that we dooften and never really
 try to learn to do correctly like it's funny there's so many activitieswe do every day like brushing our teeth
 right i think a lot of us at least me probably have never deeply studied howto properly brush my teeth
 right or wash as now with a pandemic or how to properly wash our hands or do itevery day
 but we haven't really studied like am i doing this correctly but running feltlike one of those things
 it was absurd not to study how to do correctly because it's the source of somuch pain
 and suffering like i hate running but i do iti do it because i hate it but it i feel
 good afterwards but i think it feels like you need tolearn how to do it properly so that's
 where barefoot running came in and then i quickly realized thatmy gait was completely wrong i was
 taking huge like steps and landing hard on the heel all thoseelements and so yeah from that i
 actually learned to take really small steps look ialready forgot the number but i feel
 like it was 180 a minute or something like thatand i remember i was uh i actually just
 took songs that are 180 beats per minute and then like tried to run at that beatuh
 just to teach myself it took took a long time and i feel like uhafter a while you learn to run you
 adjust it properly without going all the way to barefootbut i feel like barefoot is the legit
 way to do it i mean i think a lot of people would bereally curious about it
 can you if they're interested in trying what would youhow would you recommend a start or try
 or

0:25:30
Speaker 0 :explore slowly that's the biggest thing
 people do is they are excellent runners and they're usedto running long distances or running
 fast and they take their shoes off and theyhurt themselves instantly trying to do
 something that they were used to doing i i think i lucked out in the sense thati i couldn't
 run very far when i first started trying and i run with minimal shoes too i meani will
 you know bring along a pair of actually like aqua socks or something like this ican just
 slip on or running sandals i've tried

0:25:59
Speaker 1 :all of them
 what's the difference between a minimal shoe and nothing at allwhat's like feeling wise what does it
 feel like

0:26:06
Speaker 0 :there is i mean i noticed my gate
 changing right so um i mean your your foothas as many muscles and sensors as your
 hand does right

0:26:17
Speaker 1 :

0:26:19
Speaker 0 :sensors ooh okay and we do amazing
 things with our hands and we stick our foot in a big solidshoe right so there's
 i think you know when you're barefoot you'reyou're just giving yourself more
 proprioception and that's why you're more aware of some of the gaitflaws and stuff like this now you have
 less protection too

0:26:40
Speaker 1 :so um rocks and stuff i mean


0:26:41
Speaker 0 :yeah so so i think people are who are
 afraid of barefoot running they're worried about getting cuts orgetting stepping on rocks
 first of all even if that was a concern i think those are all likeuh very short-term you know if i get a
 scratch or something it'll heal in a weekif i blow out my knees i'm done running
 forever so i will trade the short term for the long termanytime but even then you know this
 again to my wife's chagrin um your feet get toughright and uh uh cows okay yeah i can run
 over almost anything now

0:27:13
Speaker 1 :i mean what uh maybe can you talk about
 is there tin like is there tips or tricks that you haveuh suggestions about like if i wanted to
 try it

0:27:26
Speaker 0 :you know there is a good book actually
 uh there's probably more good books since i read them but uhken bob barefoot ken bob saxton um
 he's an interesting guy but i think his book captureduh the right way to describe running
 barefoot running to somebody better than any other i've seen

0:27:47
Speaker 1 :so you run pretty good distances
 and you bike and is is there um you know if we talk about bucket listitems is there something crazy on your
 bucket list athletically that you hope to do one day

0:28:03
Speaker 0 :i mean my commute is already a little


0:28:06
Speaker 1 :crazy um what are we talking about here
 what what uh what distance are we

0:28:11
Speaker 0 :talking about well i live about 12 miles
 from mit but you can find lots of different ways to get there so i meani've run
 there for a long many years a bike there um blazeyeah but normally i would try to run in
 and then bike home

0:28:25
Speaker 1 :bike in run home but you have run there
 and back before sure

0:28:28
Speaker 0 :barefoot yeah uh yeah or with minimal
 shoes or whatever that

0:28:31
Speaker 1 :12 12 times two yeah okay


0:28:34
Speaker 0 :it became kind of a game of how can i
 get to work i've rollerbladed i've done all kinds of weird stuff but uh myfavorite one these days is i've been
 taking the charles river to work so i can put in a little row boatnot so far from my house but the charles
 river takes a long way to get to mit so i can spend a long timegetting there
 and it's you know it's not about i don't know it's just aboutuh i've had people ask me how can you
 justify taking that time uh but for me it's just a magical timeto think to compress decompress
 um you know especially i'll wake up do a lot of work in the morning and theni kind of have to just let that settle
 before i i'm ready for all my meetings and thenon the way home it's a great time to
 load it sort of let that settle

0:29:24
Speaker 1 :so you you lead a like a a large
 group of people i mean you're is there days where you're like oh [ __ ]i gotta get to work in an hour


0:29:37
Speaker 0 :

0:29:38
Speaker 1 :like i i mean uh
 is is there is there a tension there where and like if we look at the grandscheme of things just like you said long
 term that meeting probably doesn't matterlike you can always say
 i'll just i'll run and let the meeting happen how it happenslike what uh how do you
 that zen how do you uh what do you do with that tensionbetween the real world saying urgently
 you need to be there this is important everything is meltingdown
 how we're going to fix this robot there's this uhcritical meeting and then there's this
 the zen beauty of just running the simplicity of it you alongwith nature


0:30:21
Speaker 0 :what do you do with that i would say i'm
 not a fast runner particularly probably my fastest splits ever was wheni had to get to daycare on time because
 they were going to charge me you know some some dollar per minutethat i was late uh
 i've run some fast splits to daycare but that those times are passed nowi think work you can find a work-life
 balance in that way i think you just have toi think i am better at work because i
 take time to think on the way in so i plan my dayaround it
 and i i rarely feel that those are really in

0:31:00
Speaker 1 :at odds so what the bucket list item
 if we're talking 12 times 2 or approaching a marathon uhwhat uh have you run an ultra marathon
 before do you do races is there what's uh to win

0:31:19
Speaker 0 :i'm not gonna like take a dinghy across
 the atlantic or something if that's what you want but uh uhbut if someone does and wants to write a
 book i would totally read it because i'm a sucker for that kind of thingno i do have some fun things that i will
 try you know i like to when i travel i almost always bike tologan airport and fold up a little
 folding bike on and then take it with me and bike to wherever i'm going andi've it's taken me or i'll take a
 stand-up paddleboard these days on the airplane and then i'll try to paddlearound where i'm going or whatever
 and i've done some crazy things but um

0:31:50
Speaker 1 :but not for the
 you know i've i now talk i don't know if you know who david goggins is by anychance
 not well but yeah but i i talk to him now every day so he's the personwho made me uh do this stupid challenge
 so he he's insane and he does things for the purposein in the best kind of way he does
 things like for the explicit purpose ofsuffering
 like he picks the thing that like whatever he thinks he can do he doesmore uh so is that do you have
 that thing in you or you uh i think it's

0:32:27
Speaker 0 :become the
 opposite it's uh so you're like that

0:32:29
Speaker 1 :dynamical system that


0:32:34
Speaker 0 :the walker the efficient uh yeah it's uh
 leave no pain right you should end feeling better than you started okay butum it's mostly i think and kovit has
 tested this because i've lost my commute i think i'm perfectly happy walkingaround uh
 around town with my wife and uh kids if they could get them to goand it's more about just getting outside
 and getting away from the keyboard for some time just to let things compress

0:33:02
Speaker 1 :let's go into robotics a little bit what
 to use the most beautiful idea in roboticswhether we're talking about control or
 whether we're talking about optimization the math side of thingsor the engineering side of things or the


0:33:18
Speaker 0 :philosophical side of things
 i think i've been lucky to experience something thatnot so many roboticists have experienced
 which is to hang out with some really amazing control theoristsand uh
 the clarity of thought that some of the more mathematical control theory canbring
 to even very complex messy looking problemsis really it really had a big impact on
 me and and uh i had a day even likejust a couple weeks ago where i had
 spent the day on a zoom robotics conference having greatconversations with lots of people
 i felt really good about the ideas that were flowing andand the like and then i had a you know
 late afternoon meeting with uh one of my favorite control theorists andum and we went from these
 from these abstract discussions about maybes and what-ifs andand what a great idea to these super
 precise statements about systems that aren'tthat much
 more simple or or abstract than the ones i care aboutdeeply and the contrast of that is
 um i don't know it really gets me i thinkpeople underestimate um
 maybe the power of clear thinking and so for instance deep learningis amazing um
 i use it heavily in our work i think it's changed the worldunquestionable it makes it easy to get
 things to work without thinking as criticallyabout it so i think one of the
 challenges as an educator is to think about how do we make surepeople get a taste
 of the more rigorous thinking that i thinkgoes along uh with with some different


0:35:23
Speaker 1 :approaches
 yeah so that's really interesting so understanding like the fundamentals thefirst principles of the of the
 the the problem where in this case is mechanicslike how a thing moves
 how thing behaves like all the forces involvedlike really getting a deep understanding
 of that i mean from physics the first principle thingcome from physics and here it's
 literally physics yeah and this applies in deep learningthis applies to um
 not just i mean it applies so cleanly in in robotics butit also applies to just in any data set
 i find this true i mean driving as well there's a lot of folks in it that workon autonomous vehicles
 that don't study driving like deeply i i might be coming a littlebit from the psychology side
 but i remember i spent a ridiculous number of hours at lunchat this like lawn chair and i would sit
 somewhere somewhere on mit's campus there's a fewinteresting intersections and we just
 watched people cross so we were studying um pedestrianbehavior
 and i felt like as you record a lot of video to tryand just the computer vision extracts
 their movements how they move their head and so onbut like every time i felt like i didn't
 understand enough i i just i felt like i wasn'tunderstanding what how are people
 signaling to each other what are they thinking how cognizantare they of their fear of death
 like what we like what's the game what's the underlying game theory here what arewhat are the
 the the incentives and then i finally found a live streamuh of an intersection that's like high
 def that i just i would watch so i wouldn't have to sit outthere but that's interesting so like


0:37:23
Speaker 0 :that's tough that's a tough example
 because i mean the learning humans are involvednot just because human but i think um
 the learning mantra is the basically the statistics of the data will tell methings i need to know right and
 you know for the example you gave of all the nuances ofum you know eye contact or hand gestures
 or whatever that are happening for these subtle interactions betweenpedestrians and traffic
 right maybe the data will tell us they'll tell that storyi may be even i uh one level more
 meta than than what you're saying for a particular problem i think itmight be the case that data
 should tell us the story but i think there's a rigorous thinkingthat is just an essential skill for a
 mathematician or an engineer that um i just don't want to lose ityes there are there are certainly super
 rigorous um rigorous control oh sorry machinelearning people
 i just think deep learning makes it so easyto do some things that um our next
 generation are um not immediately rewardedfor going through some of the more
 rigorous approaches and i wonder where that takes usi just well i'm actually optimistic
 about it i just want to do my part to try to steer that rigorousthinking


0:38:47
Speaker 1 :so there's like two questions i want to
 ask do you have sort of a good exampleof rigorous thinking where it's easy to
 get lazy and not do the rigorous thinking and theother question i have is like do you
 have advice of um how to practice rigorousthinking and um you know in all the
 computer science disciplines that we've

0:39:14
Speaker 0 :mentioned
 yeah i mean there are times where problems that can be solved withwell-known mature methods
 could also be solved with with a deep learningapproach and
 there's an argument that you must use learning even for the parts we alreadythink we know because if the human has
 touched it then you've if you've biased the systemand you've
 suddenly put a bottleneck in there that is your own mental model butsomething like inverting a matrix you
 know i i think we know how to do that pretty well even if it's a pretty bigmatrix and we understand that pretty
 well and you could train a deep network to do itbut you shouldn't probably


0:39:57
Speaker 1 :so so in that sense rigorous thinking is
 uh understanding the the scope and thelimitations of the mess
 of the methods that we have like how to use the toolsof mathematics properly yeah i think


0:40:10
Speaker 0 :you know taking a class on analysis
 is all i'm sort of arguing is to take take a chance to stop andand force yourself to think rigorously
 about even you know the rational numbers orsomething you know it doesn't have to be
 the end-all problem but that exercise of clear thinking i think uhgoes a long way and i just want to make
 sure we we keep preaching don't lose it

0:40:35
Speaker 1 :yeah
 but do you think uh when you're doing like rigorous thinking or like maybeuh trying to write down equations or
 sort of explicitly like formally describe a systemdo you think we naturally simplify
 things too much is that a danger you run into like uhin order to be able to understand
 something about the system mathematicallywe uh make it too much of a toy example


0:41:01
Speaker 0 :but i think that's the good stuff right


0:41:03
Speaker 1 :um that's how you understand the
 fundamentals

0:41:06
Speaker 0 :i think so i think maybe even that's a
 key to intelligence or something but i mean okay what if newton and galileohad deep learning
 and and they had done a bunch of experimentsand they told the world here's your
 weights of your neural network i've we've solved the problemyeah you know where would we be today i
 don't i don't think we'd be as far as we as we are there's something to besaid about having a the simplest
 explanation for a phenomenon so i don't doubt thatwe can train neural networks to predict
 even physical you knowf equals m a type equations
 but um i maybe i want another newton to come alongbecause i think there's more to do in
 terms of coming up with the simple models formore complicated tasks yeah uh


0:41:59
Speaker 1 :let's not offend the ai systems from 50
 years from now that are listening to this that areprobably better at
 might be better coming up with f equals m a equations themselves

0:42:13
Speaker 0 :so sorry i actually think um learning is
 probably a route to achieving this but the representationmatters
 right and i think having a function that takes my inputs tooutputs
 that is arbitrarily complex may not be the endgoal i think there's still you know the
 most simple or parsimonious explanation forthe data
 simple doesn't mean low dimensional that's one thing i think that we'vea lesson that we've learned so you know
 a standard way to do model reduction or system identificationand controls is to
 the typical formulation is that you try to find the minimal statedimension realization of a system that
 hits some error bounds or something like that and that's maybe noti think we're we're learning that that
 was that the state dimension is not the right metricof complexity of complexity but for me i
 think a lot about contact the mechanics of contact the robot handis picking up an object or something
 and when i write down the equations of motion for that they're they lookincredibly complex not because
 actually not so much because of the dynamics of the hand when it's movingbut it's just the interactions and when
 they turn on and off right so having a high dimensional youknow but
 simple description of what's happening out here is fine but if when i actuallystart touching
 i write down a different dynamical system for everypolygon on my robot hand and every
 polygon on the object whether it's in contact or notwith all the combinatorics that explodes
 there then that's too complex so i need tosomehow summarize that with a
 more intuitive physics way of thinking and yeah i'm veryoptimistic that machine learning will
 get us there

0:44:05
Speaker 1 :first of all i mean i'll probably do it
 in the introduction but you're one of the great robotics people at mityou're a professor at mit
 you've teach them a lot of amazing courses yourun a large group and you have a
 important history for mit i think as being a part of the darpa roboticschallenge
 can you maybe first say what is the dark robotics challenge and thentell your story around it your journey


0:44:35
Speaker 0 :with it yeah sure um
 so the darpa robotics challenge it came on the tales of the darpagrand challenge and darpa urban
 challenge which were the challenges that brought us put aspotlight on self-driving
 cars guild pratt was at darpa andpitched a new challenge that involved
 disaster response it didn't explicitly require humanoidsalthough humanoids came into the picture
 this happened shortly after the fukushima disasterin japan and our challenge was motivated
 roughly by that because that was a case where if we hadhad robots that were ready to be sent in
 there's a chance that we could have averted disasterand certainly after the um in the
 disaster response there were times we would love we wouldhave loved to have sent robots in
 so in practice what we ended up with was agrand challenge a darpa robotics
 challenge where boston dynamics waswas to make humanoid robots people like
 me and the the amazing team at mitwere competing first in a simulation
 challenge to try to be one of the ones that winsthe right to work on
 one of the uh the boston dynamics humanoids in order to compete inthe the final challenge which was a
 physical challenge

0:46:08
Speaker 1 :and at that point it was already so it
 was decided as humanoid robots

0:46:12
Speaker 0 :there were there were two tracks there
 you could enter as a hardware team where you brought your own robotor you could enter through the virtual
 robotics challenge as a software team that would try to win the right to useone of the boston dynamics robots which


0:46:25
Speaker 1 :are called


0:46:27
Speaker 0 :atlas atlas humanoid robots yeah it was
 a 400-pound marvel but a you know pretty big scarylooking


0:46:34
Speaker 1 :robot expensive too expensive at the
 time yeah okay so uh i mean how did you feelat the prospect of this kind of
 challenge i mean it seems you know autonomous vehicles yeah iguess that sounds hard
 but uh not really from a robotics perspective it's likedidn't they do in the 80s is the kind of
 feeling i would have uh like when you first look at theproblem it's on wheels
 but like humanoid robots that sounds really hardso what like what are your the
 psychologically speaking what were you feeling excitedscared why the heck did you get yourself
 involved in this kind of

0:47:19
Speaker 0 :messy challenge we didn't really know
 for sure what we were signing up for in the sensethat you could have something that
 as it was described in the call for participationthat could have put a huge emphasis on
 the dynamics of walking and not falling down and walking overrough terrain or the same description
 because the robot had to go into this disaster area andturn valves and and pick up a drill
 cut the hole through a wall it had to do some interesting thingsthe challenge could have really
 highlighted perception and autonomous planning or it ended upthat you know locomoting over a complex
 terrain played a pretty big role in the competition

0:48:04
Speaker 1 :so and the degree of autonomy wasn't
 clear

0:48:07
Speaker 0 :the decree of autonomy was always a
 central part of the discussion so um what wasn't clear was how we wouldbe able how far we'd be able to get with
 it so the idea was always that you wantsemi-autonomy
 that you want the robot to have enough compute that you can have a degradednetwork link to a human and so the same
 way you we had degraded networks at many natural disasters you'd sendyour robot in
 you'd be able to get a few bits back and forth but you don't get to have enoughpotentially to fully
 uh operate the robot in every joint of the robotso and then the question was and the
 gamesmanship of the organizers was to figure out what we'recapable of push us as far as we could
 so that um it would differentiate the teams thatput more autonomy on the robot and had a
 few clicks and just said go there do this go there do this versus someonewho's picking
 every footstep or something like that so

0:49:05
Speaker 1 :what were some memories
 painful triumphant from the experience like what was that journey maybeif you can dig in a little deeper maybe
 even on the technical side and the team side that that whole process of umfrom the early idea stages to actually
 competing

0:49:27
Speaker 0 :i mean this was a defining experience
 for me i i it was it came at the right time for mein my career i had gotten tenure before
 i was do a sabbatical and most people dosomething you know
 relaxing and restorative for a

0:49:40
Speaker 1 :sabbatical so you got tenure before the


0:49:44
Speaker 0 :the before this yeah yeah yeah it was a
 good time for me i had i had we had a bunch of algorithmsthat we were very happy with we wanted
 to see how far we could push them and this was a chance to really test ourmetal
 to do more proper software engineering the team we all just worked our buttsoff
 we you know we're in that lab almost all the timeokay so i mean there were some of course
 high highs and low lows throughout that anytime you're you knownot sleeping and
 devoting your life to a 400 pound humanoid umi remember actually one funny moment
 where we're all super tired and so atlas had to walk across cinderblocks that was one of the obstacles
 and i remember atlas was powered down and hanging limp you know on the on itsharness
 and the the humans were there like laying you know picking up and layingthe brick down so that the robot could
 walk over it and i thought what is wrong with this you know we've got a robotjust watching us do all the manual labor
 so that it can take its little um stroll across the train buti mean even the even the virtual
 robotics challenge was was super nerve-wracking and dramatic iremember
 um so so we were using gazebo as a simulatoruh on the cloud there was all these
 interesting challenges i think um the investment that that osrsfc whatever they were called at that
 time brian gerkey's team at open source roboticsum they were pushing on the capabilities
 of gazebo in order to scale it to the complexityof these challenges so um
 you know up to the virtual competition so the virtual competitionwas you will sign on at a certain time
 and we'll have a network connection to anothermachine on the cloud that is running the
 simulator of your robot and your controller will run on thisthis controller this computer and and
 the physics will run on the other and you have to connectnow um the physics they wanted it to run
 at real-time rates because there was an element of humaninteraction um and humans
 could if you do want to tell the op it works way better if it's atframe rate oh cool but it was very hard
 to simulate these comple these complex scenes at real-timerate
 so right up to like days before the competitionthe the simulator wasn't quite
 at real time rate and that was great for me because my controller was solving abig pretty big optimization problem
 and it wasn't quite at real-time rate so i was fine i was keeping up with thesimulator we were both running at about
 0.7 and i remember getting this email and bythe way the perception
 folks on our team hated that that they knew that if my controller was too slowthe robot was going to fall down and and
 you know no matter how good their perception system was if i can't make mycontroller fast
 anyways we get this email like three days before the virtual competition wellyou know it's for all the marbles we're
 going to either get a humanoid robot or we're not and we get an email sayinggood news
 we made the robot does the simulator faster it's now one pointand uh yeah we're i was just like oh man
 what are we going to do here so yeah that came in late at night for meum a few days ahead a few days ahead
 i went over there was it happened that frank permentor who's aa very very sharp he's a he was a
 student at the time working on optimization was he was stillin lab
 uh frank we need to make this quadratic programming solver fasternot like a little faster it's actually
 you know um and we wrote a new solver for that qptogether that night


0:53:27
Speaker 1 :and you start terrifying so there's a
 really hard optimization problem that you're constantly solving youdidn't make the optimization problem
 simpler

0:53:37
Speaker 0 :you you wrote any solver so um i mean
 your observation is almost spot on well what wedid was what everybody i mean people
 know how to do this but we had not yet donethis idea of warm starting so we are
 solving a big optimization problem at every time step but if you're runningfast enough the optimization problem
 you're solving on the last time step is pretty similar to theoptimization you're going to solve with
 the next we had course had told our commercialsolver to use warm starting
 but even the interface to that commercial solverwas causing us these delays so what we
 did was we basically wrote we called itfastqp at the time
 we wrote a very lightweight very fast layerwhich would basically check if nearby
 solutions to the quadratic program were which were very easily checked uhcould stabilize the robot
 and if they couldn't we would fall back

0:54:30
Speaker 1 :to the solver you couldn't really test
 this well right

0:54:32
Speaker 0 :um or like i mean so we always knew that
 if we fell back if we it got to the pointwhere if for some reason
 things slowed down and we fell back to the original solver the robot wouldactually literally fall down
 um so it was it was a harrowing sort of edge we're ledge we were sort ofon but
 i mean actually like the the 400 pound humor could come crashing to the groundif you if you
 if your solver is not fast enough but you know that we have lots of goodexperiences


0:55:01
Speaker 1 :so can i ask you a weird question i
 i get um about idea of hard work so um actually peoplelike students of yours that i've
 interacted with and just and robotics people in generalbut they uh they have
 moments at moments have worked harder thanuh most people i know in terms of if you
 look at different disciplines of how hard people workbut they're also like the happiest like
 just like i don't know um it's the same thing withlike running people that push themselves
 to like the limit they all also seem to be like the mostlike full of life somehow
 uh and i get often criticized like you're not getting enough sleep what areyou doing to your body
 blah blah blah like this kind of stuff andi usually just kind of respond like i'm
 i'm doing what i love i'm passionate about i love it ifeel like it's
 it's invigorating i actually think i don't think the lack of sleepis what hurts you i think what hurts you
 is uh stress and lack of doing things that you're passionate aboutbut in this world yeah i mean can you
 comment about uh why the heck robotics peopleare uh
 willing to push themselves to that degree is there value in thatand why are they so happy i think


0:56:29
Speaker 0 :i think you got it right i mean i think
 the causality is not that we work hard and i think otherdisciplines work very hard too but it's
 i don't think it's that we work hard and therefore we arehappy
 i think we found something that we're truly passionate aboutit makes us very happy and then we
 get a little involved with it and spend a lot of time on it umwhat a luxury to have something that you
 want to spend all your time on

0:56:58
Speaker 1 :right we could talk about this for many
 hours but maybe if we could pick is theresomething on the technical side on the
 approach you took that's interesting that turnedout to be a terrible failure or a
 success that you carry into your work todayabout all the different ideas that were
 involved in um making whether in the in thesimulation or in the in the real world
 making this semi-autonomous system work

0:57:25
Speaker 0 :i mean it really did teach me
 something fundamental about what it's going to take to get robustness out of asystem of this complexity
 i would say the darpa challenge really was foundational in my thinking i thinkthe autonomous driving community thinks
 about this i think lots of people thinking about safety criticalsystems that might have machine learning
 in the loop are thinking about these questions forme the darpa challenge was
 the moment where i realized you know we've spentevery waking minute running this robot
 and again the in for the physicalcompetition days before the competition
 we saw the robot fall down in a way it had never fallen down before ithought
 you know how could we have found that you know we only have one robot it'srunning almost all the time
 we just didn't have enough hours in the day to test that robotsomething has to change right and then i
 think that i mean i would say that the team thatwon
 was was from kaist was the team that had two robots and was able to do not onlyincredible engineering just absolutely
 top-rate engineering but also they were able to testat a rate and um discipline that we
 didn't keep up with

0:58:39
Speaker 1 :what does testing look like what are we
 talking about here like what's what's a a loop of test like afrom start to finish what is a loop of


0:58:49
Speaker 0 :testing yeah i mean i think
 there's a whole philosophy to testing there's the unit tests and you can dothat on a hardware
 you can do that in a small piece of code you write one function you should writea test that
 that checks that function's input outputs you should also write anintegration test at the other extreme of
 of running the whole system together you know where thatthat try to turn on all the different
 functions that you've you think are correct it's much harderto write the specifications for a system
 level test especially if that system is ascomplicated as a humanoid robot
 but the philosophy is sort of the same i'm the real robotit's it's no different but on a real
 robot it's impossible to run the same experiment twiceso if you if you see a failure
 you hope you caught something in the logs that tell you what happenedbut you'd probably never be able to run
 exactly that experiment again and right nowi think our philosophy is just
 basically monte carlo estimation is just run as many experiments as we can maybetry to set up the environment
 to to make the things we are worried abouthappen as often as possible but really
 we're relying on somewhat random search in order to testmaybe that's all we'll ever be able to
 but i think uh you know because there's an argumentthat the things that will get you are
 the the things that are really nuanced inthe world and it'd be very hard to for
 instance put back in a simulation

1:00:16
Speaker 1 :yeah the i guess the edge cases
 what was the the hardest thing like so you said walking overrough terrain like the just taking
 footsteps i mean people there's it's so dramaticand painful in a certain kind of way to
 watch these videos from the drc of robots fallingyep it's just so heartbreaking i don't
 know maybe it's because for me at least we anthropomorphize therobot
 um of course there's everything funny for some reason like humans falling isfunny
 uh for i don't it's some dark reason i'm not sure whyit is so but it's also like tragic and
 painful and uh so speaking of which i mean whatwhat made the robots fall and fail
 uh in your view so i can tell you

1:01:04
Speaker 0 :exactly what happened on our we i
 contributed one of those our team contributed one of those spectacularfalls
 every one of those falls the has a complicated story i meanone time the power effectively went out
 on the robot because it had been sitting at the doorwaiting for a green light to be able to
 proceed and its batteries you know and thereforeit just fell
 backwards and smashed its head across ground and it was hilarious but itwasn't because of bad software
 right um but for ours so the hardest part of the challenge the hardest taskin my view was getting out of the
 polaris it was actually relatively easy to drive

1:01:43
Speaker 1 :the polaris we have
 can you tell the stars no the story of the car[Laughter]


1:01:48
Speaker 0 :

1:01:49
Speaker 1 :people should watch this video i mean
 the the the thing you've come up with is just brilliant but uh anyway sorrywhat's uh


1:01:55
Speaker 0 :yeah we we kind of joke we call it the
 big robot little car problem because um somehow the race organizers decidedto give us a 400 pound humanoid and they
 also provided the vehicle which was a little polaris and the robotdidn't really fit in the car so
 you couldn't drive the car with your feet under the steering columnwe actually had to straddle the the main
 column of the uh and have basically one foot in the passenger seat one foot inthe driver's seat and then drive
 with our left hand but the hard part was we had to then park the carget out of the car uh it didn't have a
 door that was okay but it's just uh getting up from crouchedfrom sitting
 when you're in this very constrained

1:02:40
Speaker 1 :environment uh first of all
 i remember after watching those videos i was much more cognizant ofhow hard is it it is for me to get in
 and out of the car and out of the car especially like it'sactually a really difficult control
 problem yeah and i i'm very cognizant of it wheni'm like
 injured for whatever reason it's really hard yeahso so how did you how did you approach


1:03:03
Speaker 0 :so so we had a
 you know you think of um nasa's operations and they have thesechecklists
 you know pre-launch checklists and they're like we weren't far off fromthat we had this big checklist and
 on the first day of the competition we were running down our checklist and oneof the things we had to do
 we had to turn off the controller the piece of software that was runningthat would drive the left foot of the
 robot in order to accelerate on the gas and then we turned on our balancingcontroller and
 the nerves jitters of the first day of the competition someone forgot to checkthat box and turn that controller off
 so um we used a lot of motion planning to figure out a a sort of configurationof the robot that we get up and
 and over we relied heavily on our balancing controllerand and basically there was when the
 robot was in one of its most precarious you know sort ofconfigurations trying to
 sneak its big leg out of the out of the sidethe other controller that thought it was
 still driving told its left foot to go like this anduh
 and that wasn't good um but but it turned disastrous for usbecause um what happened was a little
 bit of push here actually if you we have videos of us you knowrunning into the robot with a
 10-foot pole and it kind of will recover but this is a case wherethere's no space to recover so a lot of
 our secondary balancing mechanisms about like take a step to recover they wereall disabled because we were in the car
 and there's no place to step so we're relying on our just lowestlevel reflexes
 and even then i think just hitting the foot on the seaton the on the floor we probably could
 have recovered from it but the thing that was bad that happened is when wedid that and we
 jostled a little bit the tailbone of our robothat was only a little off the seat it
 hit the seat and the other foot came off the groundjust a little bit and nothing in our
 plans had ever told us what to do if yourbutt's on the seat
 and your feet are in the air feeding air and thenthe thing is once you get off the script
 things can go very wrong because even our stateestimation our system that was trying to
 collect all the data from the sensors and understandwhat's happening with the robot it
 didn't know about this situation so it was predicting things that were justwrong
 and then we did a violent shake and fell off in our uh face first on out ofthe robot


1:05:29
Speaker 1 :but like into the destination


1:05:32
Speaker 0 :that's true we fell in we got our point
 for egress

1:05:35
Speaker 1 :but so uh is there any hope for that's
 interesting is there any hope for uh atlas to be able to do somethingwhen it's just on its butt
 and feet in the air absolutely so you can

1:05:47
Speaker 0 :no so that's um that is one of the big
 challenges and i think it's still true um you know boston dynamics and andum animal and there's this incredible
 work on on legged robots happening around theworld
 most of them still are are very good at the case where you'remaking contact with the world at your
 feet and they have typically point feet relatively they'reballs on their feet for instance if that
 if those robots get in a situation where the elbow hits the wall or somethinglike this that's a pretty different
 situation now they have layers of mechanisms that will make ithink the the more mature solutions have
 have ways in which the controller won't do stupid thingsbut a human for instance is able to
 leverage incidental contact in order toaccomplish a goal in fact i might if you
 push me i might actually put my hand out and make a new brand newcontact
 the feet of the robot are doing this on quadrupeds butwe mostly in robotics are afraid of
 contact on the rest of our body which is crazy there's this whole fieldof
 motion planning collision-free motion planningand we write very complex algorithms so
 that the robot can dance around and make sure it doesn't touch

1:07:04
Speaker 1 :the world um so people are just afraid
 of contact because contact is seen as a difficult

1:07:09
Speaker 0 :it's still a difficult control problem
 and sensing problem now you're a serious

1:07:14
Speaker 1 :

1:07:16
Speaker 0 :person


1:07:18
Speaker 1 :uh i'm a little bit of an idiot and i'm
 going to ask you some dumb questions uh so i do uh i do martial arts uhso like jiu jitsu there's wrestled my
 whole life so let me let me ask the question umyou know like whenever people learn that
 i do any kind of ai or like i mention robots and things likethat they say when am i gonna have
 robots that um you know that can win in a wrestling match or in a fightagainst a human so we just mentioned
 sitting on your butt if you in the air that's a commonposition jiu jitsu when you're on the
 ground you're when you're down opponent um like whathow difficult do you think is the
 problem and when will we have a robot that candefeat a human in a wrestling match
 and we're talking about a lot like if i don't know if you're familiar withwrestling but
 essentially um not very it's basically the art of contactit's like it's because you're you're
 you're picking contact points and then using like leverage like to uhoff balance to to trick people
 like you uh make them feel like you're doing one thingand then they they change their balance
 and then you uh switch what you're doing and thenresults in a throw or whatever so like
 it's basically the art of multiple contacts so awesome that's a

1:08:48
Speaker 0 :nice description of it
 so there's also an opponent in there right so so ifvery dynamic right if you are wrestling
 a human and uh are in a game theoretic situation with ahuman that's
 still hard but just to speak to the you knowquickly reasoning about contact
 part of it for instance yeah maybe even

1:09:11
Speaker 1 :throwing the game theory out of it
 almost like uh yeah almost like a non-dynamic opponent

1:09:17
Speaker 0 :right there's reasons to be optimistic
 but i think our best understanding of those problems arestill pretty hard
 um i have been increasingly focused on manipulation partly where that's a casewhere the contact has to be much more
 rich and there are some really impressiveexamples of of deep learning
 policies controllers that that can appear to do good thingsthrough contact
 we've even got new examples of of you know deep learning models ofpredicting what's going to happen to
 objects as they go through contact but i think the challenge you justoffered there
 still eludes us right the ability to make a decision based on those modelsquickly
 you know i have to think though it's hard for humans too when you get thatcomplicated i think probably
 you had maybe a slow-motion version of where you learn the basic skillsand you've probably gotten better at it
 and and um there's there's much more subtletybut it might still be hard to actually
 you know really on the fly take a you know modelof your humanoid and figure out how to
 how to plan the optimal sequence that might be a problem we never solve well

1:10:36
Speaker 1 :the rapid
 the i mean one of the most amazing things to me aboutthe we could talk about martial arts uh
 we could also talk about dancing it doesn't really matter too humani think it's the most interesting study
 of contact it's not even the dynamic element of itit's the like when you get good at it
 it's so effortless like i can just i'm very cognizant of the entirety ofthe learning process
 being essentially like learning how to move my bodyin a way that i could throw very large
 weights around effortlessly

1:11:13
Speaker 0 :

1:11:14
Speaker 1 :like and and i can feel the learning
 like i'm a huge believer in drilling of techniquesand you can just like feel your i don't
 you're not feeling you're feeling um sorry you're learningit
 intellectually a little bit but a lot of it is the bodylearning it somehow uh like
 instinctually and whatever that learning isthat's really i'm not even sure if
 that's um equivalent to uh like adeep learning learning a controller i
 think it's something more it feels like there's a lot of

1:11:49
Speaker 0 :distributed learning going on
 yeah i think there's hierarchy and compositionyeah um probably in the systems that we
 don't capture very well yet uh you have layersof control systems you have reflexes at
 the bottom layer and you have a you know a system that's capable ofplanning a vacation to
 some distant country which is probably you probably don't have acontroller a policy for every possible
 destination you'll ever pick right um but there's something magical in the inbetween
 and how do you go from these low-level feedback loops to something thatfeels like a pretty complex set of
 outcomes you know my guess is i think i thinkthere's evidence that you can plan at
 some of these levels right so uh josh tenenbaum just showedit
 in his talk the other day he's got a game he likes to talk abouti think he calls it the pick 3 game or
 something where he puts a bunch of clutter down infront of a person
 and he says okay pick three objects and it might be atelephone or a shoe or a kleenex box or
 whatever and apparently you pick three items and then you pick he says okaypick the
 first one up with your right hand the second one up with your left handnow using those objects those now as
 tools pick up the third object right so that's down at the level ofof physics and mechanics and contact
 mechanics that that i think we do learning we do havepolicies for we do control for
 almost feedback but somehow we're able to still i mean i've never picked up atelephone with a shoe and a water bottle
 before and somehow and it takes me a little longer to dothat the first time
 but most of the time we can sort of figure that out soyeah i think the amazing thing is this
 ability to be flexible with our models plan when we need touse our well-oiled controllers when we
 don't when we're in familiar territory umhaving models i think the the other
 thing you just said was something about i think your awareness of what'shappening is even changing as you as you
 get as you improve your expertise right somaybe you have a very approximate model
 of the mechanics to begin with and as you gainexpertise you get a more refined version
 of that model you're aware of muscles or balance components that youjust weren't even aware of before so how
 do you scaffold that

1:14:20
Speaker 1 :yeah plus the fear of injury the
 ambition of goals of excelling and uh fear of mortalitylet's see what else is in there as the
 motivations uh overinflated ego in the beginninguh like and then a crash of confidence
 in the middle all of those seem to be essential forthe learning process


1:14:46
Speaker 0 :and also and if all that's good then
 you're probably optimizing energy efficiency

1:14:50
Speaker 1 :yeah right so we have to get that right
 uh so um you know there was this idea that youwould have
 uh robots play soccer better than human players by 2050 that was thegoal
 uh world basically was the goal to beat world champion team to become a worldcup
 be like a world cup right level team so are we gonna seethat first or um a
 robot if you're familiar there's an organization called ufcfor mixed martial arts are we going to
 see a world cup championship soccer team out of robots or a ufcchampion
 mixed martial artist uh that's a robot

1:15:32
Speaker 0 :i mean it's very hard to to say one
 thing is a harder one some problems harder than the otherwhat probably matters is
 um who who who started the organization that that i mean i think robocup has apretty serious following and there
 is a history now of people playing that game learning about that game buildingrobots to play that game building
 increasingly more human robots it's got momentum and so if you want touh
 to have mixed martial arts compete you better start yourstart your organization now right um
 i think almost independent of which problem is technically harder becausethey're
 both hard and they're both different

1:16:10
Speaker 1 :that's a good point i mean
 those videos are just hilarious like uh especially the humanoid robots trying toum trying to play soccer
 i mean they're kind of terrible right

1:16:22
Speaker 0 :now i mean i guess there is
 robo sumo wrestling there's like the robo one competitionsum where they do have these robots that
 go on the table and basically fight so maybe i'm wrong

1:16:33
Speaker 1 :maybe first of all do you have a year in
 mind for uh robocup just from a roboticsperspective
 it seems like a super exciting possibilitythat um like in the physical
 space this is what's interesting i think the world is captivatedi think it's really exciting it's um
 it inspires a huge number of people when a machine beats a humanat a game that humans are really damn
 good at so you're talking about chess and gobut that's in the in the world of uh
 digital i don't think machines have beat humans at a game inthe physical space yet but that would be
 just

1:17:17
Speaker 0 :you have to make the rules very
 carefully right i mean if if atlas kicked me in the shins i'm downand uh you know
 and and game over so there's you know it'sit's very subtle on yeah i think that's


1:17:30
Speaker 1 :fair i think the fighting one is a weird
 one yeah because uh you're talking about a machine that'smuch stronger than you but
 yeah in terms of soccer basketball all

1:17:39
Speaker 0 :those kinds of soccer right i mean as
 soon as there's contact or whatever and there's there are somethings that the robot will do better i
 think if you really set yourself up to try tosee
 could robots win the game of soccer as the rules were writtenthe right thing for the robot to do is
 to play very differently than a human would play it's you're not going to getyou know the perfect
 soccer player robot you're going to get something thatexploits the rules exploits its super
 actuators it's super low bandwidth um you know feedback loops or whatever andit's going to play the game differently
 than you want it to play yeah um and it i bet there's ways there's ibet there's loopholes
 right we saw that in the in the darpa challengethat that it's very hard to write a set
 of rules that someone can't find uh a way to exploit let me ask another

1:18:32
Speaker 1 :ridiculous question
 i promise i think this might be the last ridiculous question but

1:18:38
Speaker 0 :

1:18:40
Speaker 1 :i doubt it i i aspire to ask as many
 uh ridiculous questions of uh of a brilliant mitprofessor okay uh i don't know if you've
 seen the

1:18:52
Speaker 0 :black mirror it's funny i i
 never watched the episode i know when it happened thoughbecause i gave a talk to some mit
 faculty one day on a unassuming you know mondayor whatever i was telling about the
 state of robotics and i showed some video of from bostondynamics of the quadruped
 spot at the time it was the early version of spotand there was a look of horror that went
 across the room and i said what you know i've shownvideos like this a lot of times what
 happened and it turns out that this video had gone yeah this blackmirror episode had changed the way
 people watched um yeah the videos i was putting out the

1:19:33
Speaker 1 :way they see these kinds of robots so
 i talked to so many people who are just terrified because of that episodeprobably of these kinds of robots they
 i almost want to say they almost kind of like enjoy being terrifiedi don't even know what it is about human
 psychology that kind of imagine doomsday the destruction of theuniverse
 or our society and kind of like enjoy being afraid um i don't wantto simplify it but it feels like
 they talk about it so often it almost there does seem to be an addictivequality to it um i talked to a guy
 that says this a guy named joe rogan who's kind of theflag bearer for being terrified of these
 robots uh do you have a two questions one doyou have an understanding of why people
 are afraid of robots and the second question isuh in black mirror just to tell you the
 episode i don't even remember it that muchanymore but these robots i think they
 can shoot like a pellet or something they basically haveit's basically a spot with a gun
 and um how far are we away from having robots that go rogue like thatyou know basically spot
 that goes rogue for some reason and somehow finds a gun right

1:20:50
Speaker 0 :so i mean i'm i'm not a psychologist
 um i think i don't know exactly why people react the way they doi think i think we have to be careful
 about the way robots influence our society and the like i think that'ssomething that's a responsibility that
 roboticists need to embrace i don't thinkrobots are going to come after me with a
 kitchen knife or a pellet gun right away and i mean if they wereprogrammed in such a way but
 i used to joke with atlas that all i had to do was run for five minutesand it's battery would run out but uh
 actually they've got a very big battery in there by the end so it was over anhour
 um i think the fear is a bit cultural though because ii mean you notice that like i think
 in my age in the u.s we grew up watching terminatorright if i had grown up at the same time
 in japan i probably would have been watching astro boyand there's a very different reaction to
 robots in different countries right so i don'tknow if it's a human
 innate fear of metal marvels or if it's something that we've done to ourselveswith our sci-fi


1:22:09
Speaker 1 :yeah the stories we tell ourselves
 through uh through movies through just uh through popular mediabut if if i were to tell you know if
 if you were my therapist and i said i'm really terrifiedthat we're going to have these robots
 very soon that will hurt us like how do you approachmaking me feel better like
 why shouldn't people be afraid there's a i think there's a video that went viralrecently everything everything was spot
 in boston today which goes viral in generalbut usually it's like really cool stuff
 like they're doing flips and stuff or like sad stuff wouldbe it's atlas being hit with a
 broomstick or something like that but uh there's a video where i think uhone of the new production spot robots
 which are awesome it was like patrolling somewhere in likein some
 country and like people immediately were likesaying like this is like the dystopian
 future like the surveillance state for somereason like you can just have a camera
 like something about spot being able to walkon four feet
 with like really terrified people so like whatwhat do you say to those people
 i think there is a legitimate fear there becauseso much of our future is uncertain
 but at the same time technically speaking it seems like we're not thereyet


1:23:42
Speaker 0 :so what do you say i mean i think
 technology is um complicated it can be used in manyways i think there are
 purely software um attacks that somebody could use to dogreat damage
 maybe they have already um you know i thinkuh wheeled robots
 could be used in bad ways too drones right umi don't think that let's see
 i don't want to be um building technology justbecause i'm compelled to build
 technology and i don't think about it but i would consider myself atechnological optimist
 i guess um in the sense that i think we should continue to create andevolve and our
 world will change um and if we will introduce new challenges we'll screwsomething up maybe
 but i think also we'll invent ourselves out of those challenges and life will goon


1:24:49
Speaker 1 :so it's interesting because you didn't
 mention like this is technically too hard i don't think

1:24:53
Speaker 0 :robots are i think people
 attribute a robot that looks like an animal as maybe having a level ofself-awareness
 or consciousness or something that they don't have yetright so it's not i think
 our ability to anthropomorphize those robots is probablyum we're assuming that they have a level
 of intelligence that they don't yet have and that might be part of the fear so inthat sense
 it's too hard but um you know there are many scary things inthe world right so
 i think we're right to ask those questions we're right toum think about the implications of our
 work

1:25:34
Speaker 1 :right in the in this in the short term
 as we're working on it for sure is there something long-term thatscares you about our future with ai and
 robots a lot of folks from elon musk to samharris
 to a lot of folks talk about the you know existential threats aboutartificial intelligence
 oftentimes robots kind of um inspire that the mostbecause of the anthropomorphism do you
 have any fears

1:26:06
Speaker 0 :it's an important question um
 i actually i think i like rod brooks answer maybe the beston this i think and it's not the only
 answer he's given over the years but maybe one of my favorites ishe says it's not going to be he's got a
 book flesh and machines i believe it's not going to be the robots versusthe people we're all going to be robot
 people because you know we already havesmartphones some of us have
 um serious technology implanted in our bodies already whether we have ahearing aid or a pacemaker or anything
 like this um people with amputations might haveprosthetics
 that's a trend i think that is likely to continue i mean this is nowuh
 wild speculation but uh i mean when do we get to cognitiveimplants and the like


1:27:06
Speaker 1 :and yeah with neurolink brain computer
 interfaces that's interesting so there's a there'sa dance between humans and robots it's
 going to be it's going to be impossible to be scaredof
 the other out there the robot because the robot will be part of usessentially it'd be so intricately sort
 of part of our society

1:27:30
Speaker 0 :that and it might not even be implanted
 part of us but just it's so much a part of our

1:27:36
Speaker 1 :yeah our society so in that sense the
 smartphone is already the robot we should be afraid of yeahuh i mean yeah and all the usual fears
 arise of the misinformation themanipulation all those kinds of things
 that um that the problems are all the samethey're all they're human problems
 essentially it feels like

1:28:00
Speaker 0 :yeah i mean i think the the way we
 interact with each other online is changingthe value we put on you know personal
 interaction and that's a crazy big change that's going to happenand rip through our system has already
 been ripping through our society right and that has implications that aremassive i don't know if they should be
 scared of it or go with the flow but i don't see you know some battle linesbetween humans and robots being
 the first thing to worry about i mean i

1:28:29
Speaker 1 :do want to just
 as a kind of comment maybe you can comment about your just feelings aboutboston dynamics in general
 but you know i love science i love engineering i think there's so manybeautiful ideas in
 it and when i look at boston dynamics or legged robots in general i thinkthey inspire people curiosity
 and feelings in general excitement about engineering more than almostanything else in popular culture
 and i think that's such an exciting plus like responsibility and possibility forrobotics
 and boston dynamics is riding that wave pretty damn well likethey've found it they've discovered that
 hunger and curiosity in the people and they'redoing magic with it
 i don't care if the i mean i guess their company have to make money rightbut uh they're already doing incredible
 work and inspiring the world about technologyi mean do you have do you have thoughts
 about boston dynamics maybe others your own work and robotics andinspiring the world in that way i


1:29:37
Speaker 0 :completely agree i think
 boston dynamics is absolutely awesome i think i show my kids those videosyou know and the best thing that happens
 is sometimes they've already seen them you know uhright i think i i just think
 it's a pinnacle of success in robotics that umis just one of the best things that's
 happened i absolutely completely agree

1:30:02
Speaker 1 :one of the heartbreaking things to me is
 how many robotics companies failhow hard it is to make money with the
 robotics company like irobot like went through hell justto
 arrive at a roomba to figure out one productand then there's so many um home
 robotics companies like gebo andanki anki
 the cutest toy that's a great robot i thought uh went downi'm forgetting a bunch of them but a
 bunch of robotics rods company rethink robotics umlike do you um do you have any
 anything hopeful to say about the possibility of making money with robots

1:30:49
Speaker 0 :oh i think um you can't just look at the
 failures you can all i mean boston dynamics is a success there's lots ofcompanies that are still
 doing amazingly good work in robotics i mean this is the this is thecapitalist ecology or something right i
 think you have many companies you have many startups and theypush each other forward and many of them
 fail and some of them get through and that's sort ofthe natural way of things the way of
 those things i don't know that is robotics really that much worse i ifeel the pain that you feel too every
 time i read one of these i um sometimes it'sfriends and and i definitely
 wish it went better or would differently but i think it's healthy and good tohave um
 bursts of ideas burst of activities ideasif they are really aggressive they
 should fail sometimes certainly that's the research mantraright if you're
 succeeding at every problem you attempt then you're notchoosing aggressively enough is it


1:31:53
Speaker 1 :exciting to you uh the new spot
 oh it's okay it's so good what are you getting him as a pet

1:31:59
Speaker 0 :uh it yeah i mean i have to dig up
 75k right now it's so cool that there's

1:32:04
Speaker 1 :a price tag you can go
 and and then actually buy it and i have

1:32:08
Speaker 0 :a skydio r1
 uh love it so um no i would i would i would absolutely bea customer uh


1:32:18
Speaker 1 :i wonder what your kids would think


1:32:20
Speaker 0 :about i i actually um
 zach from boston dynamics would let my kid drive in one of their demos one timeand uh that was just so good
 so good and again forever be grateful

1:32:33
Speaker 1 :for that
 and there's something magical about the anthropomorphization of that armit adds another level of human
 connection i'm not sure we understand from acontrol
 aspect uh the value of anthropomorphizationum i i think that's an understudied and
 understood engineering problem there's been a psychopsychologists have been studying it i
 think it's part like manipulating our mind to believethings uh
 is a valuable engineering like this is another degree offreedom that can be controlled i like


1:33:09
Speaker 0 :that yeah i think that's right i think
 you know there's something that humans seem to do or maybe mydangerous introspection is uh
 i think we are able to make very simple models thatassume a lot about the world very
 quickly and then uh it takes us a lot more timelike you're wrestling you know you
 probably thought you knew what you're doing withwrestling and you were fairly functional
 as a complete wrestler and then you slowly got more expertiseso maybe
 it's natural that our first first level of defense against seeing anew robot is to think of it
 in our existing models of how humans and animals behaveand it's just as you spend more time
 with it then you'll develop more sophisticated models that willappreciate the differences exactly


1:34:00
Speaker 1 :can you say what does it take to control
 a robot like what is the control problem of arobot and in general what is a robot
 in your view like how do you think of this system

1:34:14
Speaker 0 :what is a robot what is a robot i think


1:34:17
Speaker 1 :robotics ridiculous questions no no it's


1:34:19
Speaker 0 :good um
 i mean there's standard definitions of combiningcomputation with some ability to do
 mechanical work i think that gets us pretty close but ithink
 robotics has this problem that once things really workwe don't call them robots anymore like
 your my dishwasher at home is pretty sophisticated beautifulmechanisms
 there's actually a pretty good computer probably a couple chips in there doingamazing things we don't think of that as
 a robot anymore which isn't fair because then whatroughly it means that robots
 robotics always has to solve the next problem anddoesn't get to celebrate its past
 successes i mean even factory room floor robots are super successfulthey're amazing but that's not the ones
 i mean people think of them as robots but they don'tif you ask what are the successes of
 robotics somehow it doesn't come to your mind immediately

1:35:16
Speaker 1 :so the definition of robot is
 a system with some level automation that fails frequently

1:35:23
Speaker 0 :something like it's it's the computation
 plus mechanical work and unsolved problems

1:35:30
Speaker 1 :solve problem yeah so so from a
 perspective of control and mechanics dynamics what

1:35:39
Speaker 0 :what is a robot so there are many
 different types of robots the control that you need for aum a jibo robot you know some some robot
 that's sitting on your countertop and and interacting with youbut not touching you
 for instance is very different than what you need for an autonomous car or anautonomous
 drone it's very different than what you need for a robot that's going towalk or pick things up with its hands
 right my passion has always been for themplaces where you're interacting more
 you're doing more dynamic interactions with the world so walkingnow manipulation and the control
 problems there are are beautiful i thinkcontact is one thing that differentiates
 them from many of the control problems we've solved classicallyright like modern control grew up
 stabilizing fighter jets that were passively unstable andthere's like amazing success stories
 from control all over the place um power grid i mean there's all kindsof it's it's it's
 everywhere uh that we don't even realize just like ai

1:36:46
Speaker 1 :is now so you mentioned contact like


1:36:50
Speaker 0 :what's contact so an airplane
 is of extremely complex system or a spacecraft landing or whateverbut at least it has the luxury of
 things change relatively continuously that's an oversimplification butif i make a small change in the command
 i send to my actuator then the path that the robot will taketends to take a
 change only by a small amount and

1:37:16
Speaker 1 :there's a feedback mechanism here


1:37:18
Speaker 0 :there's a feedback mechanism and
 thinking about this as locally like a linear system forinstance i can use
 more linear algebra tools to study systems like thatgeneralizations of linear algebra to to
 these smooth systems what is contact therobot has something very discontinuous
 that happens when it makes or breaks when it starts touching the world andeven the way it touches or the order of
 contacts can change the outcome in potentiallyunpredictable ways not unpredictable but
 complex ways i do think there's a little bit ofpeople a lot of people will say that
 contact is hard in robotics even to simulate um and i think there'sa little bit of a
 there's truth to that but but maybe a misunderstanding around thatso what is limiting is that when we
 think about our robots when we write our simulatorswe often make an assumption that that
 objects are rigid and when it comes down you know thatthey that their mass moves all
 you know it stays in a constant position relative to each other itselfum and and that leads to
 some paradoxes when you go to try to talk about rigid body mechanics andcontact
 and so for instance if i have a three-legged stoolwith just a imagine it comes to a point
 at the at the leg so it's only touching theworld at a point
 if i draw my physics my high school physicsdiagram of this system then there's a
 couple of things that i'm given by by elementary physics i know if thesystem if the table is at rest if it's
 not moving it's zero velocities that means that thenormal force
 all the forces are in balance so the the force of gravity is being counteredby the forces that the ground is pushing
 on my table legs i also know since it's not rotatingthat there that the moments have to
 balance and since it can in it's a three-dimensional table itcould fall in any direction
 it actually tells me uniquely what those three normal forces have to beif i have four legs on my table
 four-legged table and they were perfectly machined to beexactly the right same height and
 they're set down and the table's not movingthen the basic conservation laws don't
 tell me there are many solutions for the forcesthat the ground could be putting on my
 legs that would still result result in thetable not moving
 now the reason that seems fine i could just pick onebut it gets funny now because if you
 think about friction we what we think about with friction is weour standard model says
 the amount of force that your that the table will push back if i were to nowtry to push my table sideways i guess i
 have a table here is proportional to the normal forceso if i have if i'm very barely touching
 and i push i'll slide but if i'm pushing more and i push i'll slide lessit's called coulomb friction is our
 standard model now if you don't know what the normalforce is on the four legs
 and you push the table then you don't knowwhat the friction forces are going to be
 right and so you can't actually tell the laws just don't aren't explicit yetabout which way the table is going to go
 it could veer off to the left it could veer off to the right it could gostraight
 so the rigid body assumption of contact leaves us with some paradoxes which areannoying for
 for writing simulators and for writing controllerswe still do that sometimes because soft
 contact is potentially harder numerically orwhatever and the best simulators do both
 or do some combination of the two but but anyways because of these kind ofparadoxes there's all kinds of
 paradoxes in contact uh mostly due to these rigid body assumptionsit becomes very hard to like write the
 same kind of control laws that we've been able to be successfulwith for like fighter jets
 we haven't been as successful writing those controllers formanipulation and so you don't know


1:41:37
Speaker 1 :what's going to happen at the point of
 contact at the moment of contact there are

1:41:41
Speaker 0 :situations absolutely where you
 where our laws don't tell us so the standard approach that's okayi mean instead of having a differential
 equation you end up with a differential inclusionit's called it's a set valued
 equation it says that i'm in this configuration i have these forcesapplied
 on me um and there's there's a set of things that could happenright and um and those aren't


1:42:06
Speaker 1 :continuously i mean what
 uh so when you're seeing like non-smooth they're not only not smooth but this isdiscontinuous


1:42:15
Speaker 0 :the non-smooth comes in when i make or
 break a new contact first or when i transition from stick to slipso you typically have static friction
 and then you'll start sliding and that'll be a discontinuous change inin velocity for instance especially if
 you come to rest or

1:42:33
Speaker 1 :that's so fascinating okay so uh so what
 do you what do you uh do sorry i interruptedyou um
 what's the hope under so much uncertainty about what's going to happenwhat are you supposed to do i mean


1:42:46
Speaker 0 :control has an answer for this robust
 control is one approach but but roughly you can writecontrollers which try to
 still perform the right task despite all the things that could possibly happenthe world might want the table to go
 this way in this way but if i write a controllerthat pushes a little bit more and pushes
 a little bit i can certainly make the table go in thedirection i want
 it just puts a little bit more of a burden on the control systemright and this discontinuities do change
 the control system because um the way we write it downright now
 every different control con configurationincluding sticking or sliding or parts
 of my body that are in contact or not looks like a different system and ithink of them i reason about them
 separately or differently and the combinatorics of thatblow up right so i just don't have
 enough time to compute all the possible contact configurationsof my humanoid
 interestingly i i mean i'm a humanoid i have lots of degrees of freedom lotsof joints
 i only i've only been around for a handful of years it's getting up therebut
 i haven't had time in my life to visit all of the statesin my system certainly all the contact
 configurations so if step one is to consider everypossible contact configuration that i've
 i'll ever be in that's probably a that's probably not a problem i need tosolve right


1:44:16
Speaker 1 :just as a small attention what's a
 contact configuration what like just so we can uhyeah enumerate what are we talking about
 yeah how many are there

1:44:27
Speaker 0 :the simplest example maybe would be
 imagine a robot with a flat foot and we think about the phases of gatewhere the heel
 strikes and then the four the front toe strikesand then you can heal up toe off
 those are each different contact configurationsi only had two different contacts but i
 ended up with four different contact configurations now of coursei might have my my robot might actually
 have bumps on it or other things so it could be much more subtle than thatright but it's just even with one sort
 of box interacting with the ground already inin the plane has that many right and if
 i was just even a 3d foot then probably my left toe mighttouch just before my right toe and
 things get subtle now if i'm a dexterous handand i go to talk about just grabbing a
 water bottle if every if i have to enumerate every possibleorder
 that my hand came into contact with the with the bottlethen i'm dead in the water my any
 approach that we were able to get away with that in walkingbecause we mostly touch the ground
 within a small number of points for instanceand we haven't been able to get dextrous
 hands that way

1:45:45
Speaker 1 :so i mean you've mentioned that
 people think that contact is really hard and that that's the reason thatrobotic manipulation is problem is
 really hard is there any flaws in that

1:46:05
Speaker 0 :thinking so i think simulating contact
 is one aspect i know people often say that we don'tthat one of the reasons that we have a
 limit in robotics is because we do not simulate contact accuratelyin our simulators and i think that is
 the extent to which that's true is partly because oursimulators we haven't got mature enough
 simulators there are some things that are stillhard difficult that has changed
 but but we actually we know what the governing equations are they have somefoibles
 like this indeterminacy but we should be able to simulate them accuratelywe have incredible open source community
 in robotics but it actually just takes a professional engineering teama lot of work to write a very good
 simulator like that

1:46:58
Speaker 1 :uh now where does um i believe you've


1:47:01
Speaker 0 :written drake
 there's a team of people i certainly spend a lot of hours on it myself

1:47:07
Speaker 1 :well what is drake and what um what does
 it take to to to create a simulation environmentuh for for the kind of difficult control
 problems we're talking about

1:47:19
Speaker 0 :right so drake is the simulator that
 that i've been working on um there are other good simulators outthere i don't like to think of drake as
 just a simulator because because we write our controllersin drake we write our perception systems
 a little bit in drake but we write all of our our you know lowlevel control and even planning
 and uh optimization intelligence

1:47:40
Speaker 1 :optimization capabilities


1:47:42
Speaker 0 :absolutely yeah i mean drake is three
 things roughly it's an optimization library which is umsits on it it provides a layer of
 abstraction in c plus and python for commercial solversyou can write linear programs quadratic
 programs you know semi-definite programs sums ofsquares programs
 the ones we've used mixed integer programs and it will do the work tocurate those and send them to whatever
 the right solver is for instance and it provides a level of abstractionthe second thing is is a system modeling
 language a bit like labview or simulink where youcan make block diagrams out of complex
 systems or it's like ross in that sense whereyou might have lots of ross nodes that
 are each doing some part of your system but to contrast it with rosswe try to write if you write a drake
 system then you have to it asks you to describe a little bitmore about the system
 if you have any state for instance in the system there any variables that aregoing to persist you have to declare
 them parameters can be declared and the likebut the
 advantage of doing that is that you can if you likerun things all on one process but you
 can also do control design against it you can doi mean simple things like
 rewinding and playing back your your your simulations for instance you knowthese things you get some rewards for
 spending a little bit more upfront cost in describing each systemand and i i was inspired to do that
 because i think the complexity of atlas for instanceum is just so great and i think although
 i mean ross has been incredible absolutely hugefan of what it's done for the
 robotics community but it um the ability to rapidly put differentpieces together and have a functioning
 thing is very good but i do think that it's hard to think clearly about a bagof disparate
 parts mr potato head kind of software stackand if you can
 you know ask a little bit more out of each of those parts then you canunderstand
 the way they work better you can try to verify themand the like um you can do learning
 against them and then one of those systems the lastthing i i said the first two things that
 drake is but the last thing is that there is a set ofmulti-body equations rigid body
 equations that is trying to provide a system thatsimulates physics
 and that um we also have renderers and other things but i think thephysics component of drake is is special
 in the sense that um we have done excessive amount ofengineering
 to to make sure that we've written the equations correctly every possibletumbling satellite or spinning top or
 anything that we could possibly write as a test is testedum we are making some you know i think
 fundamental improvements on the way you simulate contact

1:50:43
Speaker 1 :yes what does it take to uh simulate
 contact i mean it just seems uhi mean there's something just beautiful
 the way you were like explaining contact and you're like tapping yourfingers on the on the table while you're
 while you're doing it just um easily righteasily just like just not even like
 it was like helping you think i guess um what i um see you have this like awesomedemo of um
 loading or unloading a dishwasher just picking up a plate

1:51:19
Speaker 0 :

1:51:20
Speaker 1 :uh grasping it like for the first time
 um that's just seems like so difficult what how do you simulate any of that

1:51:32
Speaker 0 :so it was really interesting that what
 happened was that um we started getting more professionalabout our software development during
 the darpa robotics challenge i learned the value of softwareengineering and how these
 how to bridle complexity i guess that's that's what i i want to somehowfight against and bring some of the
 clear thinking of controls into these complex systems we're building forrobots
 um shortly after the darpa robotics challengetoyota opened a research institute tri
 toyota research institute um they put one of their there's there'sthree locations one of them is just down
 the street from mit and uh and i helped ramp that upuh right out as a part of my uh
 the end of my sabbatical i guess um so so tri is uhhas given me the tri robotics effort has
 made this investment in simulation in drake and michael sherman leads ateam there of just
 absolutely top notch dynamics experts thatare trying to write those simulators
 that can pick up the dishes and there's also a team working onmanipulation there that is
 taking problems like loading the dishwasherand we're using that to study these
 really hard corner cases kind of problems in manipulationso for me this you know simulating
 the dishes we could actually write a controller if we just cared aboutpicking up dishes in the sink once we
 could write a controller without any simulation whatsoeverand we could call it done but we want to
 understand like what is the path you take to actuallyget to
 a robot that could perform that for any dishuh in anybody's kitchen with with enough
 confidence that it could be a commercial product right and andit has deep learning perception in the
 loop it has complex dynamics in the loop it has controller it has a plannerand how do you take all of that
 complexity and put it through this engineeringdiscipline and verification
 and validation process to actually get enough confidence to deploy i mean thedarpa challenge
 made me realize that that's not something you throw over the fence andhope that somebody will harden it
 for you that there are really fundamental challengesin uh in closing that last gap they're


1:53:59
Speaker 1 :doing the validation
 and the testing i think it might even

1:54:03
Speaker 0 :change the way we have to think about
 the way we write systems what happens if you if you have therobot
 running lots of tests it and it screws up it breaks a dish right how doyou capture that i said you can't run
 the same simulation or the same experiment twicein in a real on a real robot do we have
 to be able to bring that one off exp failure back into simulationin order to change our controllers
 study it make sure it won't happen again do weis it enough to just try to add that to
 our distribution and understand that on average we'regoing to cover that situation again
 there's like really subtle questions at the corner cases thati think we don't yet have satisfying
 answers for like how do you find the

1:54:53
Speaker 1 :corner cases
 that's one kind of is there do you think this possible to create asystematized way of discovering
 corner cases efficiently yeah in whatever the problem is yes i mean i

1:55:07
Speaker 0 :think we have to get better at that
 i mean control theory has um for for decades talked about activeexperiment design
 so people call it curiosity these days it's roughly this idea of trying toexploration or exploitation but but in
 the active experiment design is even is is more specific you could try tounderstand the uncertainty in your
 system design the experiment that will provide the maximum information toreduce that uncertainty
 if there's a parameter you want to learn about what is the optimaltrajectory i could execute to learn
 about that parameter for instance scaling that up tosomething that has a deep network in the
 loop and the planning in the loop is toughwe've done some work on you know with
 matt o'kelly and amancina we have we've worked on um some falsificationalgorithms that are trying to do rare
 event simulation that try to just hammer on your simulatorand if your simulator is good enough you
 can um you can spend a lot of time or you canwrite good algorithms
 that try to spend most of their time in the corner casesso you basically imagine you're you're
 building an autonomous car and you want to put it ini don't know downtown new delhi all the
 time right an accelerated testing if you can write sampling strategieswhich figure out where your controller
 is performing badly in simulation and start generating lots of examplesaround that
 you know it's just the space of possible places where that can bewhere things can go wrong is very big so
 it's hard to write those algorithms yeah

1:56:49
Speaker 1 :rare event simulation is just like a
 really compelling notion uh if it's possible we joked and we

1:56:55
Speaker 0 :called we call it the black swan
 generator it's a black swan right because youdon't just want the rare events you want
 the ones that are

1:57:03
Speaker 1 :highly impactful i mean that's the most
 those are the most sort of profound questions we ask of our worldlike uh what's the
 uh what's the worst that can happen uh but what we're really askingisn't some kind of like computer science
 worst case analysis we're asking like what are the millionsof ways
 this can go wrong and that's like our curiositywe humans i think are pretty bad at uh
 we just like run into it and i think there's a distributed sense becausethere's now like 7.5 billion of us
 and so there's a lot of them and then a lot of them write blog posts about thestupid thing they've done so we learn
 in a distributed way um there's there's

1:57:50
Speaker 0 :something that's going to be important
 for robots too yeah i mean that's that's another massive theme at toyotaresearch
 for robotics is this fleet learning concept isum you know the idea that i as a
 humanoid don't have enough time to visit all ofmy states right there's just a
 it's very hard for one robot to experience all the thingsbut that's not actually the problem we
 have to solve right um we're gonna have fleets of robots thatcan have very similar appendages
 and at some point maybe collectively they haveenough data that their computational
 processes should be set up differently than ours right

1:58:32
Speaker 1 :it's a have this vision of just i mean
 all these uh dishwasher unloading robotsi mean um that robot dropping a plate
 and a human looking at the robot probably pissed offyeah but uh that's a special moment to
 record i think one one thing in terms of fleetlearning
 and i've seen that because i i've talked to a lot of folks umjust like like tesla users or tesla
 drivers they're not another another companythat's using this kind of fleet learning
 idea and one hopeful thing i have abouthumans
 is they really enjoy when a system improves learns so they enjoy fleetlearning and they're
 the reason it's hopeful for me is they're willing to put up withsomething that's kind of dumb right now
 and they're like if it's improving they almost like enjoybeing part of the like teaching it
 almost like we if you have kids like you're teaching them something rightum i think that's a beautiful thing
 because that that gives me hope that we can putdumb robots out there uh as long i mean
 the problem with on the tesla side with cars cars cankill you
 that's that makes the problem so much harder dishwasherunloading is a little safe that's why
 home robotics is uh it's really exciting and just to clarifyi mean for people who might not know
 a tri toyota research institute so they'reuh i mean they're they're pretty well
 known for like autonomous vehicle researchbut they're also interested in in


2:00:09
Speaker 0 :home robotics yep there's a big there's
 a big group working on multiple groups working on home roboticsit's a major part of the
 portfolio also there's also a couple other projects anadvanced materials discovery i'm using
 ai and machine learning to discover new materials forum for car batteries and then the like
 for instance yeah and that's been actually an incrediblysuccessful team uh there's new projects
 starting up too so

2:00:33
Speaker 1 :do you see a future of uh where
 like robots are in our home and and like robots that have likeum actuators that look like arms
 in our home or like you know more like humanoid type robotsor is this are we gonna is we're gonna
 do the same thing that you just mentioned thatyou know the dishwasher is no longer a
 robot we're going to just not even see them as robots but do imean what's your
 vision of the home of the future 10 20 years from now

2:01:05
Speaker 0 :50 years if you get crazy yeah i think
 we already have roombas cruising around we haveuh uh you know alexa's or google homes
 on their our kitchen counter it's only a matter oftime till they spring arms and start
 doing something useful like that um soi do think it's coming i think it's lots
 of people have lots of motivations for doing it it's been super interestingactually learning about
 toyota's vision for it which is about helping people age in placebecause i think that's not necessarily
 the first entry the most lucrative entry point but it's the problem maybethat
 we really need to solve no matter what andso i think i think there's a real
 opportunity it's a delicate problem how do you work with people helppeople
 keep them active engaged you know but improve their quality of life and uhand and help them age in place for
 instance

2:02:08
Speaker 1 :it's interesting because older folks are
 also i mean there's a contrast there because umthey're not always the the folks who are
 the most comfortable technology for exampleso there's a there's a there's a
 division that's interesting there that you can do so much good with a robotfor for older folks but there's a
 there's a gap to feel of understanding i meanit's actually kind of beautiful um robot
 is learning about the human and the human is kind of learning about thisnew robot thing and it's uh also with um
 at least with uh like when i talk to my parents about robots there's a littlebit of a
 blank slate there too like you can i mean they don't know anythingabout robotics
 so it's completely like wide open they don't have that they haven't myparents haven't seen black mirror
 so like they they there's it's a blank slate here's a cool thing like what canyou do for me
 yeah so it's an exciting space i think

2:03:14
Speaker 0 :it's a really important space
 i do feel like you know a few years ago uh drones were successful enough inacademia they kind of
 broke out and started in industry and autonomous carshave been happening it does feel like
 manipulation in logistics of course first but in thehome
 shortly after seems like one of the next big things that's going to really

2:03:40
Speaker 1 :pop so uh i don't think we talked about
 it but uh what's soft robotics so we talkedabout
 like rigid bodies like if we can just linger on this whole touch

2:03:52
Speaker 0 :thing um yeah so what's soft robotics
 so i told you that i really dislike the fact that robots areafraid of touching the world
 all over their body so there's a couple reasons for thatif you look carefully at all the places
 that robots actually do touch the world they're almost always soft they havesome sort of pad on their fingers or a
 rubber sole on their foot but if you look upand down the arm
 we're just pure aluminum or something so uh so that makes it hard actually infact
 hitting the table with your you know your rigid arm or nearly rigid armis a is a has some of the problems that
 we talked about in terms of simulation i think it itfundamentally changes the mechanics of
 contact when you're soft right you you turn point contacts intopatch contacts which can have torsional
 friction you can have um distributed load if iwant to pick up an egg
 right if i pick it up with two points thenin order to put enough force to sustain
 the weight of the egg i might have to put a lot of force to break the egg if ienvelop it with a
 with contact all all around then i can distribute myforce across the shell of the egg and
 have a better chance of not breaking it so soft robotics is for me a lot aboutchanging the mechanics


2:05:14
Speaker 1 :of contact does it make the problem a


2:05:17
Speaker 0 :lot harder
 um quite the opposite uh it it changes thecomputational problem
 i think because of the i think our world and our mathematics has biased ustowards ridgid
 but it really should make things better in some ways right umit's it's a i think the the
 the future is unwritten there um but the

2:05:44
Speaker 1 :other thing is
 ultimately sorry to interrupt they think ultimately it will make things simplerif we embrace the softness of the world


2:05:50
Speaker 0 :it makes
 um it makes things smoother right so the the result ofsmall actions is less discontinuous but
 it also means potentially less you knowinstantaneously bad
 for instance i won't necessarily contact something and send it flying offthe other aspect of it that just happens
 to dovetail really well is that if soft robotics tends to be a placewhere we can embed a lot of sensors to
 so if you change your your hardware and make it more soft then you canpotentially have a tactile sensor which
 is measuring the deformationso there's a team at tri that's working
 on soft hands and and you get so much moreinformation
 if you you can put a camera behind the skin roughlyand and get fantastic tactile
 information which is um it's super important like inmanipulation one of the things that
 really is frustrating is if you work super hardon your head mounted
 on your perception system for your head mounted cameras and then you'veidentified an object you reach down to
 touch it and the first the last thing that happens right beforethe most important time you stick your
 hand and you're occluding your head mounted sensors right so inall the part that really matters
 all of your off board sensors are you know are occludedand really if you don't have tactile
 information then you're you're blind in an important way soit happens that soft robotics and
 tactile sensing tend to go hand in hand i think we've

2:07:24
Speaker 1 :kind of talked about it but
 uh you taught a course on under actuator roboticsi believe that was the name of it
 actually that's right can you talk about it in that contextwhat is


2:07:39
Speaker 0 :under actuated robotics right so
 under-actuated robotics is my graduate course it's it's onlinemostly now so i mean in the sense that


2:07:47
Speaker 1 :the lecturer's versions of it i think
 right the youtube really great i recommend it highly look on youtube for

2:07:51
Speaker 0 :the
 2020 versions until march and then you have to go back to 2019 thanks tocovet um no i've poured my heart into
 that class and lecture one is basicallyexplaining what the word underactuated
 means so people are very kind to show up and thenmaybe have to learn what the title of
 the course means over the course of the first lecture

2:08:15
Speaker 1 :that that first lecture is really good
 you should watch it

2:08:18
Speaker 0 :it's it's a strange name but um
 i thought it captured the essence of whatcontrol was good at doing and what
 control was bad at doing so what do i mean by under actuated soa mechanical system
 has many degrees of freedom for instance i think of a joint as a degree offreedom
 and it has some number of actuators motorsso if you have a robot that's bolted to
 the table that has five degrees of freedomand five motors then you have a fully
 actuated robot if you have if you take away one ofthose motors
 then you have an under actuated robot now whyon earth i i have a good friend who who
 likes to tease me he said russ if you had more research funding would you workon fully actuated robots
 yeah and uh the answer is no the world gives us under-actuated robotswhether we like it or not i'm a human
 i'm an under actuated robot even though i have more musclesthan my big degrees of freedom because i
 have in some places multiple muscles attached to the samejoint
 but still there's a really important degree of freedom that i have which isthe location of my
 center of mass in space for instance all right i'm i can jump into the airand there's no motor that connects my
 center of mass to the ground in that case so i have to think aboutthese the implications
 of not having control over everything the passive dynamic walkers are theextreme view of that where you've taken
 away all the motors and you have to let physics do the workbut it shows up in all the walking
 robots where you have to use some of the actuatorsto push and pull even the degrees of
 freedom that you don't have an actuator on

2:10:09
Speaker 1 :that's referring to walking if you're
 like falling forward like is there a way to walk that's fullyactuated


2:10:16
Speaker 0 :so it's a subtle point when you're when
 you're in contact and you have your feeton the ground there are still limits to
 what you can do right unless i have suction cups on my feet icannot accelerate my center of mass
 towards the ground faster than gravity because i can't geta force pushing me down
 right but i can still do most of the things that i want to so you can getaway
 with basically thinking of the system as fully actuated unless you suddenly needit to accelerate down super fast
 but as soon as i take a step i i get into morenuanced territory and to get to really
 dynamic robots or airplanes or other things i think you have to embracethe
 under actuated dynamics manipulation peoplethink is manipulation under under
 actuated my even if my arm is fully actuated i have a motor if mygoal is to control
 the position and orientation of this cup then i don't have an actuator for thatdirectly so i have to use my actuators
 over here to control this thing now it gets even worse like what if ihave to button my shirt
 okay what are the degrees of freedom of my shirt right i suddenlythat's a hard question to think about it
 kind of makes me queasy as a thinking about my state-space controlideas
 but actually those are the problems that make me so excited about manipulationright now is that it
 it breaks some of the it breaks a lot of the foundational control stuff that i'vebeen thinking about


2:11:51
Speaker 1 :is there um what are some interesting
 insights you could say about trying to solve anunder actuated
 like control in in an underactuated system

2:12:02
Speaker 0 :so i think the philosophy there is let
 physics do more of the work the technical approachhas been optimization so you typically
 formulate your decision making for controlas an optimization problem and you use
 the language of optimal control and sometimes numero often numericaloptimal control
 in order to make those decisions and balanceyou know these complicated equations of
 and in order to control you don't have to use optimal control todo under-actuated
 systems but that has been the technical approach that has borne the most fruitin our
 at least in our line of work and there's

2:12:40
Speaker 1 :some
 so in under actuator systems when you say let physics do some of the workso there's a kind of feedback feedback
 loop that observes the state that the physicsbrought you to
 so like you've there's a there's a perception there this is there's afeedback
 somehow do you do um do you ever loop in like complicated perceptionsystems into this whole picture


2:13:06
Speaker 0 :right right around the time of the darpa
 challenge we had a complicated perception system in the darpa challengewe also started to embrace perception
 for our flying vehicles at the time we had a areally good project
 on trying to make airplanes fly at high speeds through forestsum sirtex caramel was on that
 project and it was a really fun team to to workon he's carried it farther much farther
 forward since then

2:13:33
Speaker 1 :so that's using cameras for perception


2:13:36
Speaker 0 :so that was using cameras uh that was a
 at the time we felt like lidar was too too heavy and two powerheavy to to be carried on on a light uav
 and we were using cameras and that was a big part of it was justhow do you do even stereo
 matching at a fast enough rate with a small cameraa small onboard compute since then
 we have now the so the deep learning revolution unquestionably changedwhat we can do with perception for
 robotics and control so in manipulation we can addresswe can use perception in a i think a
 much deeper way and um we get into not only i think thethe first use of it naturally would be
 to ask your deep learning system to look atthe cameras and
 produce the state which is like the pose of my thing for instancebut i think we've quickly found out that
 that's not always the right thing to do um why is that becausewhat's the state of my shirt imagine


2:14:39
Speaker 1 :i've always
 very noisy i mean or it's um

2:14:41
Speaker 0 :if the first step of me trying to button
 my shirt is estimate the full state of my shirtincluding
 like what's happening in the backyard or whatever whatever that's just not theright
 specification there are aspects of the state that are very importantto the task there are many that are
 unobservable and not not important to the taskso you really need it begs new questions
 about state representation another examplethat we've been playing with in lab has
 been just the idea of chopping onions okayor carrots turns out to be better so
 the onions stink up the lab uh and they'rehard to see in a camera but uh


2:15:27
Speaker 1 :so details matter yeah details matter


2:15:29
Speaker 0 :you know so um
 moving around a particular object right then i think about oh it's got aposition or an orientation in space
 that's the description i want now when i'm chopping an onion okay thefirst chop comes down
 i have now a hundred pieces of onion does my control system really need tounderstand the position and orientation
 and even the shape of the hundred pieces of onion in order to make a decisionprobably not you know and like if i keep
 going i'm just getting more and more is my state space getting bigger as i cutit's it um it it's not right
 yes so there's a i think there's a richer uh idea of stateit's not the state that is given to us
 by lagrangian mechanics there is a there is a proper lagrangianstate of the system but the relevant
 state for this is some latent state is what we call itin machine learning
 but you know there's some some different state representatives

2:16:32
Speaker 1 :some compressed representation some and
 that's what i

2:16:35
Speaker 0 :i worry about saying compressed because
 it doesn't i don't mind that it's low dimensional or notbut it has to be something that's easier
 to think about

2:16:46
Speaker 1 :

2:16:47
Speaker 0 :by us humans or my algorithms or


2:16:50
Speaker 1 :the algorithms being like control


2:16:53
Speaker 0 :optimal so for instance if the contact
 mechanics of all of those onion pieces and all thepermutations of possible touches between
 those onion pieces you know you can give me a highdimensional state representation i'm
 okay if it's linear but if i have to think about allthe possible shattering combinatorics of
 that then my robot is going to sit therethinking and uh
 the soup's gonna get cold or something

2:17:17
Speaker 1 :so um since you taught the course
 i've it kind of entered my mind um the idea of under actuated asreally compelling to see the to see the
 world in this kind of way um do you ever you know if we talk aboutonions or you talk about
 the world with people in it in general do you see the worldas a basically an underactuated system
 do you like often look at the world in this way or is thisuh overreach


2:17:44
Speaker 0 :um under actuated as a way of life man


2:17:49
Speaker 1 :exactly um i guess that's what i'm


2:17:51
Speaker 0 :asking
 i do think it's everywhere i think some in some placesum we already have natural tools to deal
 with it you know it rears its head i mean inlinear systems it's not a problem we
 just we just like an under actuated linear system isreally not sufficiently distinct from a
 fully actuated linear system it's it's a it's a subtlepoint about when that becomes
 a bottleneck and what we know how to do with control it happens to be abottleneck
 although we've gotten incredibly good solutions now but for a long time that ifelt that that was the key bottleneck
 in legged robots and roughly now the under actuated course isyou know me trying to tell people
 everything i can about how to make atlas do a backflipright
 i have a second course now in that i teach in the other semesters which ison on manipulation and that's where we
 get into now more of the that's a newer classi'm hoping to put it online this fall
 completely and uh that's going to have much more aspects about these perceptionproblems and the state representation
 questions and then how do you do control and the the thing that's a little bitsad
 is that uh for me at least is there's a lot of manipulation tasks that peoplewant to do and should want to do they
 could start a company with it and make verysuccessful that don't actually
 require you to think that much about under or dynamics at all evenbut certainly under actuated dynamics
 once i have if i if i reach out and grab something if itif i can sort of assume it's rigidly
 attached to my hand then i can do a lot of interesting meaningful things with itwithout really ever thinking about the
 dynamics of that object so they built we've built systems thatkind of
 reduced the need for that enveloping grasps and the likeum but i think the really good problems
 in manipulation so manipulation by the way is more thanjust pick and
 place that's like a lot of people think of that just graspingi don't mean that i mean buttoning my
 shirt i mean tying shoe laces how do you program a robot to tieshoelaces and not just one shoe but
 every shoe right that's a really good problem it's tempting to write down likethe infinite dimensional state of the
 of the laces that's probably not needed to write a good controlleri know we could hand design a controller
 that would do it but i don't want that i want tounderstand the principles
 that would allow me to solve another problem that's kind of like thatbut i think if we can stay pure in our
 approach then the challenge of tying anybody'sshoes


2:20:35
Speaker 1 :is a great challenge that's a great
 challenge i mean and the soft touch comes into play there that'sreally interesting
 let me ask another ridiculous question on this topic umhow important is touch we haven't talked
 much about humans but i have this argument with my dadwhere like i think you can fall in love
 with the robot based on uh language alone and hebelieves that
 touch is essential i touch and smell he says butum so
 in terms of robots you know connecting with humansand uh we can go philosophical in terms
 of like a deep meaningful connection likelove but even just like collaborating in
 an interesting way how important is touch likeuh from the engineering perspective and
 the philosophical one

2:21:31
Speaker 0 :i think it's super important let's even
 just in a practical sense if we forget about the emotionalpart of it but for robots to interact
 safely while they're doing meaningful mechanical work in the proin the you know close contact with or
 vicinity of people that need help i think we haveto have them
 they have we have to build them differently um they have to be afraidnot afraid of touching the world
 so uh i think baymax is just awesome that's justlike the the the movie of big hero 6 and
 the the concept of baymax that's justawesome i think we should
 and we have some folks at toyota that are trying to toyota research that aretrying to build baymax roughly
 and i think it's just a fantastically good projecti think it will change the way people
 physically interact the same way i mean you gave a coupleexamples earlier but but if i um
 if the robot that was walking around my home looks more like a teddy bearand a little less like the terminator
 that could change completely the way people perceive itand interact with it and maybe they'll
 even want to teach it like you said right you could um not quite gamify itbut somehow
 instead of people judging it and looking at it as if uhit's not doing as well as a human
 they're going to try to help out the cute teddy bearright who knows but i i think we're
 building robots wrong and being more soft and more contactis important right yeah and


2:23:07
Speaker 1 :like all the magical moments i can
 remember with robots well first of all just visiting your labseeing atlas
 but also spot menu when i first spot saw spot many in person and hung out withhim
 her uh it i don't have trouble engendering robots i feel roboticspeople really say always
 it i kind of like the idea that it's a her orhim uh there's a magical moment but
 there's no touching uh i guess the question i have have you ever been umlike have you had a human robot
 experience where like a robot touched youand like it was like wait like was there
 a moment that you've forgotten that a robotis a robot and like the
 anthropomorphization stepped in and for a second you forgotthat it's not human


2:24:03
Speaker 0 :i mean i think when you're in on the
 details then we we of course anthropomorphizedour work with atlas but in you know
 in verbal communication and the like i think we were pretty awareof it as a machine that needed to be
 respected um i actually i worry more about thesmaller robots that
 could still you know move quickly if programmed wrong and uhand we have to be careful actually about
 safety and the like right now and that if we build our robotscorrectly i think then
 those a lot of those concerns could go away and we're seeing that trend we'reseeing the lower
 cost lighter weight arms now that could befundamentally safe um
 i mean i do think touch is so fundamental ted adelsonis uh is great he's a perceptual
 scientist at mit and hestudied vision most of his life and he
 said when i had kids i expected to be fascinated bytheir perceptual development
 but what really what he noticed was felt more impressive more dominant was theway that they would
 touch everything and lick everything and pick things up stick it on their tongueand whatever
 and he said watching his daughter uh convinced him that actually he neededto study tactile sensing more
 so there's something very important i think it's a little bit alsoof the
 passive versus active part of the world right you canpassively perceive the world
 but it's fundamentally different if you can do an experiment rightand if you can change the world and you
 can learn a lot more than a passive observer soyou can in dialogue that was your
 initial example you could have an active experiment exchange but i thinkif you're just a camera watching youtube
 i think that's a very different problem than if you're arobot that can apply force and touch
 i i i think it's important

2:26:15
Speaker 1 :yeah i think it's just an exciting area
 of research i think you're probably right that this hasn't beenunder researched it's uh
 to me as a person who's captivated by the idea of human robot interactionit feels like such a rich
 opportunity to explore touch not even from a safety perspective but like yousaid the emotional
 too i mean safety comes first um but the next step is likeyou know uh like a real human connection
 even in the war like even in the industrial settingit just feels like uh it's nice for the
 robot i don't know i you know you mightdisagree with this but um
 because i think it's important to see robots as toolsoften but i don't know i think they're
 just always going to be more effective once you humanize themuh like it's convenient now to think of
 them as tools because we want to focus on the safetybut i think ultimately to create
 like a good experience for the worker for the personthere has to be a human element
 i don't know for me i i it feels like like an industrial robotic armwould be better if as a human element i
 think like we think robotics had that idea withbaxter and having eyes and so on having
 i don't know i'm a big believer in that

2:27:43
Speaker 0 :i it's not my area
 but i am also a big believer do you have

2:27:49
Speaker 1 :an emotional connection to atlas


2:27:51
Speaker 0 :

2:27:53
Speaker 1 :

2:27:56
Speaker 0 :like yeah do you miss him i mean
 yes i i i don't know if i'd more so than if i had a different science projectthat i'd worked on
 super hard right but uh um yeah i mean the robot we basically hadto do heart surgery on the robot in the
 final competition because we melted the coreum and uh and
 yeah there was something about watching that robot hanging there we know we hadto compete with it in an hour and it was
 getting its guts ripped out those are all historic

2:28:28
Speaker 1 :moments
 i think if we look back like 100 years from now

2:28:33
Speaker 0 :um yeah i think those are important


2:28:35
Speaker 1 :moments in robotics
 i mean these are the early day you look at like the early days of a lot ofscientific disciplines they look
 ridiculous they're full of failure but it feels like robotics will beimportant
 in the coming uh 100 years and these are the early days soso i think a lot of people are look at
 uh a brilliant person such as yourself andand are curious about the intellectual
 journey they've took um is there maybe three bookstechnical fiction philosophical that um
 had a big impact on your life that you would recommendperhaps others reading


2:29:17
Speaker 0 :yeah so um i actually didn't read that
 much as a kid but i read fairly voraciously now umthere are some recent books that if
 you're interested in this kind of topic like ai superpowers by kaifuli is just afantastic read
 you must read that um yuval harari is just i think thatcan open your mind um sapiens


2:29:44
Speaker 1 :

2:29:44
Speaker 0 :sapiens as as the first one homo deuce
 is the second yeah i think we mentioned the black swanby taleb i think that's a good sort of
 mind opener i actually umso so there's maybe a more controversial
 recommendation i could give um great well i would love somethingsure in some sense it's it's so
 classical it might surprise you but i actually recently read um mortimeradler's
 how to read a book not so long it was a while ago butsome people hate that book i
 loved it i think we're in this time right now whereum boy we're just inundated with
 research papers that you could read on archive withlimited peer review and just this wealth
 of information um i don't know i think thepassion of um what you can get out of a
 book a really good book or a really goodpaper if you find it
 the attitude the realization that you're only going to find a few that reallyare worth all your time but then
 once you find them you should just dig in and and andunderstand it very deeply and it's worth
 you know marking it up and and uh you know having the hard copywriting in the the side notes side
 margins um i think that was reallyit i read it at the right time where i
 was just feeling just overwhelmed with really low qualitystuff
 i guess and similarly uh i'm just giving more than three nowi'm sorry if i've exceeded my


2:31:34
Speaker 1 :my quota but on that topic just real
 quick is uh so basically finding a few companionsto keep for the rest of your life in
 terms of papers and books and so on and those are the ones like not doing umwhat is it fomo fear missing out
 constantly trying to update yourself but really deeply making a life journeyof studying a particular paper
 essentially

2:32:01
Speaker 0 :a set of papers yeah i think
 when you really find something which a book that resonates with you might notbe the same book that resonates with me
 but um when you really find one that resonates with you i think the dialoguethat happens
 and that's what i love that adler was saying you know i thinksocrates and plato say um
 the the written word is never going to capturethe beauty of dialogue right but adler
 says no no um a a really good bookis a dialogue between you and the author
 and it crosses time and space and uh i don't know i think it's a veryromantic there's a bunch of like
 specific advice which you can just gloss over but theromantic view of how to read and really
 appreciate it is is is so good and similarly teaching i uh umi thought a lot about teaching and uh
 and so isaac asimov great science fiction writer has alsoactually spent a lot of his
 career writing nonfiction right his memoir is fantastiche was passionate about explaining
 things right he wrote all kinds of books on all kinds of topics in sciencehe was known as the great explainer and
 some you know i i do really resonate with his styleand uh and just his way of
 talking about you know by communicating and explaining to something is reallythe way that you learn something i think
 i think about problems very differentlybecause of the way i've been
 given the opportunity to teach them at mitand we have questions asked you know the
 fear of the lecture the experience of the lecture and thequestions i get and the interactions
 just forces me to be rock solid on on these ideas in a way thati didn't have that i i don't know i
 would be in a different intellectual space

2:33:58
Speaker 1 :also video does that scare you that your
 lectures are online and people like me and sweatpants cansit sipping coffee and watch


2:34:06
Speaker 0 :what you give lectures that i think it's
 great i do think that something's changedright now which is
 you know right now we're giving lectures over zoomi mean giving seminars over zoom and
 everything um i'm trying to figure out i think it'sa new medium


2:34:24
Speaker 1 :do you think it's trying to figure out
 how to use it yeah i've been um i've beenquite um cynical
 about the human to human connection over over that medium but i think that'sbecause it's
 hasn't been explored fully and teaching is a different thing

2:34:45
Speaker 0 :every lecture is a is a i'm sorry every
 seminar even i think every talk i give i iyou know there's an opportunity to give
 that differently i can i can deliver content directly into yourbrowser you have a webgl
 engine right there i could i can throw 3duh content into your browser while
 you're listening to me right yeah and i can assume that you have a youknow at least a
 powerful enough laptop or something to watch zoom while i'm doing that whilei'm giving a lecture
 that that's a that's a new communication tool that i didn't have last yearright and uh i think robotics can
 potentially benefit a lot from teaching that waywe'll see it's going to be an experiment
 this fall i'm thinking a lot about it yeah and

2:35:30
Speaker 1 :also like
 um the the length of lectures or the length oflike um there's something so like i
 guarantee you you know it's like 80 percent of peoplewho started listening to our
 conversation are still listening to now which iscrazy to me
 but so there's a there's a patience and a interest in long-form contentbut at the same time there's a magic to
 forcing yourself to condense an idea to as short as possibleuh as short as possible like clip it can
 be part of a longer thing but like just like reallybeautifully condensed idea there's a lot
 of opportunity there that's easier to do and remote withi don't know uh with editing too
 editing is an interesting thing like what uhyou know most professors don't get when
 they give a lecture you don't get to go back and edit out partslike chris like crisp it up a little bit
 that's also it can do magic like if you remove like five to ten minutes from anhour lecture
 it can it can actually cr it can make something special of a lecture i've uhi've seen that in myself and and
 in others too because i edit other people's lectures to extract clipsit's like there's certain tangents
 they're like that lose they're not interesting they'rethey're they're mumbling they're just
 not they're not clarifying they're not helpful at alland once you remove them it's just i
 don't know editing can be magic uh take a lot oftime
 yeah it takes it depends like what is teaching you have to askum yeah because i find the editing
 process is also beneficial asuh for teaching but also for your own
 learning i don't know if have you watchedyourself in the survey
 have you watched those videos it's i

2:37:26
Speaker 0 :mean not all of them okay


2:37:28
Speaker 1 :it could be it could be painful yeah and
 to see like how to

2:37:32
Speaker 0 :improve so do you find that i know you
 segment your um your podcast do you think that helpspeople
 with the the attention span aspect of it or is it segment like

2:37:42
Speaker 1 :sections like yeah we're talking about


2:37:44
Speaker 0 :this topic whatever no


2:37:46
Speaker 1 :no that just helps me it's actually bad
 so uh and you've been incredible uh so i'm i'mlearning like i'm afraid of conversation
 this is even today i'm terrified of talking toyou i mean it's something
 i'm um trying to remove from myself i there's this a guy i mean i've learnedfrom a lot of people but
 really um there's been a few people who's been inspirational to me in termsof conversation
 whatever people think of him joe rogan has been inspirational to me becausecomedians have been too being able to
 just have fun and enjoy themselves and losethemselves in conversation
 that requires you to be a great storytellerto be able to uh pull a lot of different
 pieces of information together but mostly just to enjoy yourself inconversations i'm
 trying to learn that these notes are you see me looking downthat's like a safety blanket that i'm
 trying to let go of more and more cool so that's that people love justregular conversation
 that's what they the structure is like whateveri would say i would say maybe
 like 10 to like so there's a bunch of you knowthere's uh probably a couple thousand
 phd students listening to this right now right and they might know what we'retalking about
 but there's somebody i guarantee you right nowin russia some kid who's just like who's
 just smoke some weed is sitting back and justenjoying the hell out of this
 conversation not really understanding he kind of watched some boston dynamicsvideos he's just enjoying it
 um and i salute you sir uh no but just like there's aso much variety of people that just have
 curiosity about engineering about sciencesabout mathematics and um and also like i
 should

2:39:42
Speaker 0 :

2:39:43
Speaker 1 :that i mean uh enjoying it is one thing
 but i also often notice it inspires people tothere's a lot of people who are like in
 their undergraduate studies trying to figure out whatuh trying to figure out what to pursue
 and those these conversations can really spark the direction thereof their life and in terms of robotics i
 hope it does because uh i'm excited about the possibilities forrobotics brings on that
 topic um do you have advice like what advice would you give to ayoung person
 about life a young person about life or

2:40:18
Speaker 0 :a young person
 about life and robotics uh it could be

2:40:23
Speaker 1 :in robotics
 it could be in life in general it could be careerit could be uh relationship advice it
 could be running advice just like they're umthat's one of the things i see you like
 to talk to like 20 year olds they're they're like how do i how do ido this thing
 what do i do um if they come up to you

2:40:47
Speaker 0 :what would you tell them i think
 it's an interesting time to be a kid these dayseverything points to this being sort of
 a winner take all economy and the like i thinkthe people that will really excel
 in my opinion are going to be the ones that can think deeplyabout problems
 you have to be able to ask questions agilely and use the internet foreverything it's good for and stuff like
 this and i think a lot of people will develop those skillsi think the the leaders
 thought leaders you know robotics leaders whateverare going to be the ones that can do
 more and they can think very deeply and criticallyum and that's a harder thing to learn
 i think one one path to learning that is through mathematicsthrough engineering
 i would encourage people to start math early i mean ididn't really start i mean i was always
 in the the better math classes that i couldtake but i wasn't pursuing
 super advanced mathematics or anything like that until i got to mit i think mitlit me up and really started
 the life that i'm living now but yeah i really want kids to to dig deepreally understand things building things
 too i mean pull things apart put them back together like that's justsuch a good way to really
 understand things and expect it to be a long journey right it's uh you don'thave to know everything
 you're never gonna know everything so

2:42:29
Speaker 1 :think deeply and


2:42:31
Speaker 0 :stick with it enjoy the ride
 but just make sure you're not um yeah just just make sure you're you'reyou're stopping to think about why
 things work yeah it's true it's uh it's

2:42:43
Speaker 1 :easy to lose yourself in the
 in the in the distractions of the world

2:42:49
Speaker 0 :we're overwhelmed with content right now
 but you have to stop and pick some of it andreally understand


2:42:58
Speaker 1 :yeah on the book point i've read
 animal farm by george orwell a ridiculous number of times so for melike that book i don't know if it's a
 good book in general but for me it connects deeply somehowuh it somehow connects
 so i was born in the soviet union so it connects to me to the entirehistory of the soviet union and to world
 war ii and to the love and hatred and sufferingthat went on there
 and the uh the corrupting nature of power and greed andjust somehow i just that that that book
 has taught me more about life than like anything elseeven though it's just like a silly like
 childlike book about adam pigs it's like i don't know why itjust connects and inspires
 uh the same there's a few um yeah there's a few technical books tooand algorithms that just
 yeah you return too often right i'm i'm i'm with youuh yeah there's uh i don't and i've been
 losing that because of the internet i've been likeuh going and
 i've been going on archive and blog posts and githuband and the new thing and of um
 you lose your ability to really master an idea right

2:44:18
Speaker 0 :

2:44:20
Speaker 1 :wow exactly right what's a fond memory
 from childhood

2:44:27
Speaker 0 :when baby russ tedrick
 well i guess i just said that um at least my current life begins beganwhen i got to mit
 if i have to go farther than that yeah

2:44:38
Speaker 1 :what was was there life before mit


2:44:41
Speaker 0 :oh absolutely but but let me
 actually tell you what happened when i first got to mit because thati think might be relevant here but i
 yeah you know i i had taken a computer engineering degree at michigani enjoyed it immensely learned a bunch
 of stuff i was i liked computers i liked how to like programmingum but when i did get to mit and started
 working with sebastian sung theoretical physicist computationalneuroscientist
 um the culture here was just different um it demanded more of me certainlymathematically
 and in the critical thinking and i rememberthe day that i uh borrowed one of the
 books from my advisor's office and walked down tothe charles river and was like
 i'm getting my butt kicked you know um and i think that's going to happen toeverybody who's doing this kind of stuff
 right i think uh i expected you to ask me the meaning oflife you know i think that the uh
 um somehow i think that's that's gotta be part of itthis doing hard things


2:45:55
Speaker 1 :yeah did you uh did you consider
 quitting at any point did you consider this isn't for me

2:45:59
Speaker 0 :no never that i mean i was
 it was working hard but i was loving it right there'si think the there's this magical thing
 where you you know i'm lucky to surround myselfwith people that basically
 almost every day i'll i'll i'll see something i'll be told something orsomething that i realize wow i don't
 understand that and if i could just understand that there's there'ssomething else to learn that if i could
 just learn that thing i would connect another piece of thepuzzle and and uh
 you know i think that is just such an importantaspect and being willing to
 understand what you can and can't do and andloving the journey of going and learning
 those other things i think that's the best part i don't

2:46:46
Speaker 1 :think there's a
 better way to end it or us i've um you've been aninspiration to me since i showed up at
 mit uh your work has been an inspiration tothe world this conversation was amazing
 i can't wait to see what you do next with robotics home robots ii hope to see you work in my home one

 and now let me leave you with some words from neil degrasse tysontalking about robots in space and the
 emphasis we humans put on human-based space explorationrobots are important if i don my pure
 scientist hat i would say just send robots i'll staydown here and get the data
 but nobody's ever given a parade for a robot nobody's ever nameda high school after a robot so when i
 down my public educator hat i have to recognize the elements ofexploration that excite people
 it's not only the discoveries and the beautiful photos that come down from theheavens
 it's the vicarious participation in discovery itselfthank you for listening and hope to see
