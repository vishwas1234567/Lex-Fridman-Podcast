Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 ryan hall one of the most insightful minds and systems thinkers in themartial arts world
 he's a black belt in jiu jitsu accomplished competitoran mma fighter undefeated in the ufc
 and truly a philosopher who seeks to understand the underlying principlesof the martial arts jiu jitsu is such an
 important part of who i am and i was hoping to share that withfolks who might know me only as a
 researcher i think there's no better person to dothat with than ryan who somehow
 remarkably i can say is a friend and alsoa modern day warrior philosopher of the
 miyamoto masashi line of especially dangerous and brillianthumans

 really didn't anticipate was so empoweringespecially for someone who's trying to
 find their voice i hope you'll allow me the chance toreally try and do that to step outside
 of ai and even science engineering history andso on
 and on occasion talk to athletes musicianswriters and maybe even comedians
 who inspire me especially up and coming comedians and musicians like ericweinstein
 who yes we'll do a third conversation with sooni think if i allow myself to expand the
 range of these conversations on occasion when i do return to science andengineering i'll bring a new perspective
 and also a little bit more fun and a few extra listeners that may nototherwise
 realize how fascinating artificial intelligence robotics mathematics andengineering truly is all that said

 electrical muscle stimulation device in reading that bruce lee used ithe was an inspiration to me as someone
 who practices first principles thinkingespecially in a discipline where
 conventional thinking is everywhere he created a martial art called jeetkune do that is in many ways
 at least philosophically in his hybrid approach a precursorto modern day mixed martial arts there's
 a special kind of deep philosophical thinking thatcombat athletes or jiu jitsu
 practitioners do that is unlike any other i think it'sgrounded in the

 into that kind of life expensive things nice restaurants carsall that
 i was thinking about what song's equivalent in english maybeuptown girl by billy joe is similar in
 spirit but very different in style i justwatched the video on youtube
 for uptown girl and it's basically billy joeldressed up as a mechanic but dancing in
 a way that i'm pretty sure no mechanic has ever dancedturning the old cringe factor up to 11.

 warrior in history ancient or modern that's a tough

0:07:26
Speaker 0 :question and
 again i'm no historian by any measure so i'll probably do the worstlike what are your best bands ever i'm
 like metallica and you know so i'll pick

0:07:36
Speaker 1 :the
 material could just come out with a new album by the way entire

0:07:40
Speaker 0 :orchestra that's that's kind of cool


0:07:42
Speaker 1 :yeah them metallica will
 will always be one of the greatest yeah

0:07:45
Speaker 0 :i agree with that example
 if they were a well-known yet awesome band let me say it's like a nickelbackor something like that
 but i feel that feels cheap because everyone makes fun of nickelback yeah idon't know i guess
 it depends on how you want to define warrior something to think aboutwhen it comes to trying to evaluate
 various people or situations or things that i'veread about or heard about are
 with the circumstances that they were involved in because i think a lot oftimes it's easy to look at the outcomes
 and obviously outcome we live in an outcome-driven world and you knowoutcomes do matter but at the same time
 like uh you know you look at let's say whatcuba's been able to pull off
 you know from a combat sports perspective it's it's staggering youknow like the amount of
 successful olympic level competitors they have in wrestling boxing judoum i mean they're a tiny little island
 with no money and no people it's that's shocking you know when you comeyou think about the olympics in the
 united states doing well of course we should do well i meanrussia should do well china should do
 well india should do better than they do honestly obviouslyit means like they're not into it as
 much or at least certain sports because they have the resourcespeople-wise um so talent's not going to


0:08:49
Speaker 1 :be an issue
 so there's something to like where the starting point is like that's theargument with like uh
 what people say maradona i don't know if you're into it oh yeah big soccer okaythey say mardon is better than messi
 because he basically carried the team and andwon the world cup with the team that
 wouldn't otherwise win the world cup and then messi was only successful inbarcelona because uh
 he has like superstars he's playing with other superstars

0:09:17
Speaker 0 :right yeah that's fair to say i mean
 like like united there's a lot of factors that go into let's say winning awinning a soccer game and you know
 obviously barcelona you know particularly for various points in timehad a
 ridiculous all-star squad of world-class players butum and i you know let's say for instance
 maybe they didn't have the creative players in argentina they needed to getthe ball up to messi
 you know they didn't have like the nes the and you know theyou know the again the backing there in
 the midfield but um because obviously argentina's always hadridiculous attacking players like even
 alongside messi but they're like the three killers up front and thena little less behind so it's interesting


0:09:50
Speaker 1 :you say
 that it depends how you define warrior because you can probably take likesome of the civil rights leaders you can
 go into that direction like leaders in generalbut if we just look at like the greatest
 martial artist in history in that direction do you have somebody in

0:10:06
Speaker 0 :mind i would say at least three
 three that pop into my head and um would beuh hannibal um alexander the great and
 then maybe miyamoto musashi um you know thetwo commanders and then one
 you know guy but uh so it's it's interesting and thenagain you mentioned warriors being able
 to make a lot out of a little uh you know musashi's famous for winningduels you know that were
 oftentimes one there were one-on-one you know the alexanderand hannibal were you know military
 commanders and one of them faced rome and that was an interesting thingoftentimes you know coming up with novel
 tactics different strategies sometimes underresourced
 doing having to do novel and crazy things there's skin in the gamethat's an interesting thing too i think
 a lot of times you know it's uh if you're playing a video game i don'tthink you can be a warrior because
 there's there's no skin in the game you get hurtyou lose and it's a bummer it stings a
 little bit maybe it makes you feel slightly disappointed but uhyou know musashi loses he loses um
 hannibal loses he loses alexander loses he loses and theylose i guess the people around them lose
 so that's almost like uh you could use even from a combat sportsperspective a muhammad ali i mean you
 consider also their quality of opposition musashiwas fighting high quality opposition
 obviously hannibal and al alexander particularly hannibal were fightingunbelievable opposition
 muhammad ali fought phenomenal opposition but he had skin in the gameboth in the ring and out
 and that actually meshes with as you mentioned like a civil rights you knowtype of situation where
 you are under resourced you're pushing the stone uphilland that was a neat thing i think about
 muhammad ali was how much you know personal convictionthe man had to have in order to pull off
 what he was able to pull off both in in and outside of the ring and thatreminds me of
 of again some of the other great leaders or great fighters throughout history so

0:11:48
Speaker 1 :what do you make of
 the kind of very difficult idea that some of these conquerors like alexanderthe great
 and somebody that uh if you listen to hardcore historyoh dan carlin uh who apparently elon
 musk is also a big fan of is the genghis khan episodeyou know a large
 percent of the world is uh is uh we can call genghis khan anancestor
 so the difficult truth is about some of these conquerors is that there's a lotof murder
 and rape and pillage and stealing of resources and all that kind of stuffand yet they're often remembered as
 quite honorable i mean in the case of genghis khan there's a lot of people whoargue if you look at the
 historically the way it's described in full contextis he was ultimately like a
 given the time he was a liberator he was uhhe was a progressive i should say uh you
 know like in terms of the the violence and the atrocities hecommitted
 he at least in the stories has always provided the optionof not to do that it's only if you
 resist do you basically have the option do youwant to join us or do you want to die
 and die horribly and so that's the progressive sort of uh that'sthe bernie sanders of the era
 nice so uh what do you make of that that there's just so muchof these great conquerors there's so
 much murder that to us now would just seeminsane


0:13:33
Speaker 0 :it's funny you mentioned it i think that
 maybe it's a human nature thing that we want to uh or youknow maybe or
 maybe a misunderstanding thing that we want to cast all of our charactersand ourselves maybe as entirely good or
 as entirely negative when you know i guess i was the phraseor the saying you know one man's freedom
 fighter is another person's terrorist um is accurate and a lot of times ithink
 you can understand as long as you're able to look from various people'sperspective like if you look at
 the tv show the wire um which was obviously you know widely everybodyloves the wire
 um i thought that they were everyone i mean i'm not saying anything that'sthat's not been said before compelling
 characters from all angles whether you like the characterdislike the character you were able to
 understand the motivations of people doing various things even if they didwrongly they did rightly
 you know we want to cast all of the the demons throughout history as ascompletely inhuman when i think that
 makes it difficult for us to understand them and we want to lookback at at the people that we think of
 as great um and entirely great and i think thatwe're you know we're experiencing
 the problems with this you know even right now socially and politically aswe're trying to look back and decide the
 people we thought were good or not good or people we thought were bad and nowgood
 rather than going hey there's there's good and bad to all things and there areas you mentioned the genghis khan thing
 you don't have to fight back you do i respect you for it but thenwe're gonna have a conflict and then
 we'll see what happens and if you lose you're going to be sorry that you didbecause i have to make it that way if i
 want to continue utilizing this this kind of mobecause i need to discourage the next
 guy from doing what you're doing right nowand ultimately though i guess that's an
 interesting thing imagine you put every single person on planet earth in a cagecrime drops you know uh all sorts there
 are certain positives to that and i it's just things are as they areit's difficult but that is ultimately
 more the law of the jungle and i think that we're able to supersede some ofthat
 now in modern times and i think we're fortunatebut as you mentioned we look back and
 say oh this is horrible say no that that just is what it isthat's how life
 is at a base level and you know again if you're a lion and i'm a gazelle i don'ti don't really like it very much but we
 don't call the lion the bad guy we don't sanctify the gazelle or theother way around so it's just it's
 interesting when you pull back some of the controls that we put onour behavior and you know in modern life
 which i think are generally speaking positiveyou know we get down to how things often
 are and at the same time we could modern lifewas built by people like genghis khan
 so then you get down to the ends just to find the means it's a tough questionthese aren't things with easy answers at
 least if they are i certainly don't have thethe smarts to figure out the answers to
 them but uh it's it's difficult i would just saypeople in the world are complicated and
 layered and depending upon which side of the line you're standing on at varioustimes
 you know um you may like or dislike someone but i can't remember uhit's i can't remember who's whose idea
 was this is killing me but it's the veil of ignorance i guessum the philosophical you know um you
 know idea of the veil of ignorance where i go isis sticking everyone in the cage the
 right thing to do when i say or everyone but me and i say wellno why well it would make my life easier
 if i just went over and took all of your stuff as long as you couldn't stop mei mean of course that's a great idea
 that's what everyone does in every video game but uh in skyrim you steal stuffwhen people aren't around
 but um ultimately you go well this isn't the right thing to do because if i wereon the other side of it
 i would i would not appreciate it it's it's inherently not a good thing to doi'm only doing it because i think i'm
 going to win and that's a fine way to be but you don't have the white hat on iguess i would say so
 i think without those philosophical underpinnings to reign us inyou know i guess morally speaking it's
 very difficult to say what's right or wrong andyou'd say certain actions have a
 reaction almost like a physics sense if you kill everyone in your way for aslong as you're able to
 your life will be easier i mean you're setting the table for someone doing thesame to you when you're no longer the
 tough guy but

0:17:32
Speaker 1 :it is what it is yeah if you look at
 like the instagram channel nature's metal it hurts my heart towatch
 to remind me a comfortable descendant of ape how vicious nature isjust unapologetically
 uh just i mean there's a there's a process to itwhere the bad guy always wins
 the the violence is the solution to most problems orthe flip side of that running away from
 violence is the solution depending on your skill setand it's funny to think of us humans
 with our extra little piece of brain that we're somehow tryingto figure out
 like you said in the philosophical way how to supersede that how to like movepast the viciousness the cruelty
 the just the cold exchange of nature but perhaps it's notso
 maybe that is nature maybe that's the way of life maybe we're trying too hardto uh we're being too
 egotistical and thinking we're somehow separate from nature we're somehowdistant from that very thing


0:18:46
Speaker 0 :i couldn't agree with him more in fact i
 think actually orson scott card you know who's the writer of a great book calledanders game
 um was this was a statement that the main characteryou know ender uh made in the book his
 brother was brilliant um his brother was like kindof sociopathic brilliant kid
 that was ended up kicked out of the school that they were all into forbattle commander
 dealing with his brother taught him that ultimately strength couragethe ability to do violence for all the
 good and the bad of that is one of the fundamental most importantthings to be able to do in life because
 if you can't cause destruction if you can't cause painyou will be forever subject to those who
 can and i think that you mentioned egotism i think that that's a diseasethat could
 obviously strike any of us but it's something that we're looking at nowwe're
 you know i think we should be unbelievably thankful as people thatlive
 in the world that we do um that we can walk down the streetwithout having to worry that i'm like
 well don't worry that that six foot six 270 pound person over thereis just gonna leave me alone and i have
 a rolex on but whatever i'll be fine because that person'sdeciding to leave me alone because we've
 all agreed to live in this relatively you know sane and or you knowconstrained society because it benefits
 all of us and we're doing it because of a philosophical underpinningnot because nature dictates it be that
 way because nature dictates it go in a very very different direction and theonly person the only thing stopping that
 person from doing something to me is either me that person or someone elsethat will stand in between us
 and if i can't do it and there's no one there to stand in between usthen the only thing stopping that person
 is that person and i have to hope that they'reeither disinterested or disinclined to
 do that sort of thing and i think that uhyou know it's keeping in mind that that
 that is the fundamental nature of the world whether we like itor not um
 is important and i think the the quest tofundamentally alter human nature is
 going to be ultimately fruitless and then also it'sit is a little bit egotistical the lion
 does what a lion does you know we we can try to box it in andwe can try to you know
 guide this direction that direction but you knownature is as it is and as it always will
 be unless we want to start to constrain it significantly but now i'mstarting to get into individual rights
 who put me in charge who says that i should be the one to make the choice isconstraining because many of the most
 awful things that have happened throughout history one group or oneperson has decided to constrain others
 and we don't like genghis khan doing that well i'll do that on a little levelare there going to be beneficial
 benefits and beneficiaries absolutely butthere'll be losers in that too so i
 guess it's a it's a dangerous game it's almost like putting on the one ring youknow we remember when frodo offered the
 one ring to gandalf and gandalf said no no i would take itaway i would put it on
 i would use it out of the desire to do good but through me it would wheel thepower so terrible you can't imagine
 i think that's that's the big question for anyone that decidesthat's able to have reach and able to
 have power i mean obviously i can't speak to thatbut imagine you did have
 national level global level power how would you use itwould you try to change the world would
 you be glad that you did down the line

0:21:49
Speaker 1 :i don't know yeah there's uh i mean
 that's the thing we're struggling now as a society maybe it'd be nice to get yourquick comment on that which is um the
 people who have traditionally been powerlessare now you know seeking a fairer
 society a more equal society andin in attaining more power
 justly there's also a realization at least from myperspective that
 power corrupts everyone even if you're even if the flag you wave is thatof of justice right
 and so you know not to overuse the term but it'd be niceif you have thoughts about the whole
 idea of cancer culture and the internet and and twitter and so onwhere there's
 on nuance difficult discussions of uh of race of gender offairness equality justice all these
 kinds of things there's a shouting down oftentimes ofnuanced discussion
 of kind of trying to reason through these very difficultissues through our history through what
 our future looks like do you have thoughts about the internetdiscourse that's going on now
 is there something positive yeah i mean we can pull out of this

0:23:15
Speaker 0 :it's an interesting thing to see i guess
 as you mentioned anytime you're wielding power whomeveryou are
 doing so carefully is is important and it's very very easy to look at thepeople that have power
 and that are using it poorly or have used it poorly and go hey you're the badguy
 and then go well of course if i had power i'll use it properly and i mayintend to use it properly and maybe i
 will but at the same time we seea lot of times people are people are
 people i think that a lot of the i think if you if youbelieve that that
 human beings are all one which i do you know no matter whether you're hereyou're there you're you're
 you got two arms two legs a heart a brain if we all live a similarexperience
 you know and obviously with variations on a theme but uhyou know you're no less a human being if
 you're a person i've never met from china than thansome person in virginia it's we're all
 we're all people and i guess ultimately if i believe that humanbeings are corruptable and that power
 corrupts and that we're all fallible and we sayand do things that either intentionally
 or unintentionally um that we wish we'd not umi think that i have to allow for a
 space i guess with the word it's almost a religious term but i guess i wouldjust say grace
 and that's something that i see disappearing from discourse in thepublic or maybe it wasn't there i'm not
 sure but it's interesting you know watching this occuron the internet because also now no
 longer are you and i just having a talk sitting on aon a bus stop it's now in writing
 everything's in writing the old the old saying like don't put that in writingyou're like don't put anything in
 writing that's how you get in trouble and basically uh you know with with thedegree to which everything is recorded
 but recorded in tiny little bytes it's very very easy for me to waveevery less little foolish ignorant
 incorrect or correct thing that someone has ever said or done intheir face to support whatever
 argument that i'm trying to make about them or a situationand i think that you mentioned cancel
 culture or you know as it seems to exist obviouslythis is poisonous on its face this is
 poisonous um it's it's the sort of thing thatdoesn't incentivize
 proper behavior i mean you look at let's say one of the great monstersof history adolf hitler obviously who's
 done awful awful things but also for anyonethat's even a minor student of history
 did some positive things as well we don't have to i don't have toembroider this person's crimes i don't
 have to act as if there was nothing good amonster has ever done and
 nothing bad that that a great person throughout history has ever donebut imagine the ghost of adolf hitler
 were to pop up and go oh my gosh guys i'm so sorry i i knowwhat i've done
 but i'd like to apologize and start to make it right well i mean you'd hopethat you
 you know if he popped up over here you go well i don't really like what you'vedone
 and i don't like you but at the same time i'm glad to hear that you'reattempting to
 make this right and push in a positive direction even if you can't make itright because otherwise
 what am i doing i'm disincentivizing change for the betteri'm i'm looking to wield whatever power
 i have in a punitive fashion um which does not encourage people to doanything other than double down
 on on the wrongs that they've made knowing that at least they're going tohave some
 support from the people that support that and i guess i want toyou you hopefully look at the use of the
 internet as a tool that can educate and i guess i don't like theword empower but empower people to do
 various things extend their reach but uh but educate and learn rather thanto further solidify
 little tribal things that exist which i think everyone in humanity andhuman history is is vulnerable to me
 look at the course of human history it's deeply tribaland the tribes or the groups that have
 been on top at various points in time have donea lot of times bad things to the ones
 that have not and you'd hope that we could learn lessonsfrom the past and rather than
 you know committing the crimes that were you know that were committedagainst us recommitting them when we
 slide into the top position um say you know i could do this now buti'll not you know i understand the urge
 to to seek vengeance is strong of anyonethat says differently i don't i wouldn't
 trust you know but at the same time we go i'vewe we have enough experience in history
 enough experience in life enough hopefully wisdom you know time in to gothis isn't the right answer
 this is only going to replay the things the the worst parts of our history notthe best
 and i want to encourage positive behavior and if i justagain further lash out at people
 although understandably done done understandably i'm simply justgoing to just perpetuate the cycle
 that's gone on to this point so you hope that even though we'reseeing a lot of a lot of turmoil
 societally at the moment and globally at the moment that uhi guess our better angels can prevail at
 a certain point but it's going to take a great deal of leadership and i thinkthat we're
 we're sorely missing like a martin luther king style character at themoment or a great leader
 and i just i'm hoping that one will show up

0:28:04
Speaker 1 :for sure and by the way a word i don't
 hear often and i think it's a beautiful one which is gracethat's a really interesting word i'm
 gonna have to think about that it is there is a religious component to it butit's exactly right
 it um you have to somehow walk the line between you know you mentioned hitleri've been reading uh the rise and fall
 of the third reich i'm really thinking about the 1930sand what it's like to have economic
 my concern is the economic pain that people are feeling nowquietly is really a suffering
 that's not being heard and there's echoes of thatin the in the 20s and the 30s with the
 great depression and there's a hunger for a charismaticleader like you said there's a leader
 that could walk with grace could inspirecould uh
 could bring people together with uh with sort of uhdreams of a better future that's
 positive but hitler did exactly everything that ijust said except for the word positive
 which is he did give a dream to the german people who weregreat people who are great people of um
 of a better future it's just that a certain point that quickly turned intothe better future requires
 literally expansion of more land it started with well if we want to builda great germany
 we need a little bit more land and so we need to kind ofget austria then we need to kind of get
 france mostly because france doesn't understand that more land is reallyuseful so we need to get rid of them and


0:29:58
Speaker 0 :look what they did to us in versailles
 anyway

0:30:01
Speaker 1 :but so the jew the jewish uh
 the holocaust is a separate thing i don't know well i don't know idon't know what to think about
 because uh so me being jewish and having a lot ofthe echoes of the suffering is in my
 family or the people that are lost i don't knowbecause hitler wrote all about it in
 mineconf so i don't know if the evil he committed was there allalong
 i mean and that that's where the question of forgivenessi mean hitler's such a difficult person
 to talk about but it's the question of on cancer culturewho is deserving of forgiveness and
 who's not like the holocaust survivors that i'veread about that i've heard the
 interviews with they've often spoken about the fact thatthe way for them to let go to overcome
 the atrocities that they've experienced is to forgive like forgivenessis the way out for them it's interesting
 to think about i don't know i don't know ifi don't know if we're even a society
 ready to even contemplate an idea of forgiveness for hitler it'sit's an interesting idea though
 it was it's a good thought exercise at the very leastto think about like all these people
 that are being canceled for doing bad things of differentdegrees
 think of like louis ck or somebody like that for beingnot a good person but like what is the
 path for forgiveness

0:31:42
Speaker 0 :so what's a good person what is the good
 part if that's a sliding scale that we could all find ourselves lookingat the
 uncomfortable end of a gun on you know particularly down the line i mean youhope for the best but
 these definitions i guess like you said are important and who's doing thecanceling who's being canceled i'm not
 necessarily as you said saying that that's entirely unjustifiedor certainly not
 it's certainly understandable and particularly you mentioned like amonster like an adolf hitler but it's
 also interesting i couldn't help but notice likeyou mentioned as a society us being able
 to apply forgiveness to someone who's done so much horrorbut people who are personal i'm of
 course many so many people in person affected but directly personallyaffected someone a survivor of the
 holocaust being able to let go on that i'm nowherenear big enough a person for that sort
 of thing but i guess that's that's an interestingthing
 you know being the person who was physically therepotentially able to able to let go
 i don't know that's that's unbelievably powerful it's interesting i guess youhave to wonder sometimes
 and this isn't obviously in regards to that to the holocaust butwhy why i'm holding on to various things
 am i what is it doing for me and what is itdoing to me is it facilitative is it not
 and i guess that's something else that i i really enjoy when i was on ultimatefighter
 they uh they don't let you have any music or any books other than religioustext so i brought a bible and i brought
 a quran and i started to read them side by side and it was it was reallyinteresting reading the bible's a little
 drier quran's the crown is more interesting atleast written but um
 i i think something that that was consistently brought up uhwas the way the
 most merciful people want i don't think any of us want justicewe think we want justice but i don't
 think we want justice justice is a dangerous dangerous dangerous gamebecause maybe this person's wronged me
 deeply and i i want justice i want to balance it out because what is justiceis not a balancing of the scales
 and sometimes you can understand it on a societal level i think it's fine i meanthere's
 crime and punishment we can go for the benefits and the drawbacks of that buti think what any of us want is mercy
 within reason you know grace as you mentioned becausejustice is a very very very dangerous
 thing and it's a valuable and important thingbut who gets to decide what's just
 what justice is actually meted out maybe i get to meet out justice but it's noti don't get my comeuppance well that
 sounds great but what happens when it's pointed back at meand uh i guess that comes back to the
 veil of ignorance you know the idea that that one day iwill have to live in the world in which
 i've envisioned the world in which i've created i ithink that a lot of times people love
 the idea of uh they're a judge for your crimes and alawyer for theirs and
 i heard that the other day i thought it was great and uh i think that's itthat's a
 dangerous thing and hopefully it gives us all pause before rightly or wronglybut always understandably you know
 wielding wielding

0:34:30
Speaker 1 :serious power yeah justice is a kind of
 drug so if you look at history also been reading a lot about stalin imean all those
 folks really i don't know i don't know what was inside hitler's head actuallythat he's a tricky one
 because i think he was legitimately insane stalin was notand stalin was like he literally thought
 he's doing a good thing he literally thought for theentirety of the time
 that communism is going to bring like that's the utopiaand he's going to create a happy world
 and in his in his mind were ideas of justice of fairness of happiness of ofuh
 yeah human flourishing and that's that's a drugand it somehow sadly pollutes the mind
 when you start thinking like that what's good for societyand believing that you have a good sense
 of what's good for society that's intoxicating especially whenothers around you are feeling the same
 way and then you start like building up thismovement and you forget
 that you are just like a you're you're likebarely recently evolved from an ape like
 you don't know what the hell you're doingand then you start like killing witches
 or whatever like you start

0:35:51
Speaker 0 :you start doing they did math let's be
 honest though i mean sometimes you got a witch has to go

0:35:57
Speaker 1 :yeah we can all agree there which which
 has to go if if it floats or sinks which one i forget

0:36:02
Speaker 0 :which which
 whichever one we need at the time honestly it's floating it should have

0:36:06
Speaker 1 :sunk
 uh yeah but yeah we can definitely agree that we just have to gobecause you brought it up i uh tweeted
 recently but also just i'm one of the things i'mreally ashamed of in my life is
 i haven't really read almost any of the sci-fi classicsreally yeah so like i my whole journey
 through reading was through like theliterary philosophers that would say
 like camus jesse dostoevsky kafka like that place like that's a kindof sci-fi world
 in itself but it's it just it creates a world in which thethe deepest questions about human nature
 can be explored i didn't realize this but the sci-fiworld is the same it just puts it in a
 it like removes it from any kind of historicalcontext where you can explore those same
 ideas in like space somewhere elsewhere in adifferent time a different place
 it allows you almost like more freedom to like construct theseartificial things where you can just do
 crazy uh crazy kind of human experiments soi'm now
 working through it uh the books on my listare the foundation series by isaac
 asimov dune snow crashby neil stephenson and ender's game like
 you mentioned that's just kind of and then so i postedthat and then of course like
 elon musk john uh carmack i don't know if you know him creator of doom andquake
 oh cool so see they all pitched in these nerdsthese ultra nerds just started like
 going like did these uh do you need to read this that and andthe other so
 i've like started working out okay but it seems like the list i've mentionedholds up somewhat is there a book is
 there sci-fi books or series orauthors that that you find
 are just amazing maybe another way to ask that is likewhat's the greatest sci-fi book of all


0:38:14
Speaker 0 :time well i'd like to start by
 sharing something that i i'm embarrassed about is that i haven't read anythingother than uh you know orson scott card
 j.r tolkien uh frank herbert tolkien yeah dudeyep yeah yeah i'm aware through
 wikipedia and uh through through surface readingof things that like a book called the
 republic was written once um yeah there were some othermotherboards


0:38:41
Speaker 1 :you're uh a prolific reader of wikipedia
 articles well

0:38:44
Speaker 0 :or occasionally
 uh whatever else it is that i waste my time on but but yeah so

0:38:51
Speaker 1 :i also i should say i posted on reddit
 questions for uh ryan hall and there's like amillion questions
 but like uh half of them have to do with dune no not really but likepeople bring up doom i don't understand
 why i did you mentioned doom before

0:39:05
Speaker 0 :well i actually actually have a showy
 roll actually made us a ghee a dune themed ghee one time which i thought waskind of cool i'll send you i'll give you
 one we got extras but uh actually to your to your pointactually this is a orson scott card
 quote actually the writer of bender's game um fiction because it's not aboutsomebody who actually lived in the real
 world always has the possibility of beingabout oneself
 and i think that's a neat thing because i i have heard you knowother very people whom i respect and
 very sharp people actually every now and then dig theirheels and go i don't like fiction i only
 like non-fiction it's more it's more instructive and i would goi completely disagree with that i think
 we have a hard enough time figuring out what happened at 7 11three hours ago that let me tell you
 what happened 600 years bc i'm like hey i'm interested butdon't tell me this isn't a story too
 yeah there's a there's there's actu there's factual components i have nodoubt
 but we struggle sometimes to like i guess what i like aboutfiction is that you can tell me a story
 it's all about people i mean every night there's more and lessbelievable things um and i think dune
 would be an unbelievably well written in my opinion for to run you know whatdo i know but i really like doing i'll
 say that uh well-written example of you knowhuman beings interacting with one
 another the political component to that theemotional the intellectual
 the relationship components all of that and uh i i think that dune is neatbecause it's a sci-fi novel but only in
 the only in the loosest sense it's it'sreally a story about
 religion about group dynamics about human potentialabout um belief learning
 politics governance ecology it's uh the best stories remind meof history the same way history
 hopefully is not just a a list of facts that i try to be able to recallor factoids that i try to recall but a
 story that i can understand and and see howhow the threads of
 time kind of came together and created certain things and a lot of times likewe say i'm like uh how the heck is
 what's going on right now or a hundred years from now or a hundred years in thepast happened
 and you can look back far enough if we had accurate knowledgeif we had that like that hypothetical
 perfect pool shot you know at the beginning of time we would see anunbroken chain of events that led us to
 where we are and and where we are will potentiallylead us to where we're going which is
 again why hindsight's helpful but i think it's neat likei guess i really enjoy for instance a
 book like dune and they're actually making a movie out of it which i'mi'm skeptical of to be honest because
 it's it's going to be difficult to bring that to the screen for a variety ofreasons but


0:41:32
Speaker 1 :there's at least 100 questions ask ryan
 what do you think's about the new dune

0:41:35
Speaker 0 :movie i am not enough of an authority to
 have any sort of decent opinion but i guess what i would say is so much of itgoes on in the character's mind like how
 much of any of our day is any lived experience as it wereis internal
 the majority how many times are people walking around and you know they can youcould
 like hey what do you see right now i'm like oh well i see this picture i see awall hey there's lex
 but really what what i was paying attention to was what was going oninside of my head for a moment and
 almost the rest of the world tuned out and kind of dimmed and uhyeah i guess um that i think that's
 going to be a struggle to to any time you want to bring that typeof a written story to
 to a visual medium i think it's going to be more difficult butit'll it'll be interesting it's
 definitely my one of my favorite stories and it's beenit's honestly helped me become better at
 life in my opinion better the martial artsand i think the the writer i think frank
 herbert was absolutely brilliant whether those were all his ideas which inreality none of us or all of our good
 ideas aren't ours we're a combination maybe came up with something you're acurator of other good ideas and
 some things you borrowed from somewhere without even realizing it but uhi think the the way the messages and the
 themes and the ideas that were conveyed particularly in the original novel orjust


0:42:45
Speaker 1 :absolutely brilliant is that the is that
 to you one of the greats and and the flip sideof that like or
 another way to ask that is like if somebody's new to sci-fi is thatsomething you would recommend
 that that is an entry point i'm not well

0:42:58
Speaker 0 :read enough in this sci-fi world i
 haven't written a lot of like isaac asimov or anything like that buti just i'll recommend dune i'll be an
 obnoxious like evangelist for dune to anyone who'll listenokay so i yeah i would strongly


0:43:10
Speaker 1 :recommend it so the other thing you
 mentioned now i should probably be talking to youabout much more important things but
 the other thing you mentioned is skyrim uh do you play video games what's yourfavorite game what's
 what would you say is the greatest video game of all time because i'm a huge fanof elder scrolls oh


0:43:27
Speaker 0 :yeah i mean i play a little bit um at
 this point you know a little little less uh finallymoved into a new house so


0:43:34
Speaker 1 :

0:43:35
Speaker 0 :you're like an adult no no no no i'm
 like a better funded 12 year old yeah that's yeah that's entirely that'sentirely accurate better funded 12 year
 old but um somewhat better funded12-year-old not as well-funded as i wish
 but historically did you play video

0:43:49
Speaker 1 :

0:43:50
Speaker 0 :games oh yeah i played as a kid i was
 you know again i've always liked playing sports and and liked readingand i always enjoy video games but my
 favorite video game i think i've ever played was uhnicely the old republic um it was a star
 wars game a huge star wars fan until it became less so so recently disneyum you don't like the i haven't watched


0:44:08
Speaker 1 :it yet oh my
 my delorean oh dog oh i actually like

0:44:11
Speaker 0 :mandalorian that was that was actually
 pretty good yeah waving this off yeah yeah i will if icould cancel
 one thing i would cancel disney store

0:44:20
Speaker 1 :i'm gonna edit that part out okay let's
 go to the next but uh this is where if people arewondering if you're watching this on
 youtube and like the dislike amount is like 80percent it's because of that comment so
 good job good job for making the

0:44:34
Speaker 0 :internet hey nothing now what about


0:44:36
Speaker 1 :uh baby yoda yeah i guess


0:44:39
Speaker 0 :like he's little he's got ears and he
 uses the force sometimes and he passes out againno qualms with baby yoda yeah you don't


0:44:46
Speaker 1 :have a heart okay


0:44:48
Speaker 0 :

0:44:49
Speaker 1 :i the let's go to jiu jitsu if it's okay
 uh so the audience of this podcast may notknow much about jiu jitsu or they do
 because it's really part of the culture now but they don'treally know much they see that so many
 people have fallen in love with it have been transformed through it but theydon't know much about like
 what is this thing is there a way you could sort oftry to explain the what is jiu jitsu
 what is the essence of this martial art that'scaptured the minds and hearts of so many
 people in the world

0:45:22
Speaker 0 :i think that jiu jitsu is is a
 philosophy that's expressed physically and thatit's
 the kind of development of the in mental capacity and physical capacity workingin
 unison to uh move efficiently andalmost flowingly unresistantly um
 with with a given situation with a with or physically resisting opponentum learning how to generate force on
 your own and how to steal force from the floor how to steal force from the otherperson and move in concert with it as
 opposed to clash against which if you watchtwo untrained people fight it's almost
 entirely a clash it's a runaway and clash or run away and clashum if you watch jiu jitsu done well
 it's it looks like water moving around a solid structureand and i think that that is expressed
 physically and i think that all of the thingsthat anyone have really been able to do
 very very well in jiu jitsu end up kind of exemplifying that but i thinkthat's true of martial arts in general
 i think that a lot of times like the clashing that we see going onum and working well is just the fact
 that you know you get very very physically powerful peopleevery now and then they're able to get
 away with this but i don't think that that's and that's that's fantasticbecause ultimately it's a results-driven
 thing but i think that the essence of the martialarts is learning how to make more out of
 less and how to move with and be yielding almost like real lifeaikido


0:46:53
Speaker 1 :and uh so you think of martial arts uh
 jiu jitsu as uh like wateror flowing so aikido so moving around
 the the force as opposed to sort of maybe the wrestling mindset isfinding a leverage where you can apply
 an exceptional amount of force so like it's like maximizing theapplication of force i guess maybe


0:47:18
Speaker 0 :that's a better way to i'd like to marry
 the two ideas you know because i think you flow until the point at whichyou are the greater force at which point
 in time you can apply but uh if you look at the best wrestlersand when i say best i don't necessarily
 mean most successful although of course most successful are always very verygood
 um throughout the course of history in boxing inwrestling in judo they're magical
 they they disappear and reappear it's like fighting a ghost that thatis like incorporeal when you want to
 find it but then when you don't want to find itwhen you don't want to find it it finds
 you and i i think that we see that in the like the bouvie source citativesof wrestling
 um and you know i guess you could look at uh floyd mayweather or willie pepor you know pernell whitaker in boxing
 um as brilliant examples of disappearing and reappearing and whenyou're strong it's almost like gorilla
 warfare when you're strong i'm nowhere to befound when you're weak you can't get rid
 of me and i think that's what we're looking

0:48:17
Speaker 1 :for yeah the tear brothers are
 incredible at that they just they they look like uh skinny starbucksbaristas
 and uh they just manhandle everybody like effort effortlessly theylook like they just kind of woke up
 rolled out of bed go fighting for like thethe gold medal at the olympics and just
 effortlessly throw uh like there's a match against you iguess yo romero
 yeah so like you you know if you look at like who is the guywho's like intimidating in this case uh
 and the terrifying looking it's uh it's joe romero just likea physical specimen and obviously like a
 super accomplished wrestler i think this is for the gold medal yeahin 2008
 2000 yeah sydney and then there this is

0:49:04
Speaker 0 :the year you all took silver


0:49:07
Speaker 1 :and what you like just to just show you
 like there's a inside trip effortless gucci andhe does it again
 you know it's a really creative kind of wrestling where

0:49:23
Speaker 0 :

0:49:24
Speaker 1 :it's organic yeah you're throwing all
 these kinds of things this is a mix of judo a mix oflike weird kind of moves it's not like
 as funky as uh ben askren it's it's just like legitimate basic

0:49:38
Speaker 0 :well it's not funky for funky's sake and
 i'm not poking right then asking to imply that that's what he's doing butit's like it's it's funny it's like a
 lot of times it's almost like a musashi talked a lot about that you know thatthe only goal of combat is
 to win is the the outcome is it's outcome driven versus like flourishingyou know cool looking movements it's
 like unless that had a utilitarian purpose like what are you wasting yourtime with that
 both in the fight and also you know in practicebut but as you mentioned it's almost
 like it looks like judo it looks like wrestling it looks like jiu jitsu it'salmost like i guess
 reminds me all of the martial arts is again deeply tribal as well ii want to learn lex friedman martial
 arts and then i want to learn another you know i guess transcendentperson's martial arts and it just
 happened to be the set of movements that you tended to do most of the timethanks to your body type and your
 opposition and whatnot but then i try to codifythat and force those to work as opposed
 to going i want to understand how the body works in concert and in incongress with something else and other
 forces and move appropriately and that's whyit's like it always struck me that the
 psyche brothers are great examples of just moving like water but they to usebruce lee which is a little trite but
 again it's brilliant it's like water can flow or what it can crash andthey would crash when they needed to
 crash and they would flow when they needed to flow but they would flow forthe purpose of dissipating and then
 crash when they would win and at the right moment then go back toflowing the second that the other person
 found them and it's just it's beautiful to watch it's artistic and ithink that great expression of anything
 physical is ultimately studied as a science but expressed as an art and ithink that that's something that gets
 lost in jiu jitsu a lot of times when it getsa little bit a little nerdy like do this
 hand to your hand here like it's like the more details i have the betterwhen in reality that's just not not in
 my experience how it's done

0:51:17
Speaker 1 :might be a fun exercise of saying like
 what are the main positions and submissions in the art of jiu jitsuyou don't have to be complete that's a
 ridiculously i apologize for putting you on the spot like this butit might be a nice exercise to think


0:51:35
Speaker 0 :through it sure i mean i would just say
 that they're they're you have your arms bend invarious ways you have
 key lock americana straight arm locks kimura omoplata omoplata is achemorecognizable plot that's just
 executed emissions

0:51:45
Speaker 1 :like submissions breaking off your arm
 in all kinds of ways but ultimately

0:51:49
Speaker 0 :the question is let's say you were a
 terminator like a robot that i which of course you aregoing on it's like all right so we're
 being completely literal but uh and i and i couldn't harm youwith any of these things would i still
 use these positions the answer is yes they they create leverage they createcontrol they create
 shapes that i can affect and that can affect me and they can be affectedthrough other forces
 and other objects or structures like the ground or the wall i really enjoy mixedmartial arts because
 there's another component rather than just me and you and the floor there's meyou the floor and the wall and it's
 another player in the game that doesn't existuh in a grappling context with an uh in
 a non-enclosed you know i guess area of combat but umyou can strangle me or choke me um what
 do you call it uh without my arms being involved or youcan use one of my shoulders
 to pin one side of my one carotid artery off and you can enclose the otheryou can turn my knee in the exact same
 ways that you can turn my arm straight this way and that way you canadd a rotation to that or it can be
 directly linear against the joint so i guess what i would say is the morethat i've been able to understand
 jiu jitsu the more that i've been it's given me a look into how welearn language where rather than
 learning five bazillion adjectives i go i understand what an adjective is and ofcourse we are all read into
 some degree of vocabulary i understand what an adverb doesand i understand what an adverb is i
 know what a noun is i know what the component parts of a sentenceare i know what you know i guess a
 clause a contraction any of these things and it allows you to be um interestingand artistic
 with your language to the extent that you can but i can't like i can speak adegree of spanish but i'm not even
 slightly artistic in spanish i would be something i speak like like a child witha head injury
 and anyway um your basic understanding

0:53:35
Speaker 1 :of
 the english language allows you to then be a student of spanish

0:53:40
Speaker 0 :100 but i'm limited by my experience i'm
 limited by my understanding of techniques and i'mlimited unders by my understanding
 almost like let's say techniques are like these are like vocabularyum so even if i kind of sort of grasp
 the sentence structure and the thought process and the thoughtpatterns of of spanish which it's
 interesting because just even though the orientation and the organization ofa language and i've thought about this a
 great deal um you know the way that i perceive theworld is affected deeply by the language
 that i learned you know the again if i learned i haveno idea the chinese language structures
 but i can only imagine that it would be that it would affect it's like adifferent lens we're looking at the same
 thing but i have i have a different set of sunglasses on than you doum and uh that's that's very very
 interesting i'll use the quran as an exampleyou know apparently it's unbelievably
 poetic in in arabic still neat and was interesting readingin english but
 i'm told by people that i trust that it just one doesn't bear resemblance to theother and i think that's a very
 interesting thing that you may be able to say the same thing but in in a morein i guess in a different way in a more
 artistic way that that may not translate on a one-for-one kindof fidelity but um
 the more that we're able to understand about how the body works the moreexamples of the body working this way
 the body working that way the body working that waythe more that i'm able to eventually
 become an artist but it has to be studied as a science first and it doesstart with technique collection
 vocabulary collection the same way we learnin school you remember how to say
 quickly 17 different ways and let's say i speakspanish
 i'm only i only know three so you might usequickly you might use an adjective like
 quickly in spanish but use one of the many many options to describe that thati don't understand now i sit there and
 go like wait what i can't be artistic i can't beas organic with the language as i'd like
 so i believe that jiu jitsu a lot of times starts withthe acquisition of a lot of hey do this
 this this drill this technique here's an american americana to an arm lock armlocked to a triangle
 um but the problem with that is oftentimes we get stuck in that phaseand i people eventually become move
 collectors or sequence collectors and i notice this when i'm trying to dodvds or i guess like an instructional
 series now or even teaching in class i don't believe in that form of learninganymore um not that it's not valuable
 but i don't believe i don't understand jujitsu on that levelanymore so what i'm trying to do is get
 across the basic ideas to people and say heyyou need to fill in the gaps with going
 to class all the time you need to go hey learn this move learn that techniquelearn that technique because otherwise
 i'm basically just throwing at you like 75 different words that you coulduse but that hasn't really taught you
 how to how to speak a language whereas if you give methe language structure
 you can fill in these pieces on your own and then eventually speak organicallyin lex form which will be ultimately
 unique to you because otherwise you just end up beinga weird facsimile of whatever it is that
 i'm doing for mostly the worst i'd say but uh yeah

0:56:29
Speaker 1 :that's what people i mean people comment
 like is this especially people haven't listened to me beforeuh is this guy drunk or high does he
 does mit really allow slow people to uh

0:56:43
Speaker 0 :to be like


0:56:45
Speaker 1 :like what's what's wrong with him is he
 getting sleep are you okay and does he need help so that that'ssimilar with my jiu jitsu it's like this
 is this guy is this guy really whatever rank i was throughouti remember just like is this guy really
 this rank i just have a very kind of certain wayof sitting and being slow and
 lazy looking that that was ultimately the language that i had to discover andit was uh it was yeah it was a very
 liberating moment i think ofprobably a few years of getting my ass
 kicked especially with open guard and butterflyto where you really allow yourself to
 take in the entirety of the language and realize that umthat i'm not i'm different i'm a unique
 i'm i'm unique and like i have a very uh i have a language i have a set oftechniques a way i
 move my body that needs that i'm the one to discoverlike it's you can only you can learn
 specific techniques and so on but you really have tounderstand your own body that's the
 beautiful thing about jiu jitsu like you saidis like the the connection about your
 philosophy your view of the world with the physical and like connectingthose two things
 how you perceive the world how you interpretideas of the world about exhaustion
 about force about effortlessness like what it reallymeans to relax
 all these kinds of loose concepts and then actuallyteach your body to like do those things
 and like you know and be able to apply force and spurts to be able to relax insports and like figure all that stuff
 out for my for your my individual body butit's


0:58:26
Speaker 0 :as you mentioned that's i couldn't agree
 with you more it's a discovery process and no one can cheat that processwhich is at the same time it's almost
 like imagine i want to start writing books in second grade unlessmaybe i'm like staggeringly brilliant i
 wish i could only conceptualize someone being able to do that butmaybe a mozart of the english language
 where you're out there doing it but for most of us we don't have enoughknowledge enough information enough
 experience to be able to be to express ourselves so we have tobasically
 input repeat um which is important but it's the process as you say of goingthrough that of getting your ass kicked
 just like well that didn't work well that didn't work that felt right but idon't know nobody else does that i guess
 i don't believe in that versus eventually going i don't knowi'll just try going my own way and see
 what happens and now i'll get yelled at and people won't like me and if it worksthey'll say i got lucky and if it
 doesn't work they'll say i was dumb but uh which maybe all is right butbasically uh
 you know going through that iterative process that allows you to eventuallyfind your self-expression and find your
 voice so that you you fight the same way that you speakthe same way that you write the same way
 that you think in a way that that is uniquely you that will alsoultimately allow you
 to understand other people being uniquely them because even if you canonly conceptualize and i think about
 this a lot for society stuff where i go well this ishow i feel about this but
 am i objectively right maybe about a couple things but that's a small boxthat i have to be very very careful
 about what i think is objective and versus what's not and i have to beopen to the possibility that all the
 things that i think are objectively correct may or may not beand that should allow me to have some
 degree of compassion or consideration for other people both in their martialarts journey and in their
 in their journey you know as people as human beings because i understandthat they're on a it's a we're all on a
 path right it's all a again an iterative process of eventualself-expression but i think that's one
 of the things that we see having trouble when we see tribalismwhich i mean
 raises an expression of that political affiliation expression of thatall of these things that can go in
 really uncomfortable directions people are looking forhey where do i plant my feet over here
 where's where's the thing that i know is right and that we can all agree on thefollowing
 and i think that we see that in martial arts we're like oh i do this style whydo that style i do that stuff which is
 like hey man we're all just pushing forward in a certaindirection you're trying to do our best
 and i understand why you feel the way you do i may have felt like that at onepoint too
 but uh you know what i'm just trying to learn and understandversus i've already acquired enough
 knowledge let me cross my arms and start to to look who's up around hereyeah and and i think that uh
 that that's an it's an interesting trap that i think is very human trapped tofall into but it definitely happens
 early on it's something it's a joke in the jiu jitsu world right like how theblue belt that knows everything well
 initially it's like what i know nothing and iat least think i know nothing then i'd
 learn a little bit and i think it's a lot bitand then you know the more you learn the
 more you go like i don't even know what i'm doing

1:01:11
Speaker 1 :yeah that's exactly right we kind of
 talked about it a little bit but uh once again a lot of people thatlisten to this
 have never been on the mat have never tried jiu jitsu but are really curiousabout it
 everybody at all positions like i think elon musk's kids are not doing jiu jitsuandrew yang is like they're all you know
 the world is curious it's a it's a nice it seems to bea nice methodology by which to humble
 your ego which to grow intellectually and physically sopeople are curious about it so the
 natural question is if they're curious about ithow would you recommend they get started
 maybe like what do you recommend the first day weekmonth
 year first couple years look like like how do you ease into itand make sure that it's a positive
 experience and you progress in the most optimal andpositive way


1:02:03
Speaker 0 :the first thing you can do is simply ask
 yourself why why you want to be involved you know iremember the first day that i walked
 into ronan athletics in new york city to train under umgodfather my son now christian montes
 and i didn't know what i was getting myself into iplayed baseball through high school and
 i wanted i was at manhattan college in the bronx and i wanted to go andlearn martial arts because
 it was always something that was interesting to me but it was neversomething that that was
 i that i knew was accessible and it definitely wasn't really around innorthern virginia where i grew up
 whereas then you stick yourself in in manhattan and there's stuff everywhereso anyway i guess i didn't know what to
 expect um i didn't know if i was going to get beat up if peoplewere going to be nice if people were not
 going to be nice um but what i began with was i thinkexpectation management
 and i think that that's something that uh i wouldthat'll be the first thing that i would
 start is almost imagining what is it that i'm getting myself intobecause i love the martial arts with
 with the martial arts has given me everything in life and i'm sothankful i wouldn't be sitting here um
 without without that that experience thatjourney of the people that i've met the
 place that i got i could never ever have ever imagined umand i'm just unbelievably thankful for
 that but i think that the thing that um that helped memost of all was starting with you know
 my mom said something to me one time and she said you know there'stwo types of people in various
 situations there's why and there's why notand you know it's understandable to have
 questions concerns things like that um but maybe sometimes a little biteasier when you're when you're younger
 to just trust people or just say oh well you know umbut uh we go hey you want to climb that
 rock i'm like yeah why not let's go hey you want to jump in that river yeahwhy not sure versus if i have to
 reason my way into everything i have to be talked into everythinga lot of times i'll talk myself out of
 it and i think that a lot of times this is the thinker's diseaseyou want to figure out what's going to
 happen and what you should expect to have happenbefore you get involved versus going
 using the old bruce lee saying again it's like no amount of thinking ortraining on the on the side of the river
 will teach you how to swim you have to jump in and there are risksassociated with that
 and so uh i guess uh psychological are usually the biggest ones that's thebiggest hurdle and physical
 but the biggest thing that i guess i would suggest to anyone to say why doyou want to do this you're like well i
 want to challenge myself i want to learn i would like to learn to fight i wantedto learn to fight so that i could
 protect myself and if and if anything else other people if only within armsreach
 um i perceived that if i had some small degree of powerum i generally wouldn't use it which is
 why i was like i'll give it a try i'll try to be reasonable and hopefully if imake a mistake i'll apologize to people
 but basically uh i said yeah i'd like to have that andi wanna i know this is gonna be
 challenging and we'll see what happens and that means that getting beat up andi didn't get like hurt but getting
 roughed up and getting my arm bent this way or that way getting chokedi was like well this is all supposed to
 happen that's no big deal it would be like going and joining thearmy during peace time
 and then going oh i'm just doing this for a college education you're like okaythat's cool man
 and then all of a sudden war breaks out and they want to send me somewhere andi'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa i didn't
 sign up for that gig actu actually you did whether yourealized it or not you may not have
 thought that you did but you did so getting your mind rightand
 and just going what are my expectations this activity what is it that i'mlooking to do and of course
 you know you're you're going into a gym you're going into a place that you don'tknow people you probably don't know
 people and you don't know the coach and even if you do want to hey how you doingshake your hand type of level
 you know 95 percent of my students don't know me not really you know i'll try tobe polite and not annoy them too much
 but they don't know me and i don't know themum i understand if they don't trust me i
 wouldn't trust trust me either if i were them butat the same time
 someone has to take that leap and one of the things that i've noticed um as amartial arts instructor that's the
 biggest struggle uh with dealing with adults which is whya lot of people like to teach kids is
 because kids don't ask don't argue now that also means there'sthere's all sorts of pitfalls with that
 sort of thing and that can be an issue but you know i guess a lot of timespeople get to a point in their life you
 know in their 20s early 30s where now i'm i'm amanager now i know what i'm doing
 no one talks to me like that yeah versus like hey man you go join boot camp idon't care if you are elon musk they're
 gonna tell you to shut up and do push-ups yeah and that'swhat's great about it yeah um so you are
 taking a leap of faith into a world that you're gonna be a tinyfish and you gotta hope that the people
 um who are who are guiding you in that in that journey are gonna havei can't say even say your best interests
 at heart because they don't even know you but they'll they'll try to do noharm and they'll try to help you in the
 way that they would understand and i guess that's for instance that'swhat i would try to do with anyone
 that that comes into my gym i would try to help them in the way that iunderstand
 they need as best i can in as safe and reasonable a way as possiblebut sometimes in a way that's going to
 make them uncomfortable particularly if physical combatand and it's not something they've done
 before if a lot of people go in without evenhaving played you know contact sports
 and so that can be a big jump and you have to understand if if that'swhere you're starting from no worries
 but you're going to have to kind of work your way to it and it's going to beuncomfortable and
 and that's okay it's part of the process and you're gonna have some bumps andbruises
 and you're not gonna want to roll with that guy in the corner because that thatperson's rough and they beat you up and
 they're like okay but is this a big hurt or is it a littlehurt if it's a big hurt
 okay if it's a little hurt you need to use you justdrop a little bit yeah it's such an


1:07:26
Speaker 1 :interesting balance because
 to find i think one of the most important thingsas in anything i think in life is the
 selection of the people or that you put around youi mean that's true with the like getting
 married that's true with uh like if you go to if people ask melike graduate students
 like your phd advisor can um can be the difference it's everythingit's like you spend five years with
 somebody they're going to basically definethe more impact on you than anybody you
 marry anybody you hang out with it's a huge impact and the same with thethe coach selection which is
 like the school selection is it's going to be really important aboutin terms of like who you select will uh
 define how happy like the trajectory of your growth and how happy you are withthe entirety of the experience and yet
 like the the flip side of that is especially if you have an ego especiallyif you are the manager then you need to
 let go of some stuff you're gonna feel like with thegood with the best kind of coach
 that's that's what you need right but there's a nice there's a weird balancethere to find
 like i i mean like and everybody needs a different thing like i'm much moreuh i enjoy being sort of like
 it sounds weird but like i am you know from the wrestling backgroundi enjoy feeling like crap in the sense
 like the coach like getting beat up i don't actuallyenjoy it
 it's not like some masochistic thing or

1:09:03
Speaker 0 :whatever


1:09:05
Speaker 1 :it's the growth like i like the anxiety
 i like uh feeling uh like like when i go homelike
 emotionally physically it's

1:09:17
Speaker 0 :like it's growth it's a sign of growth
 right like if you're not having to feel those thingsyou're probably in your comfort zone
 which is fine but that's not your growth zone

1:09:24
Speaker 1 :right and everybody has a different
 threshold for that and you i mean the thebeautiful thing about jiu jitsu is like
 it's also has like a yoga feel to it like you're learning about your bodyso depending on the gym and depending on
 in fact the coaches the people around you withinthe gym you can select little groups too
 kind of like the people with who you roll like if you're a smaller personit doesn't mean you have to go against
 big people you can go against the people who likesmoke a lot of weed and they're chill or
 you can go against like that crazy ripped blue belt competitor who's likeout to destroy everybody
 and depending on like what your mindset is you can kind of select thatit's just such a fascinating journey uh
 of like basically self-discovery i

1:10:09
Speaker 0 :couldn't agree with you more it's i mean
 what you need may change over time right maybe whatyou needed what you need today could
 change six months from now or a year from now and that's something that iexperience i'll use my uh first coach
 christian again as a great example of someone who i reallylook up to and respect and someone who
 helped me a lot like at a time when i really needed some guidance and i neededto learn
 martial arts but get into i the hens of gracie's gym was right down the streetfrom where christian was teaching
 and christian was a blue belt at the time it was uh he was teaching at aplace called fight house which was this
 awesome like you know like 90s early 2000syou know warehouse area uh down on
 fashion avenue in uh in manhattan off of like between seventhand eighth and uh it was like
 like two basketball courts wide but like there was the [ __ ] guys over here therewas the kali guys over there there was a
 wing chun over there with jits in the cornerand hens was one of the most famous
 academies in the world at that time still isand i just didn't know what enzo gracie
 was and i mean it's a great gym and it's a fantasticplace for people to train but i think
 what was right for me at the time was to i stumbled into a you know like atwo-person elevator
 up and found a place where six people trained at that timeand i had someone that that i could that
 could give me some like in addition to martial arts advicelike personal guidance
 and that made it that made a big difference and then one initially wewould have like competitions or like
 intra intra you know gym competitions with the[ __ ] guys we would comp
 we would roll with them and like again it was great because they were just abunch of like like russian dudes from
 like brighton beach and they would come downand then we would all fight and then
 everyone would train and we'd all drink tea and then go homeand uh anyway uh what was uh
 it was super super tough and they were like again just a tough group of peopleit was great
 and then i remember when i decided after like four or five months i'm like man ireally want to try to take this
 seriously and i told christian about that and he's like well hey i think youneed to do the following and it was
 you know like hey here's there was a guy named jeff ruth who was uhabout at the time which was a much
 bigger deal than it is now but it was 10-0 as an mma fighter a lot of amateurbody spirits super tough dude
 and jeff was was the best person at that time that i'd ever trained with and ijust got squashed christians beat me up
 too but like jeff would just absolutely kick the crapout of me and i was like this is
 awesome and this was back when i was at home i went home for the summer for thatand chris is like hey i think you should
 stay because i told him that's what i wasthinking and this was a coach that
 you know when it's like when initially was exactly what i needed and then he'slike well hey that's not what i'm doing
 here maybe they're going to be able to help you onto a path that's that's kind of
 commensurate with what your goals are at the momentand then you know that was a niche that
 was an interesting thing and i really got i feel that i was fortunate to startum at a place where my coach was able to
 transition roles and and and do so comfortably and ithink that that also was probably a
 factor of the fact that you know where he'd done some of histraining prior like there have been
 issues with with the coach there we're like notsupporting not having the support
 you know feeling like hey like i'm gonna hold on to my students i'm gonna hold onto my best guy or my best girl even if i
 can't take them where they need to go um sothat was an interesting thing and just
 recognizing also though that the people like the same way you're anindividual going into a gym and you
 don't know what you're getting into your coach is a person too and he or sheyou know they may have been doing this
 activity longer than you but they're not they're not some weird little you knowall-knowing god they don't know anything
 but they're gonna they may say something that pisses youoff they may they may yell at you they
 may help you they may inadvertently cause you some sort of youknow some sort of issue
 and just being able to recognize that even though i say this to people andi've said this to people in my gym i'm
 like you know we're in the service industryman but i'm not at your service like
 don't get it twisted like i will absolutely do my best to help peoplei'm there to do my best as a martial
 arts coach but i'm here to do my best as amartial arts coach and i'll do my best
 and periodically i make mistakes and i ownan apology or two and i'll try to give
 them out when i can but uh we're not mcdonald's it's not ohyou gave me 100 bucks so you do whatever
 you want in here this is my house this is my gym this is my dojo this is thisis the martial arts this is not a
 basketball team yeah there's something

1:14:01
Speaker 1 :beautiful about
 martial arts like exactly as you said as the coachlike in wrestling and at least
 collegiate like high level wrestling it's like there's a dictatorship aspectto a coach that is very important to
 have like this this ridiculous sometimesnature of like master and so on
 and bowing all these traditions there's something it seems ridiculous from theoutside perhaps but there's something
 really powerful to that because that process of you said why notof letting go of the leap of faith
 requires you to believe that the coach has your bestinterest in mind and just give yourself
 over to their ideas of howhow you should grow and that's an
 interesting thing i mean i've never been able toreally see coaches i've had as
 human they're always you always it's like a father figure orlike this you always put them in this
 position of power and i think that's i think at least for me it's been a veryit's been a very useful way to see the
 coach because it allows you to not think and let go and really allowyourself to grow
 and emotionally deal with all the

1:15:14
Speaker 0 :beatings they'll push you where
 past oftentimes where you would have stopped yourself right which is greatand hopefully they know
 they if they're paying attention and they're they're still a person they canmake mistakes but they'll push you
 further than you would have gone but not so far that it's notfacilitative right right that's
 something that i can say like ferraza hobby um the head coachat tristar my head coach for mma kenny
 florian one of the head coaches for mma have both been phenomenal influencespaul schreiner who's the uh
 one of the assistants at marcelo garcia's academy um coached me in jiujitsu for a long time brilliant
 instructor they've all been able to do that and ithink what's interesting about all of
 those guys they're very sharp but they they're very intuitive as well and ithink that for us actually
 uh you know told me about something that john wooden said john wooden thelegendary ucla basketball coach just a
 simple philosophical idea just he said some people's life is abowl of
 it needs some whipped cream in it some people's life is a bowl of whipped creamneeds a little bit of in it just to
 balance it out and it's an interesting thing coaching everyone the same waydoesn't work you know that's i think the
 difference between a coach and an instructor and a lot of times peoplethink they want to coach but they really
 want an instructor i'm like hey lex tell me what to do not how to doit and then other times people think
 they want you know an instructor and they really want to coachi'm like man this guy's just giving me
 information a coach is so much more than an instructor and that's a huge leapand that's something that i think that
 people need to understand when they're going into martial arts and i understandi can totally grasp why they don't
 because how how would they know but uh i think about this a lot like me givingyou 150 dollars for a month which is not
 nothing that's for sure that does not that pays for instructorreally coach is a relationship that gets
 developed because can you imagine like just the amount ofemotional investment and and time
 thinking away from from like oh alex isn't here anymore what can i do to helphim what does he need
 like that's that's serious and that's the difference between that'sthat's oftentimes the difference that at
 getting getting over the hump in various situationsso it's a it's an interesting you know
 bargain that's being made like commitment by theby the instructor who becomes a coach
 commitment by the student you know like there's a financialtransaction there's a lot of things
 going on there but i feel very fortunate to have hadnot just instructors in my time but
 coaches and that means sometimes we butted headsand sometimes i look back and i think i
 was right and other times looked back on my own no they were definitely rightbut there was always the trust um with
 the exception of one time that i feel that trust was greatly betrayedum that
 rightly or wrongly whether mistakes mistakes will be made buteveryone is attempting to do do the
 right thing under no circumstances would i intentionallydo anything malicious you know versus
 hey i might have done i'm going to burn your house down but you can be darn sureit wasn't on purpose
 and i think that as long as there's that mutual understanding and mutual beliefof goodwill
 which again doesn't just magic up out of nowhere i understandi think that that's when then great
 things can happen and i look at all the athletes that i knowyou know the guys and girls that i've
 watched become fantastic in various placesalmost invariably it never happened
 alone yeah yeah

1:18:05
Speaker 1 :i'm really torn about that like um maybe
 you can help have you seen the movie whiplash so it'suh
 i would say from an outsider's perspective people should watch it's ai guess jazz band it's a movie about a
 drummer and the instructor and he it's a basicallyi would say from the outsider's
 perspective it's a toxic relationship but he's really the coach whatever wecall him
 pushes the the musician the drama to his limits like to wherehe just feels like um emotionally
 it's a it looks like a toxic relationship but it's one thatultimately is very
 productive for the improvement of the musiciani have the same like in my own
 experience i had um i got a chance to train a couple placesregularly and so one of my coaches
 uh who is a great human being a lot of people love himbut when i was a blue belt he was
 pushing me a lot for competition and every time i stepped on the mat iwas uh
 anxious and almost afraid of training because of like the places i'm gonnahave to go
 and then the i can't i don't know what's good or bad becausei think
 i've become a better person because of that experience like i needed thatand on the flip side like the place i
 got my black belt from balance studios is iremember also
 blue belt uh the coach sitting down and i was going to competition and hesaw something in me
 where he said um you know like good luck but win or losewe always love you like i i
 re i remember that because i really needed that at that time like i wasputting so much pressure on myself
 like i'm not an actual professional competitoryou know i just competed like i'm a pg
 student like but like it was clearly having apsychological effect on me
 and that's what a great coach does it's likeyou know it's like life is more
 important than jiu-jitsu sense that's right it's bigger so theyfind
 you use jiu-jitsu when you need it to grow as a personand when it overwhelms you you
 you have to pull that person out like look at the bigger picture always lookat the bigger picture
 it's fascinating and i don't know what to make of it i don't think i would haveit any other way is
 both the anxiety and the and the love

1:20:46
Speaker 0 :yeah i think that i couldn't that's a
 really interesting thing that you're describing thati i guess it kind of brings me back to a
 lot of the other things we've been discussing isjust almost like the the reciprocal
 nature of everything where no pressure that's great everyone'shappy all the time it's either i mean
 let's uh use an example of sci-fi movies let's say the matrix which of coursethe first one was amazing and then each
 subsequent movie made the series worse but um but basically i'm working on anew one by the way yeah i've heard
 we'll see i was hoping for the best but um but basically uh you know it's likehey we started
 our first initial world agent smith says to neo he's like our first worldwas a utopia where everyone was happy
 and nothing ever went wrong it's like your primitivecerebrum rejected it and i think that
 there's obviously i mean what do i think but iguess well i'm here so i might as well
 say what i think um i guess uh you knowgreat things are fantastic a kind
 gentle place is fantastic and this is again why i love dune because i thinkdoon does such a great job of expressing
 frank herbert does such a great job of expressing again the reciprocal natureof these ideas
 you know look at uh look at sparta for instance or at least what i understandsparta from the reading and also
 watching 300. um you know and reading wikipedia andreading the wikipedia article about the
 movie not the place um but uh it's umthat's a hard brutal place and
 that was their benefit to that like absolutely was there drawback to thatabsolutely is it sustainable i should i
 would think probably not um i mean granted it hasn't sustainedbut i mean that type of a
 of a thing it burns too hot almost and it uhit destroys the host at a certain point
 and you know i guess that that type of unforgiving naturebut entirely entirely permissive has its
 own issues and i guess coming back to yourwhat your description of like describing
 a toxic relationship is a very dangerous and tricky thing because it'salmost like uh it's like bird's-eye view
 me it's what you know you see let's say ahusband and a wife arguing and you're
 like all right well sort of somebody hitting somebody i needto keep myself out of this because i
 have no idea what i'm seeing something but i don'tknow what's going on or why specifically
 and again short of it going to a place that's that just out out of boundsi don't know who's right here i don't
 know who's wrong and i don't know what phase of this things they're in so iguess


1:23:08
Speaker 1 :long term what's good for yeah both


1:23:11
Speaker 0 :people
 right it's dangerous for so if i want to put my finger on the scale i canunderstand the desire to do i'm like hey
 guys let's break it up yeah but and that may be the right thingat the time but at the same time i'm not
 sure so i think back to all of the times thatyou know that like you mentioned your
 coach pushing you when very very hard and then other timesgoing like hey let's put in perspective
 here i think that's an interesting thing forhigh performance and i think that we're
 seeing that again societally you know now or atleast maybe that's it just pops up on my
 internet feed periodically um but coaches shouldn't be allowed todo this or yell at this person to yell
 at that person like well have you ever been go to a boxing gymit's not a commercial entity not really
 a real boxing not la boxing not a ufc gymlike a real place you're going to see
 what things are like when it's entirely performance-based go to wrestling roomat a high level
 you know again there's there's left and right limits and there are such thingsobviously as abuse of course but and
 that should never be tolerated um but it's not a commercial entityi don't need to be sweet to you if
 you're if you're screwing up if you're dropping the ball and in factrecognizing that i'm not
 doing you a favor or the team a favor by bybeing permissive of that type of
 behavior i think is important everything in its context and at its timeis important and i guess i can think
 again at the times that i've been put put or had put on me like a great dealof pressure
 to do x y as a year to succeed um or to push for success andi can't look back fondly enough on those
 times they were tough at the time but withoutthat i'm not sitting here without that
 i don't go from growing up in a very nice family in the suburbs to fightingat the highest level in jiu jitsu
 nogi and now in mixed martial arts starting a career at age 27.you know i don't it just doesn't happen
 because people generally speaking from thatbackground don't get pushed hard enough
 physically to be able to make that transitionand that has benefits and it has
 drawbacks you know when you stare into the abyss it stares back and i thinkthat that's an important thing to
 understand you know you stare long enough you youcan become something that you don't
 that you would be sorry that you did you don't look enough and you don't haveperspective either
 you know and i i think that that's an interesting thing i can speak to someonewho's relative to being someone who's
 relatively articulate and reasonably i try to be reasonablebut you know i'll say inspiring if
 people get crazy with me they get a warningand then i'm gonna crack them and what
 did they expect oh they hear the guy on an interview but who did theythink they were meeting because there's
 also the guy in the ring

1:25:42
Speaker 1 :and there's layers there too i remember
 training with you it's kind of funny there's like there'swell you didn't know who i was i mean
 you still like

1:25:53
Speaker 0 :i have a really good strength a lot by
 the way that

1:25:56
Speaker 1 :so i don't remember what rank i was but
 it might have been purple or something like that and i didsome like i you had this look on your
 face which i've often seen in black belts it's like here he goesagain


1:26:12
Speaker 0 :

1:26:14
Speaker 1 :like here here's him trying this thing
 and then when i kind of annoyed you a little bit with itnow i get that it was a good like i you
 know i did something somewhat effective like somelike maybe a little bit off balance yeah
 there's i just peeled off a little layer of ryanhall to where i was like okay let me
 let me like there there's like layers underneath thecovers are like somewhere in there like
 so it was like okay this like new guy rolls in here hethinks he can
 do this stupid thing and then and then you start to beat the hell out of mebut the the point is there's layers here
 from the guy who was being interviewed now to likegenghis khan


1:26:54
Speaker 0 :but it's but it's all in the same body
 right but it's like all of us are like that right in various differentdirections and recognizing that's okay
 it's just there are consequences to all every choice that we make as aconsequence sometimes
 there's like objectively wrong or objectively right but at least in mymind that's a pretty small box
 everything else is just there's a consequence of that do you like thatconsequence do you not
 and who do i want to become what do i want to try tohone myself or anyone else into and also
 like but this is something i've screwed up asa coach plenty of times you know like if
 someone says if you're if like i come to like lex ireally really want to take
 you know research very seriously like okay i believe you nowi haven't shown you that but i believe
 you're like okay and now me not showing up to research or tostudy or not being up until three in the
 morning thinking about this is no longer acceptablethere was a time like five seconds
 before me making that statement that if i went to bed without reading the bookthat i needed to read
 no worries but the second that i made that statement youryour expectations for me change and
 maybe it's something that's something that i've screwed up a whole bunch oftimes in my
 um as a teacher because it's an interesting thing obviously you knowbeing a like running a martial arts
 school as you're principally an athlete um issometimes i don't pay enough attention
 to what people are doing i just go oh okay you say xyz i'm like roger that ibelieve you're cool
 i will now put you in category x and whether rightly or wrongly like maybethis person didn't understand what they
 were asking for or i didn't express this or the other and it justit caused cross wires and then most
 times you hash it out you have a discussion you figure out get to thebottom of what people are trying to do
 or what they want but uh if i was paying more attention ithink i could have been a lot more
 effective or if i had more experience and sometimes maybe i'm not sharp enoughor i don't person i'm not perceptive
 enough to be able to to see what's going on and maybe withyears more down the line i'll be able to
 have a sharper perception but uh i think that's another one of those interestingthings that
 some that sometimes i would caution or not caution but just to inform aprospective martial arts student
 depending upon where you're going um you know this youboth you and also your coach or other
 people in the room they wear many hats and sometimes there's a i had the wronghat on you were talking to me
 as lex the guy i didn't realize you were talking to me i thought she would tellme his elects the guy i didn't realize
 she talked me as lex the martial artist i'm like oh crapi was talking to the wrong person so
 it's almost like if you had a like i run my gym withmy wife she's a black belt so she's my
 wife she's my peers as a martial artist uhon in jiu jitsu he's here by the way in


1:29:11
Speaker 1 :judging so exactly


1:29:13
Speaker 0 :all right well all right so but a fellow
 black belt and i guess like another he doesn't have a microphone so you can't

1:29:18
Speaker 1 :hear all the trash he's talking exactly


1:29:20
Speaker 0 :but it can be tough and that's something
 we've had to work through a lot and it's like looking back and it's like nowbeing where i'm at now and it's easy me
 to say that because she's in the room andi don't want to stab me just continue to
 slowly poison me over time yeah um which frankly i understand umyou know it's it's the sort of thing
 that is now way more effective than anythingelse i could really
 reasonably expect to have um but there were times when when both of usyou know were justifiably annoyed at the
 other because of crossed wires and sometimes you knowyou just have to scream in anywhere mr
 standing anyway but again like i've i coached some of myfriends i've coached i've coached
 my friend who i've known since i was four years old you know sometimes idon't go hey buddy how you doing
 someone's like what the are you doing put yourhand over there how many times we talked
 about this and then you walk away and you can see him look at you crookedand you're like oh crap oh yeah he
 thought i was talking to his friend yeah well all right we need to talk thisone out hashing out and not
 he's wrong how could he possibly think that way like oh no i totally understandthat but if i was 22
 like doesn't he know i'm a purple belt some nonsense like that and it's and itdoesn't come from a bad
 place but it's just i guess that comes back to society to anything people onlyhave the perspective that they have and
 the awareness that we have and so again going back and going heyguys grace like i don't expect it's not
 fair for me to go i for ufc why doesn't this guy who came in asan attorney understand how hardcore this
 needs to be and like how could he yeah and at the same time though if ifi'm using the language of
 someone that is interested in at least performance from a martial artsperspective
 i understand how that could be off-putting let's say for instancesomeone that's
 comple like all of that would be out of bounds in their normal workplace but ifthey think of the gym as my office
 then whether they agree or disagree with what's going on they go okay i hear whyi see why that might have happened
 let's talk about this and we can again all push forward in a positive directionthat benefits i guess everyone's journey
 throughout the activity and now

1:31:06
Speaker 1 :on top of all that there's moods okay
 i mean especially lately uh i think two days ago

1:31:14
Speaker 0 :maybe yesterday no two days ago


1:31:15
Speaker 1 :i've never been that cranky
 in my life i think i i don't know what it wasbut i wanted to tell everybody how much
 they annoyed me it was like i i was just very consciousof this feeling
 of like why why is this happening right nowso i consciously decided as i usually do
 in those cases to not say anything to anybodyhow do you do that uh


1:31:43
Speaker 0 :well i you know it's uh it's


1:31:47
Speaker 1 :yeah meditating because it's not i i
 tend to i tend to then visualize what's gonnahappen in the next like how is this
 gonna make my life better like if i say somethingthat mean to somebody else
 i have uh just started a conflict that will just escalate will continuewill add more conflict to my life
 it will make things i just don't like the feeling you will create and so youlive a lot enough life to know that like
 uh it's just like with like street fightingyou know i i i would get into a lot of
 fights when i was younger just on the street but then you realize likeit's not
 like a jiu jitsu match or something like that it's not it'll escalateit'll it'll might come back at you
 it'll like that person might find you again but more importantlythe anxiety of it of
 having created little enemies in this worlddistorts the way you see the world so
 i've noticed that like if i'm shitty to people on the internetwhich i haven't been i think in a long
 time is like it it somehow brings theshittiness to you more and more it
 escalates like the more love you put out therethe more like the people who put love
 out like surround you well you mentioned

1:33:11
Speaker 0 :forgiveness as well like you said
 like i guess back to the original you know the holocaust survivor scenariowe're like oh my god like you think of
 the ultimate in in like i've never experienced oneone billionth of that level of
 of pain and horror and it's like and i can't let this little thing goyou know i guess that's an interesting
 thing i think you're just making the point in your personal lifei guess the same way right yeah there


1:33:34
Speaker 1 :yeah and
 on the internet it's hard i've somehow gotten i mean you'veyou've had a level of celebrity for a
 while i've recently gotten some level of likecelebrity
 and like these people who are just shitty for no reasoncome out from all from all places like
 calling me a fraud or anything else i'm using a jain silent

1:33:58
Speaker 0 :bob strike back they find out a movie's
 gonna be made about them and people are talking on the internet and they'relike what's the internet
 and then someone shows them and they're like what and they go to a message boardand they go to hollywood to try to stop
 it from being made and they eventually get money for their likeness and theyuse the money to buy plane tickets and
 fly around and beat the out of all the people that talk bad about them

1:34:16
Speaker 1 :yeah it's tough i mean it's uh i'm i'm
 having trouble with it because there's people likeyeah there's you know there's posts and
 forums and like heated discussions about is lex vaping a fraud i don't know whathas he really done and there's like
 and then there's people like well i think he's an alright guy but i'm notsure
 like like there's like literal discussions and i'm likelike nobody like if you increase the
 level of celebrity there's going to be like one of thethings that hurts my heart a little bit
 is like some level of toxicity around joe roganfor example
 there's like communities of people that nowlike talk about him selling out for
 example all that kind of stuff and i don't you know and joei've talked to him about it is amazing
 that he uh he says don't read the comments helegitimately doesn't read the comments
 his heart and his soul doesn't give a damn about the commentsall he gives a damn about is his friends
 like one of the things that's really inspiring to me and that's i've had aconversation with them offline about
 spotify and uh the removed episodes people arecurious
 um it's uh it's a thing on the internet where uh i think you can play taylorswift's songs on


1:35:34
Speaker 0 :i'll write that down but you can also


1:35:35
Speaker 1 :now play joe rogan podcast oh cool
 and they gave him 100 million dollars so that that's uhyou know that's awesome it's yeah uh
 but the thing i've had a discussion with him and i made a video about it that itook down because the toxicity
 is like it's hard to put into words but he will give away the 100 million in asecond
 if he ever has to compromise who he is like he doesn't i mean he already saidas he talked about he's
 made quote unquote you money a long time agohe doesn't need any more money he
 doesn't care it's nice to have money whatever butlike he'll give it away so
 the it's nice to see when people like him at a level of celebritylevel success and financial success
 don't change at all they're just the same thing that makes you happy istalking in his case talking with
 his friends in case of most of us really just justhanging out with friends
 doing the things you love in his case doing the things he loves without anylike you know the texas way the uh
 freedom like without any corporate bureaucracy that rolls in and says
 well maybe you shouldn't say you know like more than 20 times a podcastor something like that like those kinds
 like rules like people like he says in a suit and tiethey show up and say
 stuff um oddly enough people that could

1:37:09
Speaker 0 :never to have done


1:37:12
Speaker 1 :what he does yeah exactly and it's kind
 of inspiring to see that and i i hope people i hope peoplerealize how special
 of a human he is he's inspired uh like people like me like i'm just i'ma scientist right so
 he inspired somebody like me from a very different walk of lifeto be like kind to others to be
 open-minded i don't know that uh it's a special dude so like people needto support that and treasure that as
 opposed to uh as opposed to be toxic about it if imean what uh
 i just people really for a long time have told me that itwould be awesome if ryan hall's on
 goes on joe rogan i definitely think that'll be an awesome thinghave you listened to joe has he been
 a part of your life in some kind of way um you know well joe's always

1:38:05
Speaker 0 :i've i remember watching joe on fear
 factor when i was a little kid which is cool so i've actually gotten a like froma from a
 bird's eye view watch you know his his kind of just path through life yeah butone of the things that that i always
 appreciate and again i barely know joe are then to shake his hand heinterviewed me after the uh
 briefing in the ring after the bj penn fight but umone of the things that i've always
 admired about joe is that i think he had  money from the starti think that zero dollars is you
 money for joe i think and that's something i respect about hima great deal um
 because as you say it's interesting to watch it's like you you hopethat uh george saint pierre is like this
 it's really neat now i'm not super close to george but we're teammates at tristarand he's never been anything but a
 gentleman is one of those people that if you didn't know george was famouswhen you walked in the gym you'd have no
 idea he's not holding court not doing it he'sjust you know training and he'll help
 out an amateur doing this if you have a question for him he'll help me like i'mnobody man he
 he would give me advice and train me it was super cool and he didn't kill mewhich i really appreciated he's a
 gentleman but uh you know it's like you you meetsomeone and you go man i'm so
 it's so cool that this is the guy who's the best that this is the guy whowho's been successful and then you go
 why are they successful like i said true to what they're doing they haven'tchanged they're the same as they've been
 and i remember i got to try start in 2012 and george was alreadyalready george st pierre but i remember
 watching and talking to people and they're like oh man george is the sameas he's always been in this neat i see
 him in the gym training now and again giving advice now and it seemslike joe has always been consistent
 and it's neat to watch someone not compromise on their values and notchange who they are and not you know
 periodically like you know again we all make mistakes like you have a bad day orthis or that an apology needs to be
 issued or even my bad or this or that and you're likeyeah they just move on they're not
 afraid to be themselves and they're not afraidto be wrong they're not afraid to make a
 mistake as you as you mentioned open-minded and so i'm like so what arethe correct beliefs to have about this
 that i know going in everyone's going to be okay with what i'm sayingwhich is usually the beginning of a
 conversation that's going to go nowhere rightand uh it's it's neat to see um
 the things i guess that he's created on his own as a resultof the authenticity that's there and it
 reminds me of like dave chappelle and again i don't know i've never met davebut it's neat to see someone that's
 clearly again authentic in their own way doing their own thing and they'rebecause of that they're above the
 corporate nonsense but what's funny i think the message behind all of it ishey guys we all are i can't promise you
 that i'm gonna have money joe couldn't promise you that he'sgonna have money now it ended up working
 out but he was above that nonsense from thejump
 and he just continued to be above it by never giving it any mind and just goinglike yeah i'm gonna be a reasonable
 person i'm gonna try to learn i'm gonna try to growand uh if i say something annoying you
 can come and talk to me about it we get to the bottom of it and i'm like if ineed to say my bed thanks appreciate it
 you know i will and if i don't need to i'm like hey i still appreciate the talkthanks man i'll
 shake your hand and we carry on and we go our separate ways and hopefully i'lltreat you respect you treats me with
 respect and and that's about it and i guess ithink it's a lesson that it can work out
 no matter what you don't have to kowtow to like these weird powers that beand whether you're at this level or at
 this level but you can live your life the way that youwant and as you mentioned talk with
 your friends hang out be happy and it just so happens that thatresonates with people it actually
 reminds me of like speaking to mit and being in boston is like good willhunting you know like again that's
 what he really want to do he could have gone this way could have gone that wayand it was an interesting story but it's
 like this person wants to hang out with hisbuddies and wants to do other things and
 again happens to be brilliant and happens to be able to do all these otherthings
 but there was it i guess it's like at least in my mind a story of authenticityas well
 and it was both the same thing in the robin williams character and i i justthink that that's a message because
 watch watching things occur on the internet asthey do now things so many things
 playing out in the public eye i feel like so many private or otherwiseformerly private discussions and
 disputes and and you know interactions now become theyall have a a well what is this going to
 say when it goes public so how can i couch what i'm saying orhow can i word this in a way that's
 going to get people on my side to use the right buzzwords and not use thewrong buzzwords
 and it's just neat to see people you know in their own way flip the bird tothat
 because i just think that that's that's just not how a human being is meant tothink or interact


1:42:20
Speaker 1 :i'm curious what you think about the
 thing that recently has you know me like hosting this podcast i sometimesthink about like
 who should i talk to and not in terms of like it's the the old hitlerquestion
 now hitler i would definitely talk to because post world warii because everyone knows he's evil the
 question whether you talk to hitler in 1937 like whenpeople who are really students of what's
 going on understand that this is a very dangerous human being buta large number of part of the world
 they're like well he's a leader who cares for germanyso
 the question i have it's interesting to me it involves a particular personnamed who also lives in austin texas
 named alex jones i don't know if you're familiar with the

1:43:15
Speaker 0 :guy i am familiar with mr jones


1:43:17
Speaker 1 :uh i've actually recently just listened
 to infowars like one episode of his uh show i guessthat he does every day
 and it kind of reminds me of a time in college when i drank too muchtequila there's no turning back
 like no it's like like the the mistakes you make that likeit it it's i mean you don't know where
 you're gonna wake up you don't know who you're gonna kill ornot kill or steal or rob
 it it's it's unclear so that that it felt likei was getting pulled into a dark place
 where pretty much everybody is a pedophilethat's trying to control the world
 so bill gates definitely is a pedophile everybody in power anybody in powerthere's a kind of a deep skepticism
 about power and a conspiratorial way to see the world whereeverything is like dark forces in all
 corners it's like the way you feel when you're akid that there's a monster hiding in the
 closet which is also why you leap over the bed

1:44:23
Speaker 0 :from like four feet away
 there's a strategy yes so but he says

1:44:26
Speaker 1 :that you're just being weak you need to
 look under the bed under the bed there's monsters and weneed to be aware of them because they're
 growing they're multiplying you should be and

1:44:36
Speaker 0 :they're touching children


1:44:38
Speaker 1 :they're touching children exactly so it
 all connects but the the i when i listened to himand i thought about like do i want to
 talk to him on this podcast for example when i listened to his conversation withjoe
 rogan the two times he talked on there to me it wassomehow entertaining like it was fun to
 listen to it's fun to listen to a madman go on for four hours becauseit's almost like theater um like this is
 what i talked to joe about when people try to censor alex jones joesays
 that the people who try to censor him don't give enough credit to theintelligence of human beings to like
 understand like that like what a person says on a large platform does notnecessarily
 is not the truth you can be a madman and say crazy thingsand people are intelligent enough to
 hear uh certain things be when they're saidlike
 the earth is flat they can they can be intelligent enough not toall of a sudden start believing that the
 earth is flat like they they're intelligent enough tosort of select
 different ideas and be able to enjoy the theater of a particular ridiculousover-the-top conversation without
 being sort of influenced where they start believinglike toxic set of beliefs now
 there's a lot of sort of other kinds of people especially nowwith cancer culture that say well you
 don't want to give platform to crazy people that that ultimately whosebeliefs might lead to
 dangerous consequences like and i see it very often now withconspiracy theories that go that go like
 way too far like for example would i i'm not i haven't looked into itso i'm sorry i will look into it
 but uh it hurts my heart to see that on bill gatesin my opinion the person who has saved
 and improved more lives than probably any human in historyliterally because of the money he's
 invested in helping like just just the work he's done onlike malaria in africa
 the number of people he's helped is huge and yetevery interview anything you see now on
 bill gates everyone is calling him i believehaven't looked into it
 but i believe everyone's calling him a pedophile i don't know the fullstructure of it
 but it's it's just a very it feels like anarmy of like it feels like it's hundreds
 of thousands of people that's what it feels likeit might be a much smaller percentage
 but it feels like a huge number of people are calling them a pedophile sothat's the
 that's the flip side if you allow if you give platform to conspiracy theorieslike that
 then you start to have bigger and bigger percent of the population believe inthese crazy things
 i just i wanted to put it out there because i don't know what tothink of that if you put yourself in joe
 rogan's shoes if you put yourself in my shoes if youput yourself just in your own shoes


1:47:48
Speaker 0 :i'm in my shoes right now great if
 you're staying your shoes just stay in

1:47:51
Speaker 1 :your shoes can i have your work
 would you talk would you give platform to people like alex joneswould would you talk to somebody like
 alex jones or or not uh i

1:48:07
Speaker 0 :yes i would and i feel very strongly
 about this honestly um well i think that it's it's aninteresting thing and i
 i would just say a lot of times i can understandyou know very very clearly why people
 would take issue with the idea of i guess what they perceive to beamplifying this man's voice
 this man's reach um you know as as a demonstrable negative but i think umyou know when you take a step back
 further uh the the cure is more damaging than thedisease and significantly so
 um i guess i think that i'm very very wary of i think beingwhere you mentioned
 alex jones being wary of power and people with it that'sa lot of times there's a lot of truth
 and validity to crazy things that people sayit's the conspiracy theories that stick
 are the ones that sound credible at least quasi-credible in someaspect and it's almost like it seems to
 me like an anchor in people's mind and it is also funny to me obviously thethe bill gates
 it's so funny to tar people with things like pedophile racistrapist like these are things that we're
 basically trying to pick words that no one can ever support someone who doesthese things
 yeah and that's you know and that

1:49:25
Speaker 1 :changes year by year
 currently pedophile is totally in as a thing to call somebodyjust just as a it used to be communist
 or marxist

1:49:35
Speaker 0 :cleveland browns fan you know like come
 on you know who

1:49:39
Speaker 1 :actually nobody likes the bronze so yeah
 i'll agree i felt that that was that's

1:49:42
Speaker 0 :why i picked one that's the trick
 is you find a group of people that nobody likes we're good hereall right that's the move but uh yeah
 that's a creepy thing though because that is that is the creepy thing it'slike people are always looking for
 groups of people are always looking for and i find this really deeply disturbingum like hey so who's the guy that we can
 all get away with you know just treating like dirt who'sthe guy that i can be a dick to
 i can just walk up and punch in the face and no one's gonna say anything yeah andit's
 even if i you know people do that with whether it's literal nazis or someonethat i called nazi
 you know i guess what's the bigger issue this person's ridiculous beliefs or whati'm doing
 and you mentioned hitler before and obviously mein kampf being a you knowlike the outline for some of the things
 he did later and when the evil was it always theredid it did it take root later on or to
 flourish later on but was was adolf hitler a problembecause he had crazy ideas or because he
 did things i think it's because it's not ithink i know it's because he did things
 now if i'm going to start punishing thought crimei i'm going to have to start punishing
 thought crime and that's a terrifying concepteven if i'm right about the certain
 about the objectively correct about the things that i decide to call out ofbounds
 who put me in charge and made me arbiter of good taste and how long until idecide that something
 else is is out of bounds it's always a sliding scale or it's always just asliding standard
 and i i find that that you know to be more of a concern than people doingcrazy things because i guess if you
 mention alex jones you know putting out ridiculous ridiculous ideas ridiculoustheories i think that most people don't
 look at alex jones as a credible person no i'm not going to pretend to be deeplyread into all of his beliefs or the
 things that he's trying to peddle um but there's plenty of things that arequasi mainstream
 that i think on with this side or that side that maybe not comparablyridiculous but
 are yeah you know particularly in hindsight or you know arewe're not or silly and i guess uh
 the idea of of getting a group of people together to decide what we're not goingto tolerate
 is a very very tricky thing and i think that you knowit reminds me of law or
 you know even you know religion when it gets to like what are the things that wedon't like how do we feel about
 rape it's like no under no circumstances is that an acceptable behaviormurder no that's not acceptable behavior
 killing i don't know kind of depends on thesituation are you at war were you
 justified were you acting in self-defenseokay so it's not now murder is a
 specific type of killing the same way you know other thingsshould be a specific type of something
 else but i guess we we draw a line of murder we say if you want toexist in our society you can't do this
 this cannot be done and then we go theft if someone said heyi murdered that guy can you understand
 where i'm coming from i might say yeah i'll hear you out doesn't mean that ithink you're right
 but i'm like have you ever been wronged so deeply that you could imaginethat you could kill someone i'm like no
 i haven't but i could conceptualize someone doing that and i'm likeyeah okay and you still need to go you
 still need to face you know criminal justice as we have it in our systemat least that's how we've decided yeah


1:52:44
Speaker 1 :there's it's interesting you have to be
 able to like there's if you look at the history of discoursein this country
 i think it's still true but i'm not sure it's changed since 9 11.is uh it used to be impossible to
 criticize um a soldier it was easier to criticizewar it was harder to criticize soldiers
 for allowing themselves to be the tools of wari tend to be maybe it's the russian
 upbringing it's the it's the combat thing i tend toromanticize
 war and soldiers i see soldiers as heroesbut i've also heard people that not only
 say that soldiers are the war is bad they saysoldiers are bad what's their argument


1:53:32
Speaker 0 :

1:53:33
Speaker 1 :it's it's the kind of a libertarian view
 that they're basically slaves to evilright war is evil and they're they're
 giving they are suspending their moral andethical like as like duties as a human
 being to become the tools of evil that's sortof the argument if you see war as evil
 i mean i think it's useful to hear that but there for a long part in historythat was completely unacceptable
 same with abortion if you see abortion as

1:54:11
Speaker 0 :murder i mean if i classify it in that
 if i put it in that in that basket

1:54:18
Speaker 1 :it starts we're living in the midst
 of like a genocide

1:54:24
Speaker 0 :from that perspective could you feel how
 people could be deeply upset by abortion you know of courselooked at from a different perspective
 you say i don't believe it to be murder that's not how i see itthen you go oh well if that's the
 genesis of your your thought process then you're like yeah okay now i see howwe can
 come to a different thing but i guess we go well abortion is murder periodtherefore if you support it you support
 murder that's a convenient way for me to taryou right but i guess
 that's kind of coming back to the alec jones i'm i'm this

1:54:53
Speaker 1 :nuance it's uh you have to have the
 nuance in these kinds of conversations

1:54:57
Speaker 0 :and i have to be willing to have the
 conversation and i have to be willing to sit down if i can't sit down across fromlike the most
 violently racist angry hypothetical internetyou know conceived person that none of
 us have ever actually met in real life but or hopefully not um you know and golike well
 of course i believe that this person's wrong but allow me to change do my besti'll hear him out and i'll go no i can
 go point by point and explain why this guy or this girl is wrongand hopefully bring them over to a more
 reasonable position where they will have better beliefsand they will like objectively better
 beliefs and beliefs that will will and they'll treat other peoplebetter why would i want to marginalize
 this person now i might not want to talk i might want to invite them to mybarbecue if they're acting like a jerk
 all the time but how could i would it not make theworld a better place if i'd hear them
 out and they go look if you're going to sit down and talk with mewe're going to have to have a discussion
 i'll hear what you have to say and if i can'tif i can explain to someone why their
 ridiculous belief is wrong then i might i must not be so confidentin my position and i guess that's where
 i come back to the alex jones thing as you mentioned you know with uhwith bill gates and and you're much more
 familiar with with the specifics of all the good that he's done but you knowagain he's been an unbelievable force
 for good you know in this world you can list a b c d things that the manhas has done that his foundation has
 done and you know positive things and then theother people could speculate about
 ridiculous crazy levels of of evil but you can't produce any evidence for thatsort of thing
 because if you could the man would find himself in trouble you know and anyway iguess what i would would say
 is that why you can't force me to accept the truth the same way you could writedown two plus two equals four on a piece
 of paper and show me how it works and i could saynah but that doesn't make it not true
 and you've still given yourself an opportunity to present your case you'vepresented it to me
 and you've also for anyone listening and watching you know you've been able tocritically
 assess what's gone on you know or critically address back and forth youknow kind of the the discourse
 and i think that you almost you're making your case for the public so iguess like
 you know when it comes to just never not engaging with these people that seems tome to be cowardly and i think that
 that's a something that we're seeing in societyright now i think i think we're seeing a
 crisis of courage in society all over the place and ithink that's where we're seeing poor
 leadership i think we're seeing understandable things happeningeverywhere but we need stronger voices
 and stronger stronger beliefs that have a convictionand are willing to engage with others
 not just turning into a shouting contest and not i didn't win because there'smore of me oh i voted i outvoted you
 that's nice too but that's a stand-in for bullets that's saying i won becausethere's more of me that doesn't mean
 that i'm right because plenty of horrible and unpopularnow things have been very very deeply
 popular in the past and would have won a popular vote does that make them righti'd said clearly not so i guess uh you'd
 hope that we engage with these people and that you can do your best to bringthem over to a more reasonable position
 if you believe that you have one and if you can't well at least you madethe effort and i think that that's
 something where martial arts shows the value it's like or do you know ifyou're going to go win your next fight
 i'm like i have no idea i will proceed forward with with fulleffort and and
 you know i will fight with dignity i'll fight with honor and i'll fight withcourage
 and i i'll use everything that i have and i will play within the bounds of thegame and that's that
 and the result will be what it'll be but i'll walk into and out of that ring withmy head held high because i will know
 that i did my part i did my job the outcome the specific outcome is notin my control it's just strongly in my
 influence and and i think that that's somethingthat helped me that martial arts has
 taught me because other times even when i was successfulor unsuccessful i would focus on
 if i won i'm i won therefore i'm good i lost therefore i'm bad this other guywon or lost therefore
 as opposed to evaluating their method and i think it's so easy when we'retaking a bird's-eye view of things to
 not evaluate how someone's doing things you're notevaluating my process you're simply
 evaluating my outcome and i could have stumbled into something very very goodor very very bad
 and we can look back and i think that's the value of history i mean i don't meanto get on my dang high horse but it's
 like that's the value of history we can see the unbroken chain orthe chain of events that led us
 somewhere and then only with only with the eyes of history can we trulyevaluate things unless we're in the room
 watching it happen and i guess that's again where we startto go
 most of the big bad scary things that have happened in history that are doneparticularly on an industrial scale
 which implies governmental power and things like that or these the equivalentinvolve groups of people getting
 together and going hey we're not going to deal with that guygiant groups of people so maybe we're
 right this time but maybe we're wrong next time and iguess i would be back to the gandalf
 putting on the one ring i would be very very hesitant even if we thought we werein the right
 to simply try to try to marginalize just on general principle even people likealex jones whom
 on their face are pretty ridiculous like you said you should sit down with adolfhitler and talk to the man
 i agree with you to play a little

1:59:38
Speaker 1 :devil's advocate
 is alex jones might be a bad example but if we look atbecause he has a face he is a human he's
 a real person there's also trolls on the internet4chan the worry i have with
 those folks is that and there might be parallels to martial arts is theypractice guerrilla warfare
 meaning they don't necessarily want to arrive at the truththey just always want to cut at the
 ankles of the powerful like they want to alwaysbreak down
 the powerful and even if they i mean it's they turn everything into agame so they
 let's see if we can make the world let's see if we can make a trend that billgates is a pedophile
 right they make it into a game they get excited about this gamethey see the powerful let's see if we
 can convince that like who is the most positive person we can think oflet's see if we can turn them into evil
 and they've tried that with like with like everybody and some and itseems to stick and they're good at it
 assam would argue whatever you think about our current presidentthat he has some elements of that which
 is he's figured out whatever this music ofsocial
 discourse that's going on he's figured out how to alwaystroll the mainstream
 like flow of consciousness that's the the mediahe always kind of says stuff that annoys
 a very large number of people and he enjoys that because it's liketaking the powerful taking the way
 things were before and he like shakes it up by saying themost inappropriate thing almost on
 purpose or instinctually and so on the problem i have with that is thatdoesn't
 the powerful thing there is it uh brings the power the those in power downa notch that's a great thing
 the negative thing is it doesn't push us closer to a nuancedcareful rigorous discourse towards
 truth it's like showing up to a party and just likestarting to yell it doesn't create a
 good conversation it just makes everything into a gamewhere truth doesn't
 even seem like a thing we can even hope to achieve

2:02:02
Speaker 0 :like that makes sense and i guess as you
 mentioned it'll come back to another movie because i don't do books and domovies some people just want to watch
 the world burn right and i guess there's that's a creepycreepy you know kind of urge that some
 people have and it also is some people you're like hey would youlike to throw a brick through that glass
 window and you're like yeah sure like no i'm not going to dothat because i think about
 what's going to what's going to what's going to occur like something's going tobe hurt someone's property not going to
 do it versus hey you want to see what'll happen likeyeah sure you know kids are always like
 i have my son he just grabbed spider-man and dropped smalltable spider-man fell my spider-man
 didn't fall shawn like he dropped him you knocked him off thetable and he'll grin
 and basically uh you know it's it's an interestingthing like you said like playing that p
 these people are appealing to and you know and also almost like thelittle dog
 factor of like i people do want to watch the powerful get taken down a notch forall the good and the not
 good of that because plenty of people it seems to me that have found their way toincredibly high positions some some have
 just found themselves there and many many many many many peopleyou know men and women of of all
 backgrounds are brilliant and have worked hard and yeah of course there'sluck and there's
 there's luck into everything there you know lebron james in spite of being thebest basketball player on god's green
 earth is fortunate that he didn't get hit by acar you know it's fortunate they didn't
 tear his knee you know but thankfully we get to seeall these things you know but um
 i i guess uh it's if people don't have any skin in thegame you never know what they're gonna
 do and i think that's the problem with the internetyou know that people get to be nameless
 be faceless that's why guerrilla fighters are outside of thebounds of war like you don't have a
 uniform on you're like i don't know who you're fromyou don't get the same treatment that a
 soldier gets um for and people well that's crazyactually there's reasons for this
 because otherwise people are able to assail things andthere's no there's no one responsible
 there's no way to go and say hey where's where did this come from what's the rootof this what how can i address this
 and i think that's the problem of the internet's problem on twitter's problemplaces like 4chan i wouldn't
 mind seeing that type of stuff go away if i'm frank but that's not the samething as
 people with a face people with people who are willing to stand thereand say hi my name is so and so even if
 i have ridiculous beliefs hopefully you know people will hear me out and thenif i'm wrong educate me but i i guess
 you hope that the real i guess in my mind antidote to all ofthis silliness
 is education and and i think that that's something that we'reyou know critical thinking is is not
 necessarily i went to school in america andyou know i feel very fortunate but
 critical thinking is not something that'sthat's focused on i mean and it's it's
 tough it's almost like talking about jiu-jitsu it's tough to teach criticalthinking when i don't know any words you
 have to teach me techniques you can't teach me to be an artistbut recognize that the techniques are
 the beginning not the end ultimately it's the artistry that we'researching for not just the
 not just the science or the or the by rote memorization and i guessyou know you'd hope that people's
 ability to think critically and recognize that majority rule orwhoever's loudest does not mean that
 they're right by any stretch of the imagination and we don't appeal to thatand we don't bow to that
 will help them to help inoculate them against the ridiculous things that comeout of these places these dark places
 that that are objectively not great but the iguess
 all circling back if even if we swatted these you know thesebad things out of existence right now
 we've got to be very very careful doing that because it's who's doing theswatting
 this political group that's in power right now the people that support ourcurrent president would maybe feel a
 certain way the people that support another option would feel differently asto
 what exactly defines toxic and i you know i guess thatthat's what gives me pause yeah and but


2:05:40
Speaker 1 :also the grace thing
 i tend to believe that the the technology you said education but thethe platforms we use like twitter and
 the reddit and all these platforms have arole to play to teach us
 grace meaning they ins they should help us incentivizethe kind of behavior that is
 incentivized in real life like being a dick in real life is notincentivized
 like one-on-one interaction like there's cases where it is but usually being kindto each other
 is incentivized on the internet it's not like you get likes for beingfor mocking people in a funny in a
 humorous way and it can be dark kind of mocking depending on thecommunity you can go you can go to the
 appearance if somebody's a little fat or a littletoo skinny
 you can comment on their appearance the hairthe way their hair looks like the
 appearance stuff it could be on the people comment all the timeon the uh level of eloquence of my
 speech

2:06:46
Speaker 0 :go yourself i like it it's creepy
 though watching watching previously like this used to belowbrow though like people doing this
 type of stuff it's creepy watching like our political figures getinto this type of game yes but again


2:06:57
Speaker 1 :it's a little bit refreshing right it's
 a the my hope with donald trump wasis that he would shake up the the people
 who wear suits usually the like if you're from dc i rememberlike showing up
 i actually didn't wear what i usually wear in dc because i was likeeverybody's wearing a suit and tie when
 i was like giving talks and stuff except for mudge

2:07:24
Speaker 0 :who wears jeans and a t-shirt doesn't


2:07:26
Speaker 1 :give a damn
 mudge is uh a forever renegade uh but i don't even remember what uh ohyeah so
 my hope with trump was that huge shake up that system just say likelike uh to inject new ideas to inject
 new energy of course the way it turned out isdifferent but like there's uh
 it turns out that you might want to have somebody who's like like an andrew yangtype character
 who is full of ideas that are very differentand inject the energy new energy into
 the system through youthful new ideas versusthrough the troll that like that's
 very good at sort of mocking and like playing outside the the rules of thegame
 but trump did reveal powerfully i don't know what to think of itthat um it's just a game and you don't
 have to play by the rules that's both inspiring and dark deeply

2:08:26
Speaker 0 :depressing right


2:08:27
Speaker 1 :yeah and i don't know what to do with it
 i don't i mean the same i'm not drawing parallels not drawingparallels between our president
 and adolf hitler but it certainly and there's a lot ofin history a lot of positive and a lot
 of negative things happen when charismatic leaders realize theydon't have to play by the rules
 you can just flip the table it's the that uhuh kevin spacey show no house cards
 house of cards where you just flip the table or whatever you don't have to playby the rules of the chess game you can
 flip the table one wonders if that's

2:09:02
Speaker 0 :always been done in private
 you know i guess because that's i mean even look obviously the united states isa as a republic but
 we had we had bush then we had clinton and we had more bush than we hadpresident obama then we were about to
 have another clinton that's fairly creepy yeah even on its own but

2:09:21
Speaker 1 :now we added another i mean i'm sure
 we'll have a generation of trumps no gee we uh you know i'm russian soi think we humans like kings still
 and queens there's something we're attracted to the the thing wetalked about coaches
 there's something in us that longs towards that authoritariancontrol one of the beautiful things
 about america the second amendment uh is uh we alsolike
 individual freedom that's one of the one of the unique aspectsat the founding of this country and
 still and for me is the beacon of hope that uhsomehow there's the fire freedom burns
 in there like that texas feel that i that gives me hope the fu energythat revolts against the power which as
 we discussed power corrupts and ultimately leads to sort ofuh degradation of the whoever's
 ruling is the people it's interesting

2:10:25
Speaker 0 :though like it seems to me maybe i'm
 just i don't know if i'm reading this properly when i when i see it but it'sit seems to me that
 that like you said that that you know flip the bird i'm gonna do mewithin reason like as long as i'm not
 hurting you uh is idea that that very much at least inmy mind defines the american ideal or at
 least part of the consciousness of the united statesis is under attack to a certain extent
 you know um in if only like i can think to like youknow maybe a generation
 behind us um it's it's becoming more collectivist yeah you know for allthe good and also the not
 good of that and it's uh you know not in not in termsnot in terms of policy at this point but
 just in terms of like uh the consciousness and i wonder if that'sa an internet thing you know people are
 more in touch with one another than they'veas far as i can tell they've ever been
 at least more than in my lifetime and uh you know the rest of the worldseems much closer than it did you know
 living in virginia california seems very far away being onthe internet it's just right there i can
 hear about it i can see it i can i can interact with people fromthere you know i remember uh
 you know being in tennessee at uh you know one time and thenand reading about you know events taking
 place in you know the middle east and it just seemed like a mile away itseemed like a
 unbelievably far distance and then another time when you're in dc you justfeel like oh you read about something
 happening in paris and it just feels like it's just right around the cornerbecause dc is a seat of a seat of power
 where things are just occurring all the time anduh you know i guess you you wonder about
 that's where i come back to the group decisions tonot listen to this person or to cancel
 this or to you know we all the moral majority shall do thefollowing as opposed to as long as
 you're not hurting me and long as you're not hurting anyoneelse i have to let you do i have to let
 you be on general principle even if i don't like you i'm very free to not likeyou i'm free to speak out against you
 but i'm not it is not within my right or and notwith it and it's not i
 i would not be right to attempt to attack youand that is an interesting thing though
 when we see words being redefined or words being defined whether it'stoxicity whether it's violence
 if i think that what you're saying is is your speech is by itselfyou know a violence or a precursor to
 violence i'm justified in doing all sorts of thingsyou know and and that creeps me out
 significantly because again even if it ends up being pointed in a gooddirection initially
 it's only a matter of time and actually that brings me to uhanother dune oh yeah i got all day
 um how much are they paying you but wait about say the uh the frank herbertestate not enough frankly
 oh let's see and how many books are

2:13:02
Speaker 1 :there in dune


2:13:05
Speaker 0 :that's a gen question you're also a fan


2:13:07
Speaker 1 :of


2:13:09
Speaker 0 :i read the whole series but
 not a couple of the i read all the prequels as well it was the exception ofa couple


2:13:16
Speaker 1 :is there a book one for dune dune it


2:13:19
Speaker 0 :would be book one
 and even the prequels it's still all better if you startlike i read dune and then read the
 original what is it six and then i went back and started to readsomething like just like watching star


2:13:29
Speaker 1 :wars
 you want to start at episode four or whatever yeah

2:13:35
Speaker 0 :i think so that's the way that's the
 move and then stop at six call it a day watch the mandalorian and

2:13:40
Speaker 1 :but well i thought you're not walking
 back here

2:13:42
Speaker 0 :no i like the mandalorian yeah that is
 what i said yeah i was told that i was heartless fornot liking baby yoda boy
 we don't talk about a couple of the moviesnot including the middle or in the
 middle and it's fine it's the more recent movies that we don't like totalk about yeah oh the


2:13:59
Speaker 1 :what's his name the the goofy guy uh
 ryan no no no the creature the goofy creature

2:14:05
Speaker 0 :with the jar jar
 yeah jar jar do you ever see the the the jar jar binks is actuallylike the dark lord of the sith theory
 that fixed the whole initial trilogy we're like he'she's like goofing around and like making
 it all the way through battles and when you're like wait a minute he oops hisway he
 walks over to a pool does a triple backflip falls in you're likeit's just bizarre this is the this is


2:14:24
Speaker 1 :the alex jones
 theory of of star wars he's actually

2:14:29
Speaker 0 :running
 one that actually was like hey we should vote in chancellor chancellor palpatineor senator palpatine like right before
 they put jar jar in charge first off what did they think was gonna happenand second off that was i just think
 that'd be great like oops oh man i guess he's the emperor nowthat would have been great but actually
 to the to the cancel and all the other stuff againit's just you'd hope that it gives pause
 and i think about this for fighting because a lot of timesi'll use this example people and people
 like fight fans and you know like ufc they love people that run out andtry to murder each other and it's
 entertaining and it's super entertaining but you knowfloyd mayweather doesn't resonate with
 people as much it's like people start i remember the time when floyd wasnot as popular now people think people
 love floyd because he's 50-0 floyd and oh man and finallyhe had so much success that we all can't
 help but recognize the man's genius and greatness but prior to thatoh he's boring he's this he's that
 he fights you know with he's circumspect he's cautious he's he's pressinghe's intelligent deeply intelligent and
 uh when you watch people go out and try to murder each other you can flip a coin100 times and
 you know you can get you could be lucky enough to get 100 heads but it's still acoin flip
 and i think that that's what's going on all the time isyou know people are getting an outcome
 that they want but it wasn't a well thought out situation and that's whyyou'll win
 by five in a row by knockout and then lose three in a row and then people willgo well what happened to that guy he
 used to be so great no he's doing what he's always beendoing it's just it was getting great
 outcomes on a coin flip prior and it's getting negative outcomes on acoin flip now but uh
 i guess what i would say is it watches it's interesting watchingyou know i guess societal beliefs become
 such a a thing that we're almost adopting on a religious level if we'renot careful
 and if if when i say religious level i mean like like pan lifelike this is guiding all of my choices
 for all the good and the bad of that and this is the dune quote is when religionand politics travel on the same card the
 writers believe that nothing can stand in their waytheir movements become headlong faster
 and faster and faster they put aside all thoughts of obstaclesand forget that the precipice does not
 show itself to the man in the blind rush until it's too lateand i think that that's again the the
 pause we go oh man thank goodness we have this guy that wants to rebuildgermany he'll put us back where we need
 to be and you stop questioning any your own

2:16:40
Speaker 1 :judgment your own
 just you start you stop thinking essentially right i'm not allowed to

2:16:45
Speaker 0 :question this oh
 of course this is correct of course this girl of course i'm right i intended todo right so of course my actions are
 correct i mean how many times have any of us intend to do something helpful andended up doing something less and you
 know plenty of people who intend to do harm could by accidentdo something decent and i guess it's
 like you know i'm not saying anything you know terribly terribly you knowinsightful but it's just one of those
 where it's hard it's hard to say in the momentand that's where
 you hopefully caution you would counsel some degree of cautionand uh that that's what worries me with
 with people deciding that we're all so right about this or we're also rightabout that and
 attempting to rather than win the argumentsilence the counter-argument no matter
 how crazy it may seem because i just think that that idea evenwhen it's pointed in a good direction
 initially it's only a matter of time

2:17:34
Speaker 1 :you're amongst many things
 a jujitsu black belt one of the things that people are really curious aboutwhite belts and blue belts and jiu jitsu
 but also people haven't tried the art is what does it take to be a jiu jitsublack belt


2:17:51
Speaker 0 :i think that you know everyone's journey
 is a little bit different but the one thingthat the it was a calvin coolidge
 quote you know determination persistence is the only thingthat that will win in the end it will
 always win in the end not brilliance not toughness noteducation
 it's it's persistence and i think that having the belief thatno matter what happens to me i will
 proceed forward and i will i will figure out how to make this happen hell or highwater
 i think is the one thing that ties together all of the people that i'veever met
 that made it through whatever it was that they were going throughbecause you know sometimes you can get
 lucky and you can have an easy time or and that luck could be you had a goodsituation it could be
 i mean like in the obvious sense of like where you're living where you'retraining what's going on you had a good
 situation you're un unbelievably athletic oh you'reyou're going to be an astronaut you're
 brilliant and an olympic athlete you know like wellthat's a fantastic situation
 you know you won the genetic lottery and i've worked hard as well but you alsowon the genetic lottery
 it's a determination is the one thing though becausethat person could have a very easy go of
 it initially and then tear their knee and then they're no longer the thesuperhuman physical specimen that they
 were the only thing that will keep them goingis persistence and i think that that um
 i would just say that persistence to say i'll just put one foot in front of theother and sometimes i can see the path
 ahead and sometimes it's beyond my vision buti will not stop
 i may even slow down but i won't stop and that's the only thing that i can saythat i've seen tie everyone together
 because there's so many ways to the top of any mountain and there's so manydifferent personalities and skills and
 backgrounds involved but everyone everyone carries on

2:19:32
Speaker 1 :so at the core the foundational advice
 is just don't quit just keep going that's the lesson of

2:19:37
Speaker 0 :martial arts i think you know we think
 it's like how to be strong or how to be how to win but inreality it's like how to persist how to
 endure because it's all of us have been beaten so many timesand gotten beaten up so many times and
 thought about quitting have i ever thought about quitting absolutely have iever quit
 never i will never ever quit ever i can say you might not be out i will bedamned if i quit what's the darkest


2:19:58
Speaker 1 :moment is it injury related like is that
 is it uh so like to me like two possibilitiesi've fortunately never been seriously
 injured but i think that's a dark place to be like having tobe out for many months
 uh for um as jen was saying like with a head injury especiallylike the uncertainty that's one
 and then the other side is if you have big ambitions as a competitor realizingthat
 you're not as good like those those doubts were like i kind of suckhow am i supposed to be a world the
 greatest fighter of all time if i if if like several people in thegym are kicking my ass
 those are the two things that paralyzing i think

2:20:49
Speaker 0 :that everyone's darkest moment is maybe
 different looking from the outside for ryan iwouldn't say that he's had injuries
 and he said bad ones i wouldn't say that was his darkest momenti think for me i would say some my head
 injury was my darkest moment absolutely and i have torn my acl twicei've torn my shoulders four times i've
 had lots of surgeries for me the orthopedic injuries were notthe most
 difficult it was the brain injury for others that might be the case for themmaybe they've never
 experienced an injury and maybe for them that's their darkest momentfrom the outside obviously orion can
 speak to this more but for ryan i think it was theum inability to to perform at certain
 points to the upper the missing of opportunities that forhim from my perspective watching him
 go through and having seen various points of his growth fromfrom early purple bought on i think the
 hardest time for him looking in obviously was when he would hit momentswhere he wasn't able to perform
 for various reasons he couldn't get fights he was having difficulties therei think that
 that was the hardest point for him did

2:22:00
Speaker 1 :you did you think like with the head
 injury that you might not never be able to do jiu jitsu againyeah i mean i


2:22:05
Speaker 0 :i mine was very um was really bad and it
 was just the one hit but i had a looping memoriesfor seven months didn't know it because
 when your brain's messed up you're not even aware that you're loopingand so i saw two different neurologists
 i find like it took a very long time um i didn't know if i was going to beable to have like linear thoughts or
 read a book i didn't know at certain points if i could listen to music againyou know without it making my head hurt
 um and so uh it was almost two years before i wokeup in the morning without a headache
 um just waking up before i even start my dayand so that so that's even bigger than


2:22:44
Speaker 1 :jujitsu that's just life


2:22:46
Speaker 0 :that's just that's just hard and i think
 that you can experience so many things i'vehad all these injuries
 we lost the baby when i was 15 15 weeks and we've had all these experiences andwhat the hardest point for me
 not saying all those things weren't hard but it's kind of likeas you go through these you just realize
 like life goes on and you have to keep working at it and you have to keep goingand
 you asked me earlier offline did i feel depressed andnot from my head injury i don't think
 that at least in the moment i had a any recognition of that it's kind oflike but i think different people's
 personalities i have kind of the like buckle down and just keep going andsometimes it's not until
 lots of time later that you realize wow that was really hardbecause you're just struggling to live
 and and function and do the things that you need to do alone do you mind

2:23:39
Speaker 1 :jumping on just like this part of the
 conversation just for a few minutes it's over do you mind you know just sittingtogether oh no no
 just for a little bit sorry be cool be cool so we put a face to it you knowuh is it okay with you yeah it's fine


2:23:55
Speaker 0 :with me if it's fine


2:23:56
Speaker 1 :by the way what was the head injury if
 you don't mind sharing someone hit their head dropped their

2:24:00
Speaker 0 :knee on the back of my head during
 training who's a lot bigger than me so one strike to the back of the head istoo much for someone there's a reason
 that's outlawed in mma right someone 50 pounds everything you drop theirrunning on the back your head once and
 it's that's the funny thing about getting hitright you never can really be sure
 what's going to happen i think that's actually one of themagical parts about jiu jitsu where like
 if you choke me if you we know what's going to occuryou hit someone they might be completely
 unharmed like you might be punching tony ferguson in the face and like he youneed to hit him with a sledgehammer to
 affect this man and then other people they could getreally badly hurt which i guess
 it's back to your point about you know street fighting and things like that andthe
 serious serious potential you know second third order consequences of anyaction that we take
 but yeah that's a that's a tricky thing about getting hit how does it make you

2:24:48
Speaker 1 :feel that
 like the the really shitty thing about injuries to mewas that like you start thinking like
 well if i did this one little thing differentlike this wouldn't have happened today
 like one one moment changes your entire life isthat
 do you uh do you think that where is that totally counterproductive um

2:25:10
Speaker 0 :you can't help but think that way when
 you've had the amount of injuries i've had now because i've hadmore than most people's fair share um
 as my orthopedic says you don't want to win that you don't want to with thecontest of who's had the most
 but since you haven't actually built me a pool yeah umbut i think you can't help but think
 that way sometimes but i definitely don't think it'si think it can be facilitated if you
 don't beat yourself up too much um because thinking aboutwhy have i been subject to so many
 injuries and and a lot of it comes to just umalmost all of mine in particular are
 people a lot heavier than me so we're talkbut if i've been training martial arts
 15 years i'm obviously on the much smaller side i'm a womani've done thousands and thousands of
 rounds with people 50 pounds plus heavier thanme i mean years
 not training with anyone less than 50 which is 50 pounds is almost half mybody weight
 and when you also add testosterone the naturalphysiological advantages of men not just
 are they heavier with more mass they're faster they're more explosive they'restronger
 if they're the same size and so i think that the willingness to be in thatenvironment
 over and over and over again creates a lot of strength resiliency willingnessto continue
 but it also like in order to do that you almost have touh for me the way i was approaching was
 like pretend like i wasn't more vulnerable um and just bewilling to step in and step in and stuff
 take it until you make it kind of until you make it kind of yeah like i'lljust one day i'll be strong enough


2:26:45
Speaker 1 :and you avoided injury for most for most


2:26:48
Speaker 0 :of those rounds i would injure the
 problem as ryan points out is that like you could do thousands of rounds but ifone person that size that strength that
 however reacts in a way that you don't expect itdoesn't it's not like an oops it's like
 always major

2:27:01
Speaker 1 :do you regret any of it like i think


2:27:03
Speaker 0 :that most no one i know has experienced
 the degree of injuries that i've experienced and i started juice at atime when
 in 2005 is very different than now where you have the coaches have more controlover what you're doing they're more
 aware in general about a lot of the injuriesthere's a lot
 more people who are uh hobbyists than when i started um theywere hobbyists but it was different kind
 of hobbyist you know than now now our girls can train with other girlsthey don't have to do thousands of
 rounds with somebody significantly more powerful than themand
 for the drawbacks and the benefits of that you know as with anythingum so i think
 i think that i don't think i would go back and change it there were timesafter one of my injuries where i said to
 ryan i said i quit i'm done i'm not doing this anymore i probablysaid it more than once but there was one
 time i was really serious in 2012. um i was really serious i tore myshoulder i had
 i was looking at missing a big competition again the world's formy second or third year in a row after
 injuries and i said i'd quit my job two years before and i'm likei'm done and run before that had always
 been you know keep me focused and then hekind of said okay if you want to be done
 be done just just have a good time no i'm reallydone i don't even want to train anymore
 okay okay and then you know i think he helped facilitate a moment for me togo um
 visit a friend some friends some girls that were doing a girls campwho are close to my size or some friends
 of mine to go train and i was like oh waiti do love this thing it's harder for me
 on a daily basis but that doesn't mean i don't love this thingand it really helped change my mind i
 started to connect with other people travel moremyself because previously he had done
 that but i hadn't really done that i think therewas a point where
 um when i started youtube it was just for fun i just wanted to sport aftercollege i played sports as a kid i want
 to i just want to exercise i wasn't into the martial artshe usually gave me a hard time about it
 because he was always very how can you not care about martiali don't know i just want to play sports
 um and ryan was really big into kind of thephilosophy side of the martial arts
 aspect um he used to give me a hard time and ithink after that moment this moment
 where i looked at myself and i said do i want to keep doing thisis when i started to appreciate
 jiu-jitsu take it took off some of the pressure i'd been feeling i thinkas ryan's girlfriend but i had a
 full-time job a long time it was never my goal to be a jiu jitsuworld champion
 and i think after that moment where i like you know i really do like this ireally do want to just i had this moment
 like any time where you're like i'm doing this for me i'm not doing this forhim and i think that that's
 um i think that was really lucky for me because how often in our lives do wehave a kind of a challenge
 where we have to stop and we have to say is this really what i wanthow often in a relationship do you do
 that how often in any type of lifestyle or job do you stop and youreally ask yourself is something really
 difficult happen that you look and you go am i just doing this because it'sconvenient and easy
 or is this what i really want to do yeah

2:30:10
Speaker 1 :i've had those moments like this
 this podcast is one of those things it's likeyou you stop and think like
 i actually love this and it's uh i had that with jiu-jitsu tooi don't think i had set until like brown
 belt did i stop i mean yeah it's when you firstface real challenges
 you think like why am i doing this it's i think most of my progression waswhy not i think that's the right the
 leap of faith and then a certain point you think likewhat why am i doing this and if you can
 answer honestly that because i love it it'skind of a liberating feeling
 it's a it's a yeah it's so it's so powerful

2:30:55
Speaker 0 :thankful for the opportunity to be there
 right because you love it and yeah man

2:31:00
Speaker 1 :great gratitude it's yeah so that's it's
 ultimately gratitude yeah let me ask you this so ryan said likewhat what did i took over your
 thing yeah this is no nobody cares about ryan i wouldn'ti'll photoshop him out or whatever
 however you edit that'd be great

2:31:14
Speaker 0 :put sean connery's head uh just like a


2:31:17
Speaker 1 :dune

Speaker 0 :ad exactly uh connor


2:31:24
Speaker 1 :is that the sexiest man in sean connery


2:31:26
Speaker 0 :in the dune universe that's my
 understanding okay i think in any universe yeah well

2:31:31
Speaker 1 :mind gossiping given we actually named


2:31:33
Speaker 0 :our son after sean connery

2:31:39
Speaker 1 :he was in the rock those i love all

2:31:43
Speaker 0 :nicholas cage oh yeah conairs face off


2:31:44

 awesome i don't know where it's from

2:31:49
Speaker 1 :alabama i guess or something
 well they got like steve buscemi in

2:31:52
Speaker 0 :there like we need steve buscemi in this
 thing and we got him dave chappelle yeah that's right yeahhe's a prisoner


2:31:58
Speaker 1 :eight ball yep greatest movie of all
 time should have won and dave chappelle also

2:32:04
Speaker 0 :in blue streak with martin lawrence
 and then uh what do you call it uh robin who men and sites oh robinwas one of my favorites as a kid half


2:32:11
Speaker 1 :baked but rob yeah
 well that that's a good uh wow we just listed off some really bad90s movies but


2:32:21
Speaker 0 :you take that back we're telling our age
 yeah

2:32:24
Speaker 1 :so what um like in your view i don't
 mean to from like a smaller person i guessthat's an interesting thing while jiu
 jitsu is like that uh small i don'thopefully that's not a bad thing um


2:32:40
Speaker 0 :

2:32:41
Speaker 1 :yeah like with all these like uh bigger
 people you can still enjoy the art like what does it take to get a black beltto excel to quote unquote master the art
 gosh everyone has such a different path

2:32:55
Speaker 0 :ryan's promoted
 six seven people something like that and i think abouthalf of them have had um
 have kids have families have other careers umat the time some of them competed a lot
 some of them have never competed or rarely competed some havebeen commuted a long time
 some had started different places everyone's had different journeyseven in our own little group of seven
 i think only maybe only two or three werehigh level competitors of that group at
 the higher belts very like brown black maybeum and so it's just different for every
 person and that's something that that you know we try to tell her since wehave 400 students
 and um do we have us we don't really have anyone who'syou know a stated other other than like
 the coaches like adam but we don't have anyone that's like astated high-level competitor as a
 student at the moment we people look at our gym like oh it's lotsof competitors there's not lots of
 competitors it's never been lots of competitors and we've had onesand twos here and there
 um but really everybody's in it for the long term if they're in itsometimes the the high level competitors
 are the ones that are more likely to drop off because theyhave a bit of success particularly at
 blue or purple and then they realize how hard it is at brown and black and thenthey they have a hard time continuing
 on that's that path and then they can't look at themselves as a non-competitivehard time continuing with jiu jitsu i
 think whereas sometimes it's the guy who comesin as the white belt and he trains
 you know twice a week every week and the next thing you know he's been there fortwo or three years like oh he's a blue
 bell he's a purple he's a brown bell and and he's justconsistent um over
 over a long period of time and willing to take the pathand no two people's path is exactly the
 same no two people's lives are exactly the sameyou have um we have students who started
 as a white belt as you know a young adult with no you knowno responsibilities and they train all
 the time and then they have a job you know then they graduatecollege and they have a job then they
 have married then they have kids then they have different points in theircareers and at different points in your
 life jiu jitsu will be there you know forwhatever way that you're willing to
 accept it it's place i think well that's actuallykind of what back to the initial
 question we discussed about you know what makes a warrior you knowand and also like what makes something
 or someone you know particularly impressive in mymind is like uh
 what they make out of what they have um you know one of my favorite movies everas far as gump
 and it's obviously it's it's just if you can't uh because i've heard people likeforce gum sucks i'm like i don't like
 you as a person and uh like you have no heart at all butbasically uh
 it's the story of someone that tries hard and it's like yeah but it's it'sfunny movie but it's like um you know i
 guess you meet each person where they are youknow and
 obviously you want everyone needs to be pushed we all need to be pushed we needfriends and people around us that push
 us to be better versions of ourselves all the time and as you mentioned thepeople you spend all of your time around
 deeply impact you um and we have to be willing to be pushed it takes a leap offaith for me to trust
 for me to put some of my self in my my you know i guess my ability mycontrol my personal agency as it were in
 the hands of someone else that i that i trust and and that irespect but
 if if i can do that well again maybe i never becomeyou know high level black belt
 competitor but you know i had four of the things i was doing my life i alsohave a family i have this i have that
 you know what that person was able to accomplish in the martial arts relativeto what they were able to put in this
 phenomenal you know other times someone could be avery successful black belt and it might
 might be a bum because they could have been a lot moreand you know they could have done more
 they could have focused more and and there's no shame in decidingthat you don't want to do that but
 whatever it is that you're you're invested in i remember the uhtake it uneasy podcast
 and that i loved because you know i'll just chill outlike resting it's like vacation oh who
 wants to go on vacation yeah go on vacation for a day or two you want tospend three weeks on vacation like i
 kill myself like get me out of here like this is horriblethis is i'm a waste of life i'm not
 doing anything useful right now technically

2:37:00
Speaker 1 :right now right well this is fun though


2:37:02
Speaker 0 :it's like a one-day vacation yeah
 exactly but if you notice if you had i'm sure you're thinking about jumpingoff of the building right now but if you
 had to if you had to talk to me for you know like uh three days i'm sureyou'd probably shove me off the building
 i don't blame you i would be dead but yeah five hours in but yeah but youknow it is it's like you want to be
 pushing towards something um because otherwise what's the purpose of beinghere
 you know it's not just a college it's doing something usefulbuilding growing as a person helping
 others do the same if that's within your powerat any given time but i think that's
 kind of the neat thing about martial arts is it can be many many differentthings to many different people
 you know i finally for instance i was able to get a college degree let thisthis year
 that which i mean it's not a big deal for most people but for me it was a bigdeal because i was going back and finish
 yeah and i never envisioned ever going back andthat's a hard step to to go back and


2:37:49
Speaker 1 :finish that's uh
 it just weighs heavy on you if you don't it's interesting yeah i was justi was more proud of that than most


2:37:56
Speaker 0 :things i've ever done if i'm honest you
 know and it was neat and i really enjoyed it and it was the process ofdoing it but
 you know are my academic credentials impressive like not in the leastbut for me it's like it was a big deal
 for me personally to take that step and to to go back and do that and i wasi was proud of the
 the direction and because it would have been easy like do i need to do it likeno i'm you know i'm business i'll do
 okay i'll try i'll keep fighting but i i was happy totake the time in between fights when i
 was when i was unbooked for an opponent todo something productive rather than just
 i'll just hang out you know like i can still trainevery single day but i can also train
 and go to school people go to the olympics while going to schooli can i can do martial arts and go to
 school

2:38:37
Speaker 1 :one thing i gotta ask is uh you know
 a bunch of women listen to this podcast if they haven't done jiu jitsu i thinkit'd be kind of intimidating
 to uh stop on the mat with a bunch of brosuh that like enjoy somehow killing each
 other like how do you succeed in thatenvironment to where you can
 learn this art learn how to beat all those people up

2:39:03
Speaker 0 :um oh gosh is there any advice


2:39:04
Speaker 1 :i mean another way to ask that is like
 if if uh any women listening to this areinterested in starting jiu-jitsu like is
 there advice for that journey honestly i think it's just walking in

2:39:15
Speaker 0 :the door and starting
 sometimes i don't know how to respond to that because i'm not i don'tview myself as typically anxious
 particularly in interactions with other people or newpeople
 shy is not a word that has been used for mebut if you ask my family and um they
 joke because our son talks a lot he's advanced verbally and they're alwayslike oh well let's
 we know where he gets that from like because he just doesn't stop talking henarrates everything he does um and so
 they always tease because that's like i'm known forfor kind of talking a lot um but so i
 haven't been typically i'm not i don't consider myself a shyperson so for me going into
 um a new room a new group of people is you know there's there's always that youdon't really know who they are how
 they're going to treat you but i typical but i i don't have a lot of anxiety withthat so i don't if that's something
 that's going to put something up i don't really know howto to address that particular feeling
 um but in terms of all of the rooms i've been in i havepopped in the jutsu jams before i knew
 ryan in florida like i traveled for my jobsin germany and florida and
 in california in places where where i don't know anyone they don't know meand i have never once had anyone
 be anything other than than kind and solicitousand helpful and long before when i was a
 white belt and a blue belt and didn't know anything anddidn't know anyone and i just
 think that it's a community of people that it's so cool that no matter whereyou go in the world
 um i i walked into a gym in prague one time where only two people spoke englishand and it was just yeah it's weird


2:40:59
Speaker 1 :

2:41:00
Speaker 0 :you know it's weird like part of a group
 and they're like oh let me tell you what it is being part of a cult rightyeah yeah but it's like a positive cult


2:41:05
Speaker 1 :like it for sure


2:41:07
Speaker 0 :that's what we would say yeah that's


2:41:10
Speaker 1 :true
 yeah that's true i mean we do need to murder every week of practice aikidoi mean yeah that's this cult uh true
 deeply believes it no but there is a like if you look at different kinds ofgames like chess and so on like
 there's a skepticism i mean there's not abrotherhood sisterhood feeling with jiu
 jitsu it's like you can roll into most placeseven like with judo like i can see the
 contrast like because i've trained in judoplaces it uh


2:41:39
Speaker 0 :

2:41:40
Speaker 1 :it's more like tribal like you walk in
 and like who is this like there's that kind of feeling with jiu jitsu there'suh
 less so there is a little bit with like the competitors there's always likethe competitors feeling each other out
 usually like the blue belts uh but like outside of that in terms of ifyou don't get the
 if you if you walk in with the vibes of justloving the art and just wanting to have
 a good time you're like welcome it's really coolit's really
 fascinating it's a really great um thing

2:42:13
Speaker 0 :i think and as a woman i think you
 you think you're walking into these rooms of these you knowbig strong tough guys and um if anything
 i would i would say that they're almost likemuch more solicitous when a woman comes
 in there and not like they're just like hitting onyou all the time you know it's just that
 you walk in and everyone is like oh cool you want to do this thing that i lovelet me make sure you have a good
 experience and take care of you and i think that's that's an experiencethat that i hope people have when they
 come into our gym and and i've i've always felt when i walkedinto other gyms and so you know we try
 our best to to make that comfortable and and it canbe a little uncomfortable because there
 are when you walk into a male-dominatedenvironment there's
 conversations and topics there's a different style of camaraderie andjoking that a lot of men will do that
 um maybe some women are more uncomfortable with i grew up with fourbrothers so i kind of
 maybe was a little more desensitized to thatum and i worked for the department of
 defense for for a while too so before i i i'd say you're with thegovernment yeah
 so so i did that i'm already skeptical

2:43:21
Speaker 1 :yeah
 i'm not going to ask you about ufos then because you're not going to tell me thetruth
 [Laughter]

2:43:27
Speaker 0 :

2:43:29
Speaker 1 :uh yeah now you just freaked out a lot
 of people okay

2:43:33
Speaker 0 :

2:43:34
Speaker 1 :uh but yeah by the way where's where's
 your school because people always ask like whereuh uh well we're outside of washington


2:43:38
Speaker 0 :dc and northern virginia and falls
 church

2:43:42
Speaker 1 :you always want to pick like what's the
 best school if i travel to this place or if i loif i want to move to this place so
 that's well i mean obviously we're

2:43:48
Speaker 0 :biased but yeah
 we're in the washington dc area the best

2:43:52
Speaker 1 :okay we just took a little break
 now we're back let me ask you uh one thing that a bunch of people are curiousabout
 you're one of the innovators first of all you're one of thegreat innovators and philosophers and
 thinkers in jiu jitsu right but you're also one of the innovators interms of leg locks
 and and the 50 50 position and just like the fact that legs have something to doin jiu jitsu uh
 the the under the other popularizer innovator in the space isjohn donahue
 and his whole group of guys do you have um thoughts abouttheir whole system of leg locks and
 their ideas about jiu-jitsu and so on sure i iguess uh


2:44:35
Speaker 0 :you know obviously you know john and and
 the students at henzo have been able to do fantastic things competitively in thepast number of years and you know um
 you mentioned innovators in the in that kind of you knowsection of jiu jitsu i would be uh i'd
 love to bring up some guys like dean lister um of course uhmazukaze minari in fact a lot of what
 was going on in like 90s japan like combat submissionwrestling there was some crazy gnarly
 stuff that it's just it's on grainy vhs tape butlike stuff that if people were doing now
 they go oh my god that's brand new like there's um it's it's been i thinkthese are things that have been around
 for a while um in various places i first learned the50 50 position just like the leg
 entanglement of it from brandon vera actually at a seminarat lord urban's martial arts i think in
 2005. he learned it from dean lister who usedit to submit
 alexandria cocareco a really really tough nogi guy at adccon the in the run that uh dean made to
 the to the gold medal in the absolute division which was a great performanceat the time first american to do that
 um and uh you know and i actually saw a video i mean first of boss rutinactually broke i think guy mesger's
 foot with a 50 50 heel hook did he actually grabbed his heeland his and his toes and like and in
 pancreas it's back when they had like the man panties and the high uhyeah and uh dude that was gnarly boss
 rooting is underappreciated as like as like he double oh grab like oh yeah

2:45:56
Speaker 1 :

2:45:57
Speaker 0 :like you know his leverage is leveraged
 it's that's like a toehold that's you know that goes the other way andit's like it either doesn't work or
 breaks in half and uh well he's uh people don't often think of

2:46:05
Speaker 1 :boss rooting as an
 innovator but he is in a way like he uh you know talk about like elon muskand first principles thinking in terms
 of physics he like just feels like he just gets thejob he figures out like the simplest way
 to get the job done of breaking things and establishing control and hurtingpeople
 remember that was back in the day if you

2:46:26
Speaker 0 :listen to boss root and do any like
 commentary for any of the uh the big mma shows or any mma show way back when anytime guys were clinching like the gosh
 role for an ebar he was saying that way back when and now people are doing itall the time with varying degrees of
 success it's it's funny it's like it's also tough to beuh i think like a breakaway thinker i
 mean you know groupthink is a real thing in group inertiaand it's it's neat to see um you know
 particularly at a time when maybe that type of stuffwas less accepted
 um you know someone going hey i'm gonna i'm gonna run off in this otherdirection i think you know whoever
 you know the inventor of electricity in my mind is a lot more impressive thanwhomever not to say that the person down
 the line isn't impressive that comes up with an interesting way to use itum both are cool but when you think
 about just can you imagine we're sitting herelike yeah people i'm going to build an
 airplane you're like what are you talking about it's crazy people don'tfly i'm like no i'm going to do it and
 of course it's not going to be as good as the airplane down the line theiterative things that happen later on
 but um just being able to go to dream something into existence that youhaven't seen before and then
 make it happen like takes an unbelievable like strength of characteralmost like a force of will
 because you have you're you're blazing a trail that hasn't beenwalked before that's the bj pen factor
 in you know winning the jiu jitsu world championshipfirst non-brazilian to do that was back
 in 2001 and then raphael lovato later on it'slike he's you know both of those guys
 are so unbelievably impressive in my mind for the same reason you knowbecause they were
 out there winning at a time when that wasn't a common thing not that it's easyto win now it's just
 there's not a psychological hurdle that needs to be left i remember you knowwhen i was early in jiu jitsu like
 americans weren't winning the world championships at any belt i meanbj we all knew bj penn because bj penned
 it but it was really really uncommon now it happensyou know on a semi-regular basis of
 course the brazilians are so strong europeans are still strongbut uh and australians are coming on as
 well but uh it's it's definitely kind of aninteresting thing so to come back to
 you know john danaher and the uh hensar team obviously they're doingfantastic things john's had some really
 really great innovation there and the the the systematization and themethodology
 that they're using is uh is great and it's neat to see that it's getting outthere
 um i would just also what i would encourage people tomake sure that they're you know catching
 up on their history because obviously you know john's a brilliant instructorand
 has done things you know for the sport that um that are fantastic that haven'tbeen done before but you know none of us
 exist in a vacuum and i've learned things from everywhere else so you knowjohn would say the same i'm sure
 and uh you know dean lister would say the same and it's just neat when you cankind of trace the history of all of this
 happening because we've had humanity's had two arms and two legs forsome time at least as long as i've been
 alive but you mentioned like

2:49:06
Speaker 1 :airplanes do you think there's something
 totally new to be invented in jiu jitsu still not totally new but like theyou know flying isn't new right uh but
 airplanes nevertheless made that much more efficient is there like new ideasto be discovered in digital still i'd
 say the reason i'd say yes is the same

2:49:23
Speaker 0 :reason i would say i believe in alchemy
 even though i don't i'm serious like i've got some backing for this okayum you know i guess i talk about this
 with a buddy of mine a lot like uh and facilitative versus not facilitatedbeliefs
 and if i don't believe something is possible and i do no investigationtowards it
 i'll never find something even if it's there it's almost like it's no differentthan me walking up on a group of people
 and going like oh man look at these jerks this is going to suckversus me going i wonder what these guys
 are up to i'm about to have two very different conversations even though theplayers in the game are no different my
 internal constitution has changed becauseof of how i've decided to approach the
 situation so although i wouldn't personally want to spend all my timetrying to turn lead into gold because i
 don't believe that it's likely to work only a person who's willing to spend hisor her life in that pursuit will
 actually get to the bottom of that and also in thein the pursuit of that they're likely to
 find other things so i think a lot of times the idea is that humanity ispushed forward by
 you know again it's another orson scott carbon it's like you know human beingsare in this slog it's
 paraphrasing just in this slog over time and then periodicallythe humanity gives birth to genius like
 someone that invents the wheel invents electricity pushes us forwardyou know comes up with with the idea of
 governance that doesn't you know just start and end with the point of a swordyou know and uh you know these aren't
 common things these are unbelievable advancements that you know that just mesitting here i didn't come up with them
 but i just get the benefit of it so i guess what i would say is a lot oftimes these ideas are called crazy
 you know like as we discussed on kind of offline it's like you know einsteinwas brilliant in his 20s and it was
 brilliant before that i would suspect but basically uh you know getsrecognized later on in life and
 of course we all thought those were great ideas the man was probably roundlymocked for
 giant chunks of his life and i i guess so it's neati would say there's definitely in my
 mind things that even if it's just combinations and new to menew ways to see things new ways to
 understand different depth of understanding possibly new things newpositions new ideas
 because even if that's not true the process of of going through andacting as if it is and believing like
 that and focusing and trying to investigate will make any ofus will push us all forward
 we're sitting there you know obsessing over the cult of our current knowledgei think is the biggest the biggest
 danger um and the biggest cause of stagnation thatexists anywhere


2:51:45
Speaker 1 :yeah and it starts with believing the
 the impossible which is kind of interestingone of the things that's really
 inspiring to me is to see people out there whichwhich sadly are rare who kind of have


2:51:57
Speaker 0 :

2:51:58
Speaker 1 :uh a combination of two things one
 is they have a world view that involves that includes a lot of ideas that arecrazy and
 the second part is they're exceptionally focused and competent in bringing thatwhatever the ideas in that world view to
 reality so there's certainly a lot of people withcrazy ideas you know there's a lot of
 conspiracy theorists they have way out their beliefs about things butthey're not
 doing much to like make the like build stuffgrounded and like they're not engineers
 or whatever they're just like espousing different crazy ideas butthat's why you get like the elon musk
 type characters and the reason i bring him up a lotis because like there's not many others
 to bring up it's like there's not many examples of it throughhistory the people
 i mean the guy's convinced that we're going to colonize marsand basically
 everybody on earth thinks that's insane everyone accept the guy that's going to

2:52:57
Speaker 0 :do it right except that's going to do it


2:52:59
Speaker 1 :and like
 you can imagine like a couple hundred years from nowpeople will i mean
 first of all they won't certainly won't remember the hatersthey won't remember all the people if if
 they do remember them they'll remember them in a sense likepeople were silly to think that this
 isn't the obvious path forward like from a perspectivethat's what that's what
 elon talks about like it's obvious that we're going to expand throughout theuniverse
 like so from his perspective from his

2:53:30
Speaker 0 :

2:53:31
Speaker 1 :perspective like
 but to me it is also obvious because like either we destroy ourselvesor will expand beyond earth like
 uh like there's not many you know we well it's not maybe it's not completelyobvious i'm i guess i share that world
 view there's the other possibility that wehumans find a sort of
 an inner peace where the forces of capitalism will calm downand we'll all just meditate and do yoga
 and jiu jitsu and like relax with this whole tech thingwhere we keep building new technologies
 but it's cool to have those kinds of peoplethat just believe the big ambitious
 crazy dreams because that's where it starts if youwant to build something special you have
 to first believe that when you also have to believe

2:54:16
Speaker 0 :strongly enough that you're not
 vulnerable and i'm speculating but it's like i can only imagine how many peoplehave told
 elon that what he's doing is crazy so not only did he dream it up he dreamedit up
 went with it and also went with it in the face of beingtold that it's not going to work and
 then time and then also stepped away from the bitterness becausehe's done a series of really crazy
 impressive things uh and that's only those little thingsi'm aware of but and also staying away
 from the bitterness of every single time you did something good initially iall i do is talk down about you and then
 eventually i act as of course of course i never apologizeand yet you don't let that dampen
 your spirits for the next innovation which is pretty incredible to me towatch
 yeah it's kind of cool i mean uh it's

2:54:58
Speaker 1 :contagious to spend time
 with the guy because he's not it's rogan has the same look to him which isinteresting about these people
 is uh like there there's like a hater shieldthat he's like he doesn't even like
 sense them it feels like like it doesn't he does he thinks to uhto elon it's like it's obvious
 i mean he keeps calling it like first principles thinkinglike physics says it's true therefore
 it's true like he's convinced himself that likehis beliefs are grounded in the
 fundamental fabric of the way the universe workstherefore the haters don't matter right
 and i mean that's kind of like a system of thought he developed himselfthrough all the difficulty through all
 the doubt he's able to take huge risks withbasically putting everything he owes on
 the line multiple times throughout his lifeamidst all the drama amidst all the
 doubts amidst all like the he's still able to make just clearclear-headed decisions
 it's i don't know what to make of it but it's inspiring as hell well

2:56:01
Speaker 0 :it's i think it's something that's funny
 i think like i can only imagine that you know history will look back on himas a brilliant person but that's not the
 only there's there's a lot of maybe not notstatistically speaking but a lot
 numerically on a giant planet of you know billions peoplea lot of brilliant people well um you
 know time place luck fortune all that other stuff but at thesame time that clearly isn't the only
 determining thing in making elon musk musk and obviously i don't know the guyfrom adam and
 but it's an interesting thing that it's not just his intellect his belief systemhis structure
 how he's viewing the world like that's did hereason his way to that did he not what
 other factors came in i'm really curious about that because i guess coming it'sagain i feel really strongly about
 people's belief structure and and this the how they view the worldbeing more important than the engine
 behind it you know it makes someone resilient ornot it makes someone
 positive or not because you could have ten thousand i think about this forcompetitive stuff
 you could have ten thousand things going properly and one thing going improperlyif you focus on the improper you'll
 probably fix it at a certain point which is goodfacilitated for development in the long
 term but if you had to go and try to perform a task in the next five minutesand you're focusing on the negative your
 confidence and your your your belief in in the positive outcome of the future islikely to be damaged
 whereas you could have 25 things going wrong but you go man i sure am happy tobe alive how fortunate i am this is
 great i can't this is i have problems to solve this is awesomeversus i list the problems and i start
 bitching about them both of them are technically accuratebut it's i guess different lenses and i
 think that's a really neat thing to see you know someone you know exemplifyingthat for us


2:57:39
Speaker 1 :so maybe to look at the the fighting
 world there's a million questions i can askhere like one you mentioned bj penn
 you uh first of all you are undefeated in the ufc andone of the fights you've had is against
 bj penn which is a kind of an incredible fight you you wonperformance of the night
 what did it feel like to uh to face pj pen and to beat himdefinitively as he did
 like what's that whole experience like

2:58:09
Speaker 0 :i'll be honest i didn't know
 if i was going to ever be able to fight again after beating gray maynard in 2016um and i've had a couple of periods of
 those i i was about to join the army actually in uhwhen i was 30 before the uh for the ufc
 for jen sent me over to ultimate fighter ididn't want to go because i was like one
 they're never going to pick me too i'd be terrible for tvthree i'll probably say something i'm
 gonna get you know burned to death in the streetsyou know i'm like this isn't a great
 idea and then uh she said well go out there see what happens do it anywayyou'll be
 you'll regret it if you didn't and then i ended up doing ultimate fighter andthen
 so i fought three times on the show and then i fought umfor the for the finale so those four
 times in like five or six months which was great andthen it took me a year to get another
 opponent um and that was gray maynard and thengray was obviously a very tough guy
 managed to get a good outcome there then it took two years to fight b.j penn andthat was
 you know obviously i'm training all the time every single day and that neverstops but that was i'll be honest like
 pretty deeply frustrating because you know asa human being as an athlete you know i
 think as an athlete you die twice like you have an athleticpeak or area and then then you go on
 with the rest of your life but it is a microcosm for the rest ofyour life it's like you're seeing this
 the sand tick away in the hourglass or drop away and you're going man this isthese are years between 31 32 33 like
 i'll be at my best at this time my absolutebest physically now not technically i'm
 a lot better now than i was before and i planned butat a certain point you will
 unless you're bernard hopkins you will reach diminishing returns andi guess that's the long the long wait


2:59:40
Speaker 1 :you can feel the clock
 ticking is this frustrating so why why did it take two years for bj

2:59:47
Speaker 0 :i uh i i that's the question people ask


2:59:49
Speaker 1 :a lot like
 why does nobody want to fight right now i don't know i probably they probably

2:59:53
Speaker 0 :think they'll get infected by whatever
 this is but uh i don't i don't blame them but uh i mean you'rea really tough opponent is the bottom


2:59:59
Speaker 1 :line


3:00:01
Speaker 0 :i'll say that i'm different maybe they
 perceive that the uh the the threat is greater than the reward i'mhoping that now that we're ranked number
 12 you know in the ufc rankings that uhthat that will change and i know that if
 we're one more win and then we're in the top10 that you know now
 now you're there but uh what i've consistently found is that like randomswant to fight and i'm like go away
 you know i didn't come here for you you know because if i wanted to just fightanybody i could go down to a waffle
 house and yell until like dmx shows up and we can we can fight because he'll beat the waffle house too who am i kidding
 i really want to hang out with the mx but uh you know it's like you want towhen i had the opportunity
 dmx oh my god that was i would never flick shows i would never fightdmx we'd be on the same team no
 but uh anyway um it's i i guess um i i accepted fights against uh i askedthe guy to ask about llamas i said yes i
 got asked about dennis bermudez i said yes umyou know like long periods of time and
 they at that time you know in between 2016and 2018 um i was struggling to have
 have opponents who would sign up and uh us i haven't turned down fights i justsaid hey
 you know keep the i don't care about fighting the randoms andit's you have a successful school you're


3:01:10
Speaker 1 :like
 you're running you're a martial artist broadly speaking soit doesn't make sense to to take fights
 that aren't like right that fit a certain kind oftrajectory for your career and that's


3:01:23
Speaker 0 :when when bj penn they said well bj's
 looking for an opponent i was like i'm your guy and uh and i think that youknow bj accepted that fight because um
 another jiu-jitsu guy i don't think he perceived that i was much of a threaton the feet
 um and uh you know i was able to it was neat to get it to compete againstsomeone
 uh you know who's one of my heroes one of the people i looked up to in mma forthe longest time and you intimidated by
 that no no i love competing i i don't reallyget nervous or scared before fights i'm
 not afraid to get hurt and not afraid to win i'm not afraid to lose it'si i'm just excited for the i feel
 thankful for the opportunity to compete and the opportunity toto play when it matters you know i i
 just but that's the only time i'm interested in playing anymore is when itwhen it matters when the opposition
 is i know that you know it's funny because people pick on ona lot of some opponents particularly
 after after the fact like if you if you get a good outcome well then uh ofcourse lex beat that guy that guy wasn't
 that good i'm like well i was that's after the fact i get to say thatand also as the person in the ring you
 know bj penn has hurt a lot of people in in in mixedmartial arts cage
 and i could actually absolutely have been on that listum so it was neat to get to compete
 against someone that i really respect someone that i looked up to for a longtime
 someone who has a great skill set and also i went up and wait to fight him athis weight class he didn't have to come
 down to mine which is where he'd take lightly it was lightweight yeah um igenerally have featherweight i walk
 around like 158 pounds so um what's the lightweight and

3:02:49
Speaker 1 :featherweight uh lightweight is 155.


3:02:50
Speaker 0 :with a day before weigh-in and
 featherweight is 145 with the day before weigh-in so i'm a little bit moreproperly sized for featherweight but um
 anyway uh you know i so i didn't feel likeobviously he was giving up
 a couple years of age but i was giving up size and all this other stuffand it was you know i was just excited
 to have the opportunity to step in against someone like bjand uh you know we managed to to get out
 of there with a with a good outcome without getting too banged upbut uh just it was cool because we tied
 up on the fence and just even uh the second you know is when you'rerolling with somebody and you touch and
 you can feel what they're doing you go oh man this guy's really good um you canfeel the calm you can feel the small
 minor adjustments that they're making the subtle things that they're doingand that was one of those things that
 was really neat and gratifying because you know you never know sometimes peoplethat you've heard of are a little bit
 less technically proficient than you thought and other times you'll meet someguys
 training like who the hell is this guy how have i not heard of this personand uh bj was exactly as a jitsu guy
 what i would have thought and uh another thing that's anotherthing that bugged me about how people
 reacted after the fight is uh you know basically going oh bjscrewed up this screwed up that i'm like
 all right yeah it's so interesting

3:03:58
Speaker 1 :that's sad
 that was you know one of the uh to me i mean as a fan of both that was abeautiful moment as uh
 as a as a kind of passing of a torch in a senseof exceptional performance like another
 one that stands out to me maybe you can commentis
 i don't understand well maybe i do why conor mcgregor gets as much hate as hedoes
 uh he probably revels in it but i think he doesn't get enough creditfor uh jose aldo
 for the for like for base you know knocking him out in the the inthe in the first few
 uh seconds of uh of a fight i mean uh jose is like one of thegreatest fighters ever
 that's true uh maybe some people could be even put in the top tenno question and the like i don't
 understand why it's doesn't get as muchlike conor mcgregor doesn't get as much
 credit uh as i think he deserves for that and for eddie alvarez and allthe fights
 for some reason whenever uh conor mcgregor beat somebodywell that they they were not that good
 then like it means like they were they werethere something was off right
 that's convenient isn't it yeah it's it's it's quite strange to mebut i mean what are your thoughts on the
 um on conor mcgregor maybe one way to ask that i'm russian some obviously alsokhabib fan
 but i'm also a conor fan it seems like there's not many of us who are like fansof both right


3:05:39
Speaker 0 :um what are your thoughts
 the two of us which also is a good play

3:05:42
Speaker 1 :uh
 uh stop dude yeah really really tough dudejust like five line which is really


3:05:48
Speaker 0 :interesting also the oh wow i didn't


3:05:51
Speaker 1 :know that side of it
 there's a brain there well on the khabib versus conor what do you make of theirfirst fight
 what do you do you agree with me that uh they should fight againbecause i think it would be awesome if
 they fought again in moscow and uh do you agree with me i'mjust gonna put
 say things that piss people off but i believe is that conor actually has achance to beat khabib one the conor


3:06:14
Speaker 0 :absolutely has a chance to be
 conor has a chance to beat anyone that he steps into that ring with and notjust like a mathematical chance you were
 like oh one of the billion but like you knowlike he absolutely it's funny because i
 i won't pretend to know conor really well but i first met conor in 2010 wheni was teaching a seminar
 in uh at straight blast jim ireland in dublin umand that's actually where i first met
 all of the coaches that ended up being onconor's team um you know john kavanagh
 owen roddy uh gunnar nelson you know so for i actuallyi enjoyed being on ultimate fighter and
 being on a uriah favors team and getting to train with all the guys there but atthe same time that the people that i was
 actually i knew better were actually the europeanside all the connors coaches
 um and uh that was a neat thing because i got toi met connor i didn't know who connor
 like connor wasn't conor at that point yeah that was beforehis ufc oh yeah well well before yeah i
 think i think he got in like 2014 maybe something like thatyeah and uh anyway but he was doing well
 in cage warriors winning the titles there i think prior to thatyou know i remember going seeing him on
 the show and uh also then getting to see him trainbecause i competed uh
 i was initially slated to fight david tamer for the ultimate fighter finalefor getting put into fight artem
 for the title for the show so i went over to ireland to train for a coupledays
 and basically it was neat to watch him watch him work i meanman is focused and trains a lot it's
 very very smart and very very hard working and i think alot of times people get stuck in the uh
 in this um you know and they almost want to believe that this waslucky or this this person
 you know they're not working that hard they're just out there they got therewith their mouth
 and that's that's just not the case and um you know i don't know what it's likeyou know obviously connor's very well
 off right now and i don't know how hard how serious he's training what he'sdoing i can't speak to any of that
 but uh there's no question that that he has skills to be dangerous and one ofthe funny things obviously the khabib
 fight one could be his weight could he was a great fighter andalso has the chance to beat anyone in
 that ring at any given time but uh there's there wasn't conor youknow
 it's uh one that he can he can put anybody away and as youmentioned i think that he doesn't get
 the credit for the eddie alvarez fight he doesn't get the credit for the josealdo fight because it was almost so much
 of a letdown i remember that happened the same weekend that i did the ultimatefighter finale
 and you're like all right wait what yeah it almost doesn't feel like a fighthappened but we mentioned miyamoto
 musashi i mean musashi was famous for the way he poked and prodded at peoplewith what he was doing whether overtly
 or not it's like oh we're supposed to fight to the death anduh you know at 3 p.m tomorrow great
 4pm rolls around i'm just not there five i mean you remember all the all theantics and nonsense that conor was
 pulling prior to that like speaking personally that's not it's notsomething i would feel comfortable doing
 but it's like everyone's different and the effect that it had on on josewas i mean beyond evidence when was the
 last time jose started the start of the fight withleaping left hand leaping right-hander
 like wait what and then he was obviously youknow
 living rent-free in jose's head at that point andthat was a combination of psychological
 you know ability and and and wherewithal and then physical andremind me of the way muhammad ali would
 would bother people and whatnot and the fact that he's a polarizing figureum i i think makes some people
 not give him his due and then at the same time sometimes certain fans may bego overboard but uh they remember the
 knee that ben asker and got knocked out with bymazdal i mean that was an amazing
 unbelievable thing but three inches to the right three inches to the left iguess whichever side his head
 wasn't could have been square but uh and that fight starts with ben askren ontop of you in the first five seconds
 well connor ran and threw a knee just like that at khabib and could begot right around it that could have
 easily gone the other way can you imagine what would have happened ifafter the after coming back from boxing
 after coming back from from the mayweather fight connor connorin the first ten seconds it's over and
 you're like he would yeah it would have been intolerable butbasically
 yeah like you know but see here's the

3:10:08
Speaker 1 :thing let me actually push back slightly
 uh i mean to the fans correct me if i'mwrong
 but conor seems to because i've competed a lot andlike there's a tension there's a
 negativity sometimes depending on the opponentand there's a respect afterwards that
 happens like when you understand that there's a deep like respect andalmost like love for each other
 like i always seen that in conor like all the trash talkafterwards yes there's a it's it's a
 subtle thing you can't always see it but there's arespect like i agree
 and the like that i almost on the khabib sidei almost feel like khabib really took it
 personally he did he didn't he lost the respect for connori thought the whole time conor had the
 respect so i what i wanted to say is likeif connor won that fight like rock
 khabib i could see like i wouldn't see trash talking i could seelike trash i can stop
 right there i think so too but at the

3:11:07
Speaker 0 :same time i'm sure you recall like
 connor come across in some pretty personal territoryyou know both religiously and also
 familiar with uh with khabib and it's you know i mean i think it's the sort ofthing that i don't know
 it's an interesting that's one of those sentences like you have to know the

3:11:23
Speaker 1 :difference so
 obviously i know the the the kibbe the dagestani people they don't playaround like that they don't play wrong
 like that you know you know i mean they take offense tobasically i mean you you don't do that
 so uh so like connor didn't maybe he did on purpose or maybe hewasn't even just aware of
 of uh it was cultural differences about

3:11:46
Speaker 0 :the box he opened


3:11:48
Speaker 1 :like you can talk to him if floyd
 mayweather you can you can go anywhere with him youcan you could say the most defensive
 things but with uh yeah that could be hardlineyeah hard lines but you uh i mean a lot
 of people ask i know you're a featherweight but if you were to

3:12:06
Speaker 0 :

3:12:07
Speaker 1 :uh face it feels like khabib is one of
 the hardest puzzles to solve in in all of mixed martial arts if youwere to face khabib
 do you think how would you go about solving that puzzlelike almost the question is almost from
 a jiu jitsu perspective too what do you do with a guy that'sexceptionally good at controlling
 position especially on top very good at wrestlingand taking down and controlling position
 like let's say so forget maybe striking on the ground how do you solvethat guy like what do you do with your
 guard if you get taken down or do you create an entire system of not gettingtaken down or escaping it's like what
 what ideas do you have for that well i

3:12:50
Speaker 0 :guess i would say in my mind fighting is
 a game of trading energy um kind of uh you know there's twothere's two things there's damage and
 there's energy so like when i say energy and being likeuh tired not tired how much how much gas
 you've got um and then damage counts obviously aswell um you could be feeling
 i could be feeling great and then you get to keep me in the head hard reallyhard three times it doesn't matter that
 i could get up and run a mile i can't get upso anyway um you know i think what
 khabib does is so well is he makes the fight look likeit could be the mega man fight
 um he does a great job of avoiding damage on the feet for the most partand really sucking the life out of
 people with how suffocating and oppressive is hiscontrol is his chain wrestling is as
 good as anyone we've ever seen in the ufc it's fantasticbut that poses a really serious threat
 for people that need to maintain a certain amount of spaceand try to hurt them on the feed because
 unless they're able to inflict an adequate amount of damagethey're gonna each time let's say for
 instance let's say him taking them down as a foregone conclusion at some pointum if every single time khabib takes you
 down you get right back up it's not that big a dealum because it's actually more we've all
 experienced this let's say you and i are rolling he tapped me 15 times in oneround who's more tired
 probably you are yeah you what my ass so badly that it's like you're the only oneworking
 but um so if you're comfortable with the

3:14:10
Speaker 1 :up and down of it like being taken down
 if you're if you don't if you don't get

3:14:14
Speaker 0 :hurt badly or tired on the bottom
 you have a chance but that doesn't involve just cracking him on the feetbefore he gets a hold of you
 that's a lot that's a lot to ask that's a lot to ask that's difficult to do it

3:14:27
Speaker 1 :seemed actually like
 conor it seemed like it when he was being kind of taken down or thethe takedown attempts against khabib he
 seemed to be somewhat relaxed the whole thing ithought he was doing well actually i


3:14:39
Speaker 0 :think that particularly for the first
 round i thought he did a very good job it's just one of thosethings that i think like uh
 could be being the fights taking place in khabib's worldin large part and i mean set aside that
 one giant uh what is it right hand that thatkhabib hit khanna with it by the way
 conor reacted like an absolute champion he gotcrushed by that overhand and then
 dropped and his eyes went right back on khabib it was immediategreat response so even though that was i
 think that was a bit of a surprising thing conor reacted really really wellbut if you're going to be on bottom
 with khabib for four rounds that's going to be tough and also conor's a waybetter grappler than people like to give
 him credit for but he's not the type of grappler thatcan do that can that can
 that's too tall of an order but there are grapplers that could do that or atleast would have a much much better shot
 at uh being able to weather that type of astorm do you see yourself being able to


3:15:27
Speaker 1 :be relaxed through that kind of storm
 yes well i guess

3:15:35
Speaker 0 :remember being being being savagely
 beaten is very relevant the time the timing of that answer was

3:15:41
Speaker 1 :like okay
 that's a dumb question no that's ultimately the goal of jiu jitsu is toum
 be relaxed to the fire for sure and

3:15:52
Speaker 0 :remember like every ufc fighter i win
 all hypothetical match ups yeah[Laughter]


3:15:58
Speaker 1 :that's true since uh
 i'm one to ask ridiculous questions and we've beentalking about sci-fi and all that kind
 of stuff let me ask the kind of big question that everybody disagrees aboutcertainly with me is uh who are the top
 five greatest mma fighters of all time oh man and umwhy is fedor number one okay well first


3:16:20
Speaker 0 :off fedor is number one
 oh really i agree right there with you really oh yeahtalk about people that just get
 completely underappreciated even though he's never been

3:16:28
Speaker 1 :like he's never succeeded in the ufc
 it's not his fault it came along after

3:16:31
Speaker 0 :him
 at the time that at the time that fedor was at his height the ufc wasnot where it was at for heavyweight
 fighting i mean not that there weren't good heavyweights there but fedorfedor was unbelievable you know i mean
 you remember i mean minotauro nogueira i was a massive fanof him i still remember watching uh
 what is it pride 2004 when when noguera fought crow cop and gotblasted with that left kick and dropped
 with like seconds left in the first round pride was great because at a10-minute first round in that
 five-minute second which again materially also alters thefight big time and you know just the
 texture of the fight because it's totally it's borderline a differentsport
 you know than than getting a five a pause and a fivebut anyway uh similar sports like one of
 those swimming things where they have nine gold medals for different types ofswimming right
 but still swimming but anyway uh um well yeah that they would disagree yeah

3:17:18
Speaker 1 :i don't know
 but it's so it's totally true ten ten minutes is different than five i'm sorryi think


3:17:25
Speaker 0 :don't don't don't drown me swimmers i
 don't swim very well it's easy easy to downplay it but anyway um uhyeah and then no better than uh jon


3:17:34
Speaker 1 :jones like the modern era
 well i mean i guess it's tough to

3:17:37
Speaker 0 :compete to compare across eras
 it would be like going and saying like oh man how how would such and such greatgrappler from today
 fare against someone from 1995 i'm like wellprobably pretty well for them depending
 upon who they are what's going on you knowthere's some people that would their
 skill sets might transition across eras but a lot of times not but that's notfair we get
 they'll be like comparing spartans to modern dayyou know like army guys they're like
 well who's gonna win i'm like well did modern day army guys get modern dayweapons well yeah
 but who's the toughest ruggedest group of people at the very leastso i guess it's tough to say but at
 least in my mind the people that i think about for great fighters theirtheir quality of opposition um their
 level of like lasting like success the level lasting innovation like thecourage that they have to demonstrate
 because again it's like being a big fish in a small pond takes no courage doesn'tmean that there's nothing there
 but it just requires something a little bit different so kazushi sakaraba is oneof my guys too
 uh bj penn also i mean bj penn fought leota machidayeah that's insane you know it's there
 was a time it was a different sport it was a different time in the sport whereyou know they were some guys were
 bouncing around doing different things but let'sso i guess the gracie family it's i mean
 they never had an in like obviously hoist was there um butthey never
 and that was a definitely a different sport weight classes being open thingslike that but you have to say the hoist


3:18:59
Speaker 1 :is up there oh no question one of the
 greatest ever

3:19:02
Speaker 0 :i think so too and again i wouldn't be
 sitting here talking to you um if it weren't for him so the graciefamily as a whole but i mean who's the
 better i mean i think the hoist would tell you himself probably that hixonwould have handled business back then
 but they didn't put him in so again he's the greatest fighter the greatestfighter the greatest fighter that we saw
 do his business so hoist up there for surewhat about so this is like nobody seems


3:19:22
Speaker 1 :to agree with me on this but like this
 connects to soccer again and messi it seems that people value likehow long you've been a champion how many
 like defenses of the championship that you'vehad successfully to me i highly value
 singular moments of genius so like like i i don't like if you look at conormcgregor he hasn't
 i guess held i've been a champion very long very muchhe didn't defend either title right he


3:19:52
Speaker 0 :didn't defend any other


3:19:54
Speaker 1 :either of the titles but like if you try
 and same with messi if you look at uh leonel messithere's just moments of brilliance
 unlike any other in history for both conor and messi and peopledon't seem to give credit it's like well
 how many world cups have you won but to me like why is it about thisarbitrary world
 cup thing or championship thing i think it's easier for people to wrap their

3:20:16
Speaker 0 :head around right it's like the nfl
 combine when was i mean yeah numbers it'ssomething well again if i go and if i
 pick tom brady in the first round you know and it works out they call me agenius if i
 pick tom brady in the first round after his combine and it doesn't work out iget fired and i'm never hired again i
 have to work work somewhere else but it's like i'minsulating myself from
 criticism i think almost if i go by the numbers well he had more bench pressesit's like how
 how many times have the guys that are like the super studs in the uhin the nfl combine ever been on the
 greatest players in the nfl history in nfl history likezero or close to zero and even if even
 if there's some it's certainly not a one to oneso it's so funny though i think it's
 just like how many how long how many days did he hold the title oh your titlereign was x times longer
 that means nothing so if we wanted to find greatest fighter ever like you saidi think individual moments of like
 you're like that was transcended that was differentthat was something else because people
 can win or lose for any number of different reasons and thatthat's an interesting thing again i
 don't blame argentina not winning the world cup on messiyou know that's not fair you know how
 many times has you know i mean aggies the i rememberwhen uh trent ilford was the quarterback
 for the uh the baltimore ravens and they had such astrong defense i'm not trying to pick on
 trent tilford but it's like they had such a strong defense that thatthey were like that was the ray lewis
 you know chris mcallister era you know and theythey won they won the super bowl
 i don't think anyone is going to say thatyou know trent dilfer is a better
 quarterback than you know or put him in the same category as dan marinobut he got the w he's got the he's got
 the super ring how many times uh let's use march madnessor super bowl i love it like that that
 guy always makes the finals but he just never gets it doneyeah so let me get this straight get
 into the finals nine times doesn't count because you didn't winthe end game i'm not saying it wouldn't
 be better but that guy won the game once he got over the hump well how many othertimes was in the finals
 zero you're like all right yeah it's

3:22:09
Speaker 1 :interesting well we
 yeah that we were obsessed with these numbers like umbecause we can't assess their method


3:22:16
Speaker 0 :right well i think most of the time most
 of us can't assess the method of anything and it's like oh look at thatguy do
 x y swimming i'm like how do i know michael phelps is great i don't knowwho's faster
 i can't look at his technique and say anything other than well that's waybetter than anything i know how to do
 but i can't say the difference between him and the nextguy so i guess that's
 i wonder if it's like i need a concrete identifier and a lot of times peopledon't like saying i don't know
 and most people won't put like a ronda

3:22:39
Speaker 1 :rousey in the top even
 20 or 50 of but like she changed more than more than almost anybody elseshe changed
 the martial arts history i i don't know if that even i i don'tthink i'm over exaggerating that she
 she made it okay for women to be fighters yeah and thatand like change the way we see like
 she's one of the great feminists of our time[Music]


3:23:09
Speaker 0 :in her own way yeah in in a weird kind


3:23:12
Speaker 1 :of way that like i don't know
 uh maybe i'm just a ronda rousey fan but theyeah but she's not in the conversation
 because then you start converting into numbers well how many did wellwas she is she among the greatest


3:23:23
Speaker 0 :fighters or did she do the greatest
 things you know i mean i don't i think it's something i mean obviouslyronda is a great judoka who was
 competing in mma at a time when a lot of the girls likewhere did you get your skills in the
 olympics where'd you get yours high school you're like yeah you're gonnaolympic girl is gonna beat you up but uh
 i i guess that that doesn't diminish it just thataccomplishment is what it is i don't
 have to i don't fedor is not diminished by thefact that
 he would like if he were to fight stephen milochus right now probablywouldn't go great
 or that jon jones exists i don't now have to like knock fedor'saccomplishments down
 or say oh because bj penn or someone so let's say hehas a mixed record at this point that
 somehow invalidates the things that they've done beforeyeah i guess it kind of brings us back
 to a lot of the other people we've talked about the fact that thethe brilliant people throughout history
 that we love are some of the monsters throughout history that werightly reviled in a lot of cases we're
 complicated people and their legacy is more than just one thing and someonedoing something amazing doesn't involve
 doesn't mean they didn't do anything bad and someone doing terrible thingsdoesn't doesn't mean that it doesn't
 invalidate the the positives that they did but i guess wefighting the urge to put people in one
 category and same with ourselves i think that'swhy people get depressed oh i'm good
 right now oh i'm bad right now versus hey we're all at work in progress andwe're trying to do x number of things
 and legacy is a tough thing to figure outanyway and it's all speculative


3:24:42
Speaker 1 :last time or no on reddit you said that
 last time too that you don't experience much fear uhbefore
 fights i'd like to ask you a couple mike tyson things if it's okay it's justinteresting to me
 i'm just weird so there's a i don't know if you've seen this clipof tyson talking about how he feels
 leading up to a fight that uh he's kind ofovertaken with fear as he gets closer
 and closer and closer to the ring his uh confidence grows umhave you seen the clip i'm aware of it


3:25:16
Speaker 0 :okay we've seen in a while here let me


3:25:18
Speaker 1 :play it for you i think george st peter


3:25:19
Speaker 0 :said something similar to me one time
 while i'm in the dressing room five minutes before i come outmy gloves are laced up i'm breaking my
 gloves down i'm pushing the lever at the back of mybreak in the middle of the blood so my
 knuckle appears to the left feel my knucklepiercing against the tight leather
 gloves on that and the last box angle and i come out ihave supreme confidence but i'm scared
 to death i'm totally afraid i'm afraid ofeverything i'm afraid of
 i'm afraid of being humiliated but i'm totally confident closer i get to thering the more confidence i get
 the closer more confidence i get the closer more confidence i getall during my training i've been afraid
 of this man i thought this man might be capable of beating mei've dreamed of him beating me but i
 always stayed afraid of him but it was closer i get to remain more confidentonce i'm
 in the ring i'm a god no one could beat me i'm a god

3:26:10
Speaker 1 :i mean first of all he's cognizant
 of both his demons and whatever the hell ideas he has about violence is sointeresting
 is there something about the uh the tension that he's describingabout being confident and scared that
 resonates with you or you're or do you hold to this ideathat you've kind of
 spoken about before that you're really not afraid no i

3:26:34
Speaker 0 :i can i can appreciate what he's saying
 you know i think that um you know i can speak to feeling likeconcerned about let's say for instance
 if you feel a certain way i think peopleare a lot more like computers than we
 than we like to admit and just because a lot of times i can't parsewhat's going on and why it doesn't mean
 that it's not it doesn't make sense and and i thinkthat at least in the times of like if
 i'm concerned about a situation or about a personor about something happening prior to
 the fight or i'm like there's a reason there was a reason i don't have to pushthat down and bury it there's a reason
 like why what have i not thought about what have i not donewhat am i missing why am i feeling this
 way as you mentioned you know for yourself prior like you'dbe like why am i feeling like this i
 don't do this very well in certain aspects of my lifenow that i mentioned it or not i think
 about it but when it comes to competing i think i do an all right joband i'm trying to learn to be better and
 it's uh and going like well why do i if i feelthis way there's a reason
 okay am i thinking about this the wrong way have i not adequately prepared forsomething i have to i
 have to address it and then maybe i'll be up for four hours that night you knowlike extra hours thinking what if i not
 address watching sparring watching this watching thatand then that when i when i
 am thinking about things more more accurately or when i've addressed whatthat concern was
 i feel any of that concern kind of dissipate andi guess if i honestly thought that
 you know i guess when it comes to i know i'm gonna die at a certain pointobviously i'm gonna get hurt
 i mean you know pain happens but the pain ofloss would be nothing compared to the or
 the pain of injury nothing compared to the painof running away you know and yeah and
 so i guess if i think about where's my value what it's likei feel like i'm a winner every single
 time i step into that ring and fight with everything that i have i can'tpromise that i'll win
 my next fight i know that i have the skills and the tools to beat anyonein grappling or wearing mixed martial
 arts at this point it's just i i know that for certain i've trainedenough people i compete with enough
 people i know i know where i stand but i also knowthat i'm not perfect and also the
 the better fighter even if i perceive that i was that thingum doesn't win on the night the the man
 who fights better wins on the night and if i give credencein my mind to
 only the person that's that's one has value versus going what's your processwhat's your path through this how are
 you going about this how are you thinking about this how are you behavingthen if if i can focus on the process
 then then i will respect my opponent i will respectmyself and i'll respect anyone
 that behaves with with a certain level of of consistency to thatand they could win there's plenty of
 winners in history that that are  bags and there's plenty of losersthat are not but
 winning doesn't make you a bad or good person and losing doesn't make you goodby default either
 or bad by default so and i think that that can be the truth socially that canbe the truth you know athletically and
 you know academically so i guess is

3:29:32
Speaker 1 :there a primal fear though like a primal
 fear of getting hurt the running away and not facingthe the threat long term is the bigger
 pain than any pain you can experience in thefight
 that's pretty powerful but what about the violence of i mean you don't havethat on your face but like
 the i don't know if you've also seen tyson talk about he was on roganrecently he was talking about
 was trying to psychoanalyze himself aboutwhy he enjoys violence
 so much i mean he called it orgasmic i don't know have you seen that clip ihaven't okay we're playing
 we're playing it because i can i need to because trump also retweeted it which ishilarious i don't know how to
 contextualize yeah that's something that our president

3:30:23
Speaker 0 :

3:30:24
Speaker 1 :retweeted the clip of uh
 of tyson saying that's just maybe he's just doing like they're not

3:30:30
Speaker 0 :it's like i'm gonna throw him a
 curveball no one's gonna have any idea what that is but yeah he did no

3:30:35
Speaker 1 :explanation just here you go there you
 go well i think that's kind of like what

3:30:38
Speaker 0 :you're describing it's like if i give
 you an answer it has to be a good one better to just let your imagination runexactly


3:30:45
Speaker 1 :yeah he's yeah he's like the kubrick of
 our time

3:30:49
Speaker 0 :you know what's really interesting that
 sometimes um period it's not real but sometimes istruggle with the fact of why it's a
 possibility i can really hurt somebody like you don't want to hurt themwhat do you mean when you struggle
 struggle with the possibility that you could hurt themthat is sometimes it's orgasmic
 sometimes yeah like some fights like particularlylike
 tyro biggs or someone that you had problems withsomeone that you joe's not getting you
 had animosity towards so when you finally get your hands onthem hey um
 what does it mean um when fighting gets gets you erect what does that mean it'sa good question
 means you're getting excited yeah so that that's going through your mindright now well that's how i get when i
 was a kid and i you know sometimes i get to twinkle the twinkle yeah wellthat's what i'm saying is like you
 reached a state as a human being as a champion as a ferocious fighteryou reached a state of of ability
 and of accomplishment that very few humans will ever evertouch and feel that's why i'm asking you
 when you're running when you're hitting the bag when thatheart's beating again and that you know
 who you are you're mike tyson so whenyou're doing all this again you're
 still mike tyson those thoughts have got to be burninginside you again
 it's got to be pretty wild i don't know it's um it's wild but umi believe it's um it's rightfully so to
 be that way and i just know how to um i don't but think i i'm how to dealwith it
 i don't let it overwhelm me i mean he

3:32:39
Speaker 1 :goes on to try to
 they don't ever like joe doesn't bite well the interesting thing aboutthat
 conversation is mike was trying to figure himself outyeah like he's trying on the spot like
 why do i feel this way uh to me it was like to me it's so realand honest to uh to feel
 like pleasure from hurting somebody like that you rarely hear thatin this society it's like you rarely
 like talk about like you feel pleasure from winningyou feel pleasure from like the relief
 of overcoming like all the stress you have to go throughpleasure from just like the
 the specifics of the fight the techniques you use themaybe overcoming being down a couple
 rounds but like how often do you hear somebody sayi just enjoyed he's not even saying
 because i hate the opponent he's saying likei enjoyed purely the violence of it
 that's crazy i mean i don't know it's honest

3:33:56
Speaker 0 :

3:33:56
Speaker 1 :it made me ask like i wonder how many of
 us are cognizant of that

3:34:01
Speaker 0 :let's say mike is uncommonly
 seemingly uh honest i think athletes make a full-time job out of lyingyou know i think people make a full
 themselves perhaps too that's fair i mean in some you tell yourself or youtell others what you feel you need to or
 maybe whether you would even know what you feel you needto but why should he not
 i mean again did he did he run up and just hit somebody that'sdidn't sign up for this no they sign it
 to be there

3:34:29
Speaker 1 :well that's the interesting thing about
 dyson is there's that weird uh like non-standard behavior i meanlike your fighting style is not standard
 he's non-standard to another degree of like uh who else has that in jiujitsu uh
 uh polaris uh uh has this kind of weirdness like what's what's in therelike there's a fear that i think uh
 most opponents would have because it's like it's no longer aboutlike it takes you out of the realm of
 its game it takes us back to the thing we'retalking about like before is
 it strips away that like several layers ofryan hall the the podcast uh guest
 ryan hall the jiu jitsu instructor ryan hall just a competitorit keeps going down to a point where
 like ryan hall the murderer of all things that get in his waythat lies underneath all of it seemingly
 like if we're like in this society we put all thataside but it makes you wonder
 like now society's being tested in many ways it makes you wonder likewhat's underneath there well do we want


3:35:40
Speaker 0 :do we want the answer to that because i
 guess it's what is it uh you've seen paul fiction you know thebest character in the movie and in the
 best scene in the movies i give my questions here if you're what he calledhim my answers scare you she's asking
 scary questions you know and i guess uh you wonder imean all of us that's something that i
 think it's funny oh that's not okay i mean versus maybenot appropriate
 for situation x y or z but uh what should make any of us think i meanhumanity is a different place now and i
 mean i'm not saying anything crazy out there but it came in adifferent place now than we were 5 000
 years ago where all of us are descended frompeople who have killed things with their
 teeth and fingernails in order to be where we areand whether it was in whether it was an
 animal or it was in conflict with another personi mean think about that the chances of
 dying by violence now are so so slim at least in in most countries inmost places like shockingly small
 thankfully but there was a period of time like the mostperiod of time where dying by violence
 was mostly how it went down and i guess what would be facilitativewhat would allow you to win
 back to ender's game you know what allows youif you can't do that you are all you are
 forever subject to people who can and that's that's a real thing andyou know we're fortunate to find
 ourselves in a situation where we don't where other things matter but that is afunny thing periodically where people
 you'll see people like kind of drawing at each other likein videos or out in the world
 that clearly neither of them expect this to get serious like i'm just going toyell at you you're going to yell at me
 and it's like this weird larping thing we're both going to go on our ownseparate way
 all it takes is one person to be like well i wasn't kidding yeah and it's likeoh you'll go to jail like oh
 i know you're gonna go to the morgue and it'sthat's but that can happen like that
 like society i mean obviously anyway you could jump across the table and stab mein the eye
 i mean i appreciate hope if you don't and there will be consequences if you dobut not from not from me
 from from the rest of society will potentially get you at a certain pointbut you can decide to not play by the
 rules anytime you want it's fascinating that yeah that's we've

3:37:40
Speaker 1 :created rules
 based on which we all behave but underneath thereyou know there there's things that
 doesn't the there's motivations and forces that don't play by the rulesthey're still there nature's metal is
 under the surface seriously and again i pull out my phone

3:37:56
Speaker 0 :and i'm basically saying like hey
 i'm gonna you're gonna get caught yeah but really i'm further antagonizing youyeah
 rightly wrongly you know what i mean like and that that's an interestingthing and i feel like just people need
 to remember any of us need to remember just for any reason justthat's that's one step away at all at
 all times you ever i've had people say to me before like oh i don't feel safei'm like you're not safe
 i'll kill you before you get out of this room nothing you do stop that nothingi mean but don't worry you could do the
 same to me which means i'm like oh thank goodness can you imagine like how manyguns are there are in this country
 like i mean everywhere i mean seriously everywhere but that's a hearteningthought not the other way because people
 usually freak out and go oh my god gun violence gun violence says gun violenceis
 like really not a serious issue in the united states compared to what it couldbe
 because it means that i mean with the amount of guns and the amount ofbullets that are out there that are in
 circulation can you imagine if like one in every thousand was used in angereach day i mean
 this would be a terrifying place to live you couldn't go anywhere so i meanalthough you could say hey this is more
 than we'd like or xyz it actually means that people are muchmore reasonable insane than we're saying
 than or then i then sometimes i might and i might argue so i guess what i meanis like oh man i walked to 7-11
 and i didn't get stabbed i'm like oh well that's good because not because iprotected myself with my karate
 it's basically no one decided to run over and stab me because i wasn'tprotecting myself it's
 i they they stopped so i guess we're all fortunate to live in a society thatlike you said nature being metal doesn't
 become that big of an issue all the time but it is funny when you get people inthe ring and you go hey let's peel back
 from mr tyson many layers of that and say hey now it's okay and it's cool

3:39:35
Speaker 1 :that i mean that's what society's doing
 so i've i lived in harvard square for a whileand we
 add extra layers of what safe means like now there's a dis discourse about safespaces about like
 ideas being violence or or like uh you know yeah but ideas orminor slights against your personality
 being violence but that's all like extra layers aroundthe nature is metal thing
 that uh it's cool that's that's what progress is but we can't forget thatlike underneath it it's still
 it's still the the thing that will murder at the at the drop of uhin any at any moment if uh if aroused
 one thing that i find funny though or

3:40:20
Speaker 0 :ironic maybe about the uh
 the you know words of violence you know offense is violence thing is that ofcourse
 that if that the belief in that then justifiesmy violence like my and whether maybe
 maybe not physical violence but my response to my my aggressive response tothings
 and i guess like which again regrets begets a further aggressive response andlike a you know kind of a
 tit-for-tat sort of situation or or it goes to like well there's 10 of me andthere's one of you so we'll get you and
 you can't do anything about it but that's not morality that's that'sjust saying that's might makes right
 so i guess again you can understand why people do it and there are certain thereis a progress aspect to it but again i
 guess without proper examination i'm effectivelywith my 10 friends you know and and the
 force of the law mike tysoning people but not admitting to myself what i'mdoing and at least mike tyson again is
 honest

3:41:15
Speaker 1 :are you uh afraid of death
 i mean it's easy for me to say no as i

3:41:18
Speaker 0 :sit here probably not about to die but
 is this like the ufc question can you

3:41:22
Speaker 1 :defeat any opponent exactly


3:41:25
Speaker 0 :yes the answer is of course yes and uh i
 don't have they're not around they're not here are theyyeah exactly but i mean you uh do you


3:41:32
Speaker 1 :ponder your own mortality
 maybe another context to that is you mentioned two deathsfor martial artists i think that's
 actually why

3:41:40
Speaker 0 :honestly even though at a relatively
 young age i think mortality is something that i'm aware ofmore maybe more than the average person
 i think probably most athletes can speak to this andanyone that's had trouble i've managed
 to to slide out of a couple near-death experiences personally youknow mostly river related
 um because i'm an idiot but um i regret nothing but uh yeahyeah but uh thank god we're here but um
 yeah it is in our seeing seeing the end and seeing goingwell what's going to happen i guess i
 think it comes back to kind of what we'rediscussing about belief structure and
 belief system i think a lot of times if i recognizethat no matter what i do
 it's all going to end one day and then you go well why were we here what wouldi do
 am i going to make it to 40. i have no idea i'd like to hope sothat i had no idea that i was going to
 make it to to the age that i am now um am i going to make it to 80. how muchof that is in my control
 much of it is not i mean it's so funny it's an interesting like back to thebelief structure again like locus of
 internal and external locus of control you know what's facilitative versuswhat's true
 and you know i think accepting personal responsibility for more than is on mycontrol
 is is probably a positive but at the same time recognizingthat much of much is not in my control i
 was fortunate enough to be born in the united states fortunateenough to you know to not
 knock on wood have a serious disease that i'm not aware of right nowum i didn't do any of that i just showed
 up that was really fortunate and i i guessthat doesn't diminish
 the fact that i try to make decent choicesbut it works in concert with it and i i
 guess um when i when you go is death what i wantright now no no i should think not and
 again it's easy for me to be relatively calm about as i'm not staring it in theface
 but what i would care a lot more about isis how you live that's what's in my
 control and i can't control if as i walk out of this building a helicopter fallson me
 worrying about that i can't control maybe i maybe i have cancer now and idon't know it
 i really hope not but um there's something about meditating on the fact

3:43:49
Speaker 1 :that
 it could end today outside your control that can uh clarify your thinking aboutyeah the the fact that life is amazing
 like just kind of somebody yeah helping you enjoy thismoment even if life was horrible


3:44:02
Speaker 0 :let's say for instance it was it was you
 live at one of those times or places and this placestill exists in this world today that
 life is brutal and metal and whatever all and short andpainful
 would you still want it and again as i'm sitting here notnot on fire physically it's easy to say
 yes but i would i'm confident i still i'll plant my feet and say yes any oflife any life is amazing and beautiful
 and a gift an unbelievable gift that none ofus have earned
 for the record i hate the word earned a lot of times earn yeah you earn but it'slike
 there's a lot a lot of good fortune in earning and that's back to do i wantjustice or do i want
 grace and i guess we're all fortunate to be where we are no matter where we areand hopefully it should give us
 some sense of perspective some sense of compassion for other people but alsolike like you said a sense of peace if
 it all ended right now would i be happy with what i with a life to thispoint of course
 would you like to live a little longer yeah i would try to do moreand try to live rightly to the best that
 i know how which over time will hopefully continue to evolve in apositive direction
 but if the answer to that is no i i guess uh that's that's alwaysthat's a sign that that what i'm doing
 is not what i'm meant to be doing and i mean you're familiar with the tecumsehbefore so there's a i've got one
 actually if you could give me 10 seconds i'll i'll read this one out this isa personal favorite basically and i
 think it sums up i mean again like it's one of those quotes on the internet likewhen abraham lincoln said don't believe
 everything you read online um but uh this is you know i it'sagain uh attributed but it's like so
 live your life that the fear of death can never enter yourheart trouble knowing about their
 religion respect others in their view and demand that they respect yourslove your life perfect your life
 beautify all things in your life seek to make your life long and itspurpose in the service of your people
 prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great dividealways give a word or sign a salute when
 meeting or passing a friend even a stranger when when in a lonely placeshow respect to all people and grovel to
 none when you arise in the morning givethanks for the food and for the joy of
 living if you see no reason for giving thanksthe fault lies only in yourself
 abuse no one and no thing for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robsthe spirit of its vision
 when it comes your time to die be not like those whose hearts are filled withthe fear of death
 so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to livetheir lives over again in a different
 way sing your death song and die like a herogoing home
 powerful words i don't think there's a

3:46:33
Speaker 1 :better way to end it let me just say
 uh we've spoke maybe five six years ago i don't even remember when but i'm notexaggerating
 saying like you had a huge impact on my life because of the podcastyou're the reason i was doing the
 podcast as long as i have you're the reason i'mdoing this podcast
 and it's a little it's a stupid little meeting that you probably didn't knowwho i was
 i didn't really know who you are it was just like a magical moment it's a flapof a butterfly wing kind of situation
 and uh yeah i'm forever grateful you're one of themost inspiring people in my life so ryan
 it's a huge honor that you would come here uh jen and talk with me andwaste
