0:02:07
Speaker 0 :better world and now here's my


0:02:08
Speaker 1 :

0:02:09
Speaker 0 :with Jim Keller what are the differences


0:02:11
Speaker 1 :in similarities between the human brain
 and a computer with the microprocessors core let's start with a philosophical

0:02:20
Speaker 0 :question perhaps well since people don't
 actually understand how human brains work I think that's true I think that'strue so it's hard to compare them
 computers are you know there's really two things there's memory and there'scomputation right and to date almost all
 computer architectures are global memory which is a thing right and thencomputation where you pull data and you
 do relatively simple operations on it

0:02:53
Speaker 1 :and write data back so it's decoupled in
 modern in modern computers and you think in the human brain everything's a mesh amess that's combined together what


0:03:02
Speaker 0 :people observe is there's you know some
 number of layers of neurons which have local and global connections andinformation is stored in some
 distributed fashion and people build things called neural networks incomputers where the information is
 distributed in some kind of fashion you know there's a mathematics behind it Idon't know that the understandings that
 is super deep the computations we run on those are straightforward computations Idon't believe anybody has said a neuron
 does this computation so to date it's hard to compare them I would say so

0:03:44
Speaker 1 :let's get into the basics before we zoom
 back out how do you build a computer from scratch what is a microprocessorwhat is it microarchitecture what's an
 instruction set architecture maybe even as far back as what is a transistor so

0:03:59
Speaker 0 :the special charm of computer
 engineering is there's a relatively good understanding of abstraction layers sodown to bottom you have atoms and atoms
 get put together in materials like silicon or dope silicon or metal and webuild transistors on top of that we
 build logic gates right and in functional units like anadder or subtractor or an instruction
 parsing unit and we assemble those into you know processing elements moderncomputers are built out of you know
 probably 10 to 20 locally you know organic processing elements or coherentprocessing elements and then that runs
 computer programs right so there's abstraction layers and then software youknow there's an instruction set you run
 and then there's assembly language C C++ Java JavaScript you know there'sabstraction layers you know essentially
 from the atom to the data center right so when you when you build a computeryou know first there's a target like
 what's it for look how fast does it have to be which you know today there's awhole bunch of metrics about what that
 is and then in an organization of you know a thousand people who build acomputer there's lots of different
 disciplines that you have to operate on does that make sense and so so there's a

0:05:25
Speaker 1 :bunch of levels abstraction of in in
 organizational I can tell and in your own vision there's a lot of brilliancethat comes in it every one of those
 layers some of it is science some was engineering some of his art what's themost
 if you could pick favorites what's the most important your favorite layer onthese layers of abstractions where does


0:05:53
Speaker 0 :the magic enter this hierarchy I don't
 really care that's the fun you know I'm somewhat agnostic to that so I would sayfor relatively long periods of time
 instruction sets are stable so the x86 instruction said the arm instruction set

0:06:12
Speaker 1 :what's an instruction set so it says how


0:06:12
Speaker 0 :do you encode the basic operations load
 store multiply add subtract conditional branch you know there aren't that manyinteresting instructions look if you
 look at a program and it runs you know 90% of the execution is on 25 opcodesyou know 25 instructions on those are
 stable right what does it mean stable

0:06:33
Speaker 1 :

0:06:34
Speaker 0 :until architecture has been around for
 twenty-five years it works it works and that's because the basics you know ordefined a long time ago right now the
 way an old computer ran is you fetched instructions and you executed them inorder to the load do the ad do the
 compare the way a modern computer works is you fetch large numbers ofinstructions say 500 and then you find
 the dependency graph between the instructions and then you you execute inindependent units those little micro
 graphs so a modern computer like people like to say computers should be simpleand clean but it turns out the market
 for a simple complete clean slow computers is zero right we don't sellany simple clean computers now you can
 there's how you build it can be clean but the computer people want to buythat's say you know phone or data center
 such as a large number of instructions computes the dependency graph and thenexecutes it in a way that gets the right


0:07:49
Speaker 1 :answers and optimizes that graph somehow


0:07:50
Speaker 0 :yeah they run deeply out of order and
 then there's semantics around how memory ordering works and other things work sothe the computer sort of has a bunch of
 bookkeeping tables it says what order CDs operations finishing or appear tofinish him but to go fast you have to
 fetch a lot of instructions and find all the parallelism now there's a secondkind of computer which we call GPUs
 today and I called the difference there's found parallelism like you havea program with a lot of dependent
 instructions you fetch a bunch and then you go figure out the dependency graphand you issues instructions out order
 that's because you have one serial narrative to execute which in fact isand can be done out of order you call a
 narrative yeah well so yeah so humans think of serial narrative so read read abook right there's a you know there's
 the sends after sentence after sentence and there's paragraphsnow you could diagram that
 imagine you diagrammed it properly and you said which sentences could be readin anti order any order without changing
 the meaning right but that's a

0:08:59
Speaker 1 :fascinating question to ask of a book


0:09:02
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah you could do that right so
 some paragraphs could be reordered some sentences can be reordered you could sayhe is tall and smart and X right and it
 doesn't matter the order of tall and smart but if you say is that tall manwho's wearing a red shirt what colors
 you know like you can create dependencies right right and so GPUs onthe other hand run simple programs on
 pixels but you're given a million of them and the first order the screenyou're looking at it doesn't care which
 order you do it in so I call that given parallelism simple narratives around thelarge numbers of things where you can
 just say it's parallel because you told

0:09:52
Speaker 1 :me it was so found parallelism where the
 narrative is it's sequential but you discover like little pockets ofparallelism of versus turns out large


0:10:01
Speaker 0 :

0:10:03
Speaker 1 :pockets of parallelism large so how hard


0:10:05
Speaker 0 :is it to discuss well how hard is it
 that's just transistor count right so once you crack the problem you sayhere's how you fetch ten instructions at
 a time here's how you calculated the dependencies between them here's how youdescribe the dependencies here's you
 know these are pieces right so once you

0:10:21
Speaker 1 :describe the dependencies then it's just
 a graph sort of it's an algorithm that finds what is that I'm sure there's agraph there is the theoretical answer
 here that's solved well in general programs modern programs like humanbeings right
 how much found parallelism is there and on that I max what is 10 next mean oh

0:10:46
Speaker 0 :well you execute it in order vs. yeah


0:10:49
Speaker 1 :

0:10:50
Speaker 0 :you would get what's called cycles per
 instruction and it would be about you know three instructions three cycles perinstruction because of the latency of
 the operations and stuff and in a modern computer excuse it butlike point to 0.25 cycles per
 instruction so it's about with today fine 10x and there and there's twothings one is the found parallelism in
 the narrative right and the other is to predictability of the narrative right socertain operations they do a bunch of
 calculations and if greater than one do this else do that that that decision ispredicted in modern computers to high
 90% accuracy so branches happen a lot so imagine you have you have a decision tomake every six instructions which is
 about the average right but you want to fetch five under instructions figure outthe graph and execute them all in
 parallel that means you have let's say if you effect 600 instructions it'severy six you have to fetch you have to
 predict ninety-nine out of a hundred branches correctly for that window to be

0:12:01
Speaker 1 :effective okay so parallelism you can't
 paralyze branches or you can looking

0:12:07
Speaker 0 :

0:12:08
Speaker 1 :pretty you can what is predict a branch


0:12:10
Speaker 0 :mean or what open take so imagine you do
 a computation over and over you're in a loop so Wowand it's greater than one do and you go
 through that loop a million times so every time you look at the branch yousay it's probably still greater than one


0:12:24
Speaker 1 :he's saying you could do that accurately


0:12:27
Speaker 0 :very accurately monitoring comes my mind


0:12:29
Speaker 1 :is blown how the heck did you that wait
 a minute

0:12:32
Speaker 0 :well you want to know this is really sad
 20 years ago yes you simply recorded which way thebranch went last time and predicted the
 same thing right okay what's the

0:12:44
Speaker 1 :

0:12:45
Speaker 0 :accuracy of that 85% so then somebody
 said hey let's keep a couple of bits and have a little counter so and it predictsone way we count up and then pins so say
 you have a three bit counter so you count up and then count down and if it'syou know you can use the top bit as the
 sign bit so you have a sign to bit number so if it's greater than one youpredict taken and lesson one you predict
 not-taken right or less than zero or whatever thething is
 and that got us to 92% oh okay I know is this betterthis branch depends on how you got there
 so if you came down the code one way you're talking about Bob and Jane rightand then said is just Bob like Jane
 Enoch went one way but if you're talking about Bob and Jill this Bob like changesyou go a different way
 right so that's called history so you take the history and a counter that'scool but that's not how anything works
 today they use something that looks a little like a neural network so modernyou take all the execution flows and
 then you do basically deep pattern recognition of how the program isexecuting and you do that multiple
 different ways and you have something that chooses what the best result isthere's a little supercomputer inside
 the computer that's trying to project that calculates which way branches go sothe effective window that it's worth
 finding grassing gets bigger why was

0:14:18
Speaker 1 :that gonna make me sad that's amazing


0:14:22
Speaker 0 :it's amazingly complicated oh well
 here's the funny thing so to get to 85% took a thousand bits to get to 99% takestens of megabits
 so this is one of those to get the result you want you know to get from awindow of say 50 instructions to 500 it
 took three orders of magnitudes or four orders of magnitude toward bits now if

0:14:51
Speaker 1 :you get the prediction of a branch wrong
 what happens then what is the pipe you flush the pipes is just the performance

0:14:59
Speaker 0 :cost but it gets even better yeah so
 we're starting to look at stuff that says so executed down this path and thenyou had two ways to go but far far away
 there's something that doesn't matter which path you went so you miss you tookthe wrong path you executed a bunch of
 stuff then you had to miss predicting too backed it up but you remembered allthe results you already calculated some
 of those are just fine look if you read a book and youmisunderstand the paragraph your
 understanding is the next paragraph sometimes is invariance I don'tunderstand you sometimes it depends on


0:15:38
Speaker 1 :it and you can kind of anticipate that


0:15:42
Speaker 0 :invariance yeah well you can keep track
 of whether that data changed and so when you come back to a piece of code shouldyou calculate it again or do the same


0:15:51
Speaker 1 :thing okay how much does this is art and
 how much of it is science because it sounds pretty complicated so well how do

0:15:58
Speaker 0 :you describe a situation so imagine you
 come to a point in the road we have to make a decision right and you have abunch of knowledge about which way to go
 maybe you have a map so you want to go is the shortest way or do you want to gothe fastest way or you want to take the
 nicest Road so it's just some set of data so imagine you're doing somethingcomplicated like a building a computer
 and there's hundreds of decision points all with hundreds of possible ways to goand the ways you pick interacts in a
 complicated way right and then you have to pick the right spot right so thoseare there so I don't know yeah avoided


0:16:37
Speaker 1 :the question you just described do the
 Robert Frost poem road less taken I

0:16:43
Speaker 0 :describe the Robin truss problem which
 we do as computer designers it's all poetry ok greatyeah I don't know how to describe that
 because some people are very good at making those intuitive leaps it seemslike the combinations of things some
 people are less good at it but they're really good at evaluating youralternatives right and everybody has a
 different way to do it and some people can't make those sleeps but they'rereally good at analyzing it so when you
 see computers are designed by teams of people who have very different skillsets and a good team has lots of
 different kinds of people and I suspect you would describe some of them asartistic right but not very many


0:17:29
Speaker 1 :unfortunately or fortunately fortunately


0:17:32
Speaker 0 :well you know computer science hard it's
 99% perspiration and the 1% inspiration is really

0:17:43
Speaker 1 :important but I need the 99 yeah you got


0:17:45
Speaker 0 :to do a lot of work and then there's
 there are interesting things to do at every level that stack so at the end of

0:17:53
Speaker 1 :the day if you're on the same program
 multiple times does it always produce the same result is is there some roomfor fuzziness there that's a math


0:18:04
Speaker 0 :problem so if you run a correct C
 program the definition is every time you run it you get the same answer yeah that

0:18:12
Speaker 1 :well that's a math statement but that's


0:18:14
Speaker 0 :a that's a language definitional
 statement so yes for years when people did when we first did 3d acceleration ofgraphics you could run the same scene
 multiple times and get different answers right right and then some people thoughtthat was okay and some people thought it
 was a bad idea and then when the HPC world used GPUs for calculations theythought it's a really bad idea okay now
 in modern AI stuff people are looking at networks where the precision of the datais low enough that the date has somewhat
 noisy and the observation as the input data is unbelievably noisy so why shouldthe calculation be not noisy and people
 have experimented with algorithms that say can get faster answers by beingnoisy like as the network starts to
 converge if you look at the computation graph it starts out really wide and itgets narrower and you can say is that
 last little bit that important or should I start to graph on the next rap revbefore we would live all the way down to
 the answer right so you can create algorithms that are noisy now if you'redeveloping something and every time you
 run it you get a different answer it's really annoying and so most people thinkeven today every time you run the
 program you get the same answer now I

0:19:36
Speaker 1 :know but the question is that's the
 formal definition of a programming

0:19:41
Speaker 0 :language there is a definition of
 languages that don't get the same answer but people who use those you always wantsomething because you get a bad answer
 and then you're wondering is it because rightsomething in your brother because of
 this and so everybody wants a little swish that says no matter what ya do itdeterministically and it's really weird
 because almost everything going into monetary calculations is noisyso why the answers have to be so clear


0:20:08
Speaker 1 :it's right so where do you stand by


0:20:09
Speaker 0 :design computers for people who run
 programs so somebody says I want in deterministic answer like most peoplewant that can you deliver a


0:20:18
Speaker 1 :deterministic answer I guess is the
 question like when you hopefully sure

0:20:22
Speaker 0 :that's what people don't realize is you
 get a deterministic answer even though the execution flow is very owndeterministic so if you run this program
 a hundred times it never runs the same way twice ever and the answer it arises

0:20:36
Speaker 1 :

0:20:37
Speaker 0 :the same in but it gets the same answer


0:20:39
Speaker 1 :every time it's just just them is just
 amazing okay you've achieved in eyes of many people legend status as a cheap artarchitect what design creation are you
 most proud of perhaps because it was challengingbecause of its impact or because of the
 set of brilliant ideas that that were

0:21:06
Speaker 0 :involved in well I find that description
 odd and I has two small children and I promise you they think it's hilarious

0:21:16
Speaker 1 :

0:21:16
Speaker 0 :this question yeah so I dude so I I'm
 I'm really interested in building computers and I've worked with reallyreally smart people
 I'm not unbelievably smart I'm fascinated by how they go together bothas a as a thing to do and is endeavor
 that people do how people in computers

0:21:37
Speaker 1 :

0:21:40
Speaker 0 :go together yeah like how people think
 and build a computer and I find sometimes that the best computerarchitects aren't that interested in
 people or the best people managers aren't that good at designing computers

0:21:53
Speaker 1 :so the whole stack of human beings is
 fascinating so the managers individual

0:21:59
Speaker 0 :engineers yeah I just I said I realized
 after a lot of years of building computers where you sort of build themout of the transistors logic gates
 functional units come computational elements that you couldthink of people the same way so people
 are functional units yes and then you can think of organizational design it'sa computer architectural problem and
 then it's like oh that's super cool because the people are all differentjust like the computation elephants are
 all different and they like to do different things and and so I had a lotof fun like reframing how I think about


0:22:30
Speaker 1 :organizations just like with with
 computers we were saying execution paths you can have a lot of different pathsthat end up at a at at the same good
 destination so what have you learned about the human abstractions fromindividual functional human units to the
 broader organization what does it take

0:22:54
Speaker 0 :to create something special well most
 people don't think simple enough all right so do you know the differencebetween a recipe and understanding
 there's probably a philosophical description of this so imagine you canmake a loaf of bread yeah the recipe
 says get some flour add some water add some yeast mix it up let it rise put itin a pan put it in the oven it's a
 recipe right understanding bread you can understand biology supply chainsyou know grain grinders yeast physics
 you know thermodynamics like there's so many levels of understanding there andthen when people build and design things
 they frequently are executing some stack of recipes right and the problem withthat is the recipes all have a limited
 scope look if you have a really good recipe book for making bread it won'ttell you anything about how to make an
 omelet right right but if you have a deep understanding of cooking right thenbread omelets you know sandwich you know
 there's there's a different you know way of viewing everything and most peoplewhen you get to be an expert at
 something you know you're you're hoping to achieve deeper understanding not justa large set of recipes to go execute
 and it's interesting the walk groups of people because xqt reps apiece isunbelievably efficient if it's what you
 want to do if it's not what you want to do you're really stuck and and thatdifference is crucial and ever and
 everybody has a balance of let's say deeper understanding recipes and somepeople are really good at recognizing
 when the problem is to understand something DP deeply that make sense

0:24:48
Speaker 1 :it totally makes sense does it every
 stage of development deep on understanding on the team needed oh this

0:24:54
Speaker 0 :goes back to the art versus science
 question sure if you constantly unpacked everything for deeper understanding younever get anything done right and if you
 don't unpack understanding when you need to you'll do the wrong thing and then atevery juncture like human beings are
 these really weird things because everything you tell them has a millionpossible outputs all right and then they
 all interact in a hilarious way and then having some intuition about what youtell them what you do when do you
 intervene when do you not it's it's complicated all right so it's you knowessentially computationally unsolvable


0:25:33
Speaker 1 :yeah it's an intractable problem sure
 humans are a mess but with deep understanding do you mean also sort offundamental questions of things like
 what is a computer or why like think the why question is why are we even buildingthis like of purpose or do you mean more
 like going towards the fundamental limits of physics sort of really gettinginto the core of the sighs well in terms


0:26:07
Speaker 0 :of building the computer thinks simple
 think a little simpler so common practice is you build a computer andthen when somebody says I want to make
 it 10% faster you'll go in and say alright I need to make this bufferbigger and maybe I'll add an ad unit or
 you know I have this thing that's three instructions wide I'm going to make itfour instructions wide and what you see
 is each piece gets incrementally more complicated rightand then at some point you hit this
 limit like adding another feature or a buffer doesn't seem to make it anyfaster and then people say well that's
 because it's a fundamental limit and then somebody else to look at it and saywell actually the way you divided the
 problem up and the way that different features are interacting is limiting youand it has to be rethought rewritten
 right so then you refactor it and rewrite it and what people commonly findis the rewrite is not only faster but
 half is complicated from scratch yes so

0:27:04
Speaker 1 :how often in your career but just have
 you seen as needed maybe more generally to just throw the whole out thing out

0:27:14
Speaker 0 :this is where I'm on one end of it every
 three to five years which end are you on

0:27:18
Speaker 1 :

0:27:20
Speaker 0 :like rewrite more often right and three


0:27:22
Speaker 1 :

0:27:24
Speaker 0 :or five years is if you want to really
 make a lot of progress on computer architecture every five years you shoulddo one from scratch so where does the


0:27:31
Speaker 1 :x86 64 standard come in or what how


0:27:38
Speaker 0 :often do you I wrote the I was the
 co-author that's back in 98 that's 20

0:27:43
Speaker 1 :years ago yeah so that's still around


0:27:45
Speaker 0 :the instruction set it stuff has been
 extended quite a few times yes and instruction sets are less interestingand implementation underneath there's
 been on x86 architecture Intel's designed a few Eames is designed a fewvery different architectures and I don't
 want to go into too much of the detail about how often but it's there's atendency to rewrite it every you know 10
 years and it really should be every five

0:28:14
Speaker 1 :so you're saying you're an outlier in
 that sense in really more often we write more often well in here isn't that scary

0:28:21
Speaker 0 :yeah of course
 well scary - who - everybody involved

0:28:25
Speaker 1 :because like you said repeating the
 recipe is efficient companies want to make money well no in the individualjuniors want to succeed so you want to
 incrementally improve increase the buffer from three to four well we get

0:28:41
Speaker 0 :into the diminishing return curves I
 think Steve Jobs said this right so everyyou have a project and you start here
 and it goes up and they have Domitian return and to get to the next level youhave to do a new one in the initial
 starting point will be lower than the old optimization point but it'll gethigher so now you have two kinds of fear
 short-term disaster and long-term

0:29:06
Speaker 1 :disaster and you're you're wrong right


0:29:09
Speaker 0 :like you know people with a quarter by
 quarter business objective are terrified about changing everything yeah andpeople who are trying to run a business
 or build a computer for a long term objective know that the short-termlimitations block them from the long
 term success so if you look at leaders of companies that had really goodlong-term success every time they saw
 that they had to redo something they did

0:29:38
Speaker 1 :and so somebody has to speak up or you


0:29:40
Speaker 0 :do multiple projects in parallel like
 you optimize the old one while you build a new one and but the marketing guysthey're always like make promise me that
 the new computer is faster on every single thing and the computer architectsays well the new computer will be
 faster on the average but there's a distribution or results in performanceand you'll have some outliers that are
 slower and that's very hard because they have one customer cares about that one

0:30:05
Speaker 1 :so speaking of the long-term for over 50
 years now Moore's law has served a for me andmillions of others as an inspiring
 beacon what kind of amazing future brilliant engineers can build no I'mjust making your kids laugh all of today
 it was great so first in your eyes what is Moore's law if you could define for

0:30:29
Speaker 0 :people who don't know well the simple
 statement was from Gordon Moore was double the number of transistors everytwo years something like that and then
 my operational model is we increased the performance of computers by 2x every 2or 3 years and it's wiggled around
 substantially over time and also in how we deliver performance has changed

0:30:57
Speaker 1 :

0:30:58
Speaker 0 :but the foundational idea was to X two
 transistors every two years the current cadence is something like they call it ashrink factor like point six every two
 years which is not 0.5 but that that's

0:31:11
Speaker 1 :referring strictly again to the original


0:31:15
Speaker 0 :definition of transistor count a shrink


0:31:16
Speaker 1 :factors just getting them smaller small


0:31:18
Speaker 0 :as well as you use for a constant chip
 area if you make the transistor smaller by 0.6 then you get 1 over 0.6 moretransistors so can you linger a little


0:31:27
Speaker 1 :longer what's what's a broader what do
 you think should be the broader definition of Moore's law we mentionedbefore how you think of performance just
 broadly what's a good way to think about

0:31:41
Speaker 0 :Moore's law well first of all so I I've
 been aware of Moore's law for 30 years

0:31:47
Speaker 1 :in what sense well I've been designing


0:31:49
Speaker 0 :computers for 40 just watching it before


0:31:53
Speaker 1 :

0:31:55
Speaker 0 :your eyes kind of slow and somewhere
 where I became aware of it I was also informed that Moore's law was gonna diein 10 to 15 years and I thought that was
 true at first but then after 10 years it was gonna die in 10 to 15 years and thenat one point it was gonna die in 5 years
 and then it went back up to ten years and at some point I decided not to worryabout that particular product
 mastication for the rest of my life which is which is fun and then I joinedIntel and everybody said Moore's law is
 dead and I thought that's sad because it's the Moore's law company and it'snot dead and it's always been gonna die
 and you know humans you like these apocryphal kind of statements like we'llrun out of food or run out of air or you


0:32:39
Speaker 1 :know something right but it's still
 incredible this lived for as long as it has and yesthere's many people who believe now that
 Moore's Law instead you know they can

0:32:50
Speaker 0 :join the last 50 years of people had the


0:32:53
Speaker 1 :thing yeah there's a long tradition but
 why do you think if you can in touch try to understand it why do you think it'snot dead well for Hartley let's just


0:33:03
Speaker 0 :think people think Moore's law is one
 thing transistors get smaller but actually under the sheets ours literallythousands of innovations and almost all
 those innovations have their own diminishing return curves so if yougraph it it looks like a cascade of
 diminishing return curves I don't know what to call that but the result is anexponential curve at least it has been
 so and we keep inventing new things so if you're an expert in one of the thingson a diminishing return curve right and
 you can see it's plateau you will probably tell people well this is thisis done meanwhile some other pile of
 people are doing something different so that's that's just normal so thenthere's the observation of how small
 could a switching device be so a modern transistor is something like a thousandby a thousand by thousand atoms right
 and you get quantum effects down around two to two to ten atoms so you canimagine the transistor as small as 10 by
 10 by 10 so that's a million times smaller and then the quantumcomputational people are working away at
 how to use quantum effects so a thousand

0:34:19
Speaker 1 :

0:34:21
Speaker 0 :by thousand five thousand atoms it's a


0:34:23
Speaker 1 :really clean way of putting it well fin


0:34:27
Speaker 0 :like a modern transistor if you look at
 the fan it's like a hundred and twenty atoms wide but we can make that thinnerand then there's there's a gate wrapped
 around it and under spacing there's a whole bunch of geometry and you know acompetent transistor designer could
 count both atoms in every single direction like there's techniques now toalready put down atoms in a single
 atomic layer and you can place atoms if you want to it's just you know from amanufacturing process if placing an atom
 takes ten minutes and you need to put you know 10 to the 23rd atoms togetherto make a computer it would take a long
 time so the the methods are you know both shrinking things and then coming upwith effective ways to control what's
 happening manufacture stabling cheaply

0:35:18
Speaker 1 :

0:35:19
Speaker 0 :yeah so the innovation stocks pretty
 broad you know there there's equipment there's optics there'schemistry there's physics there's
 material science there's metallurgy there's lots of ideas about when you puttheir four materials together how they
 interact are they stable is I stable or temperature you know like are theyrepeatable you know there's look there's
 like literally thousands of technologies

0:35:44
Speaker 1 :involved but just for the shrinking you
 don't think we're quite yet close to the fundamental limit in physics I did a

0:35:50
Speaker 0 :talk on Moore's Law and I asked for a
 road map to a path of 100 and after two weeks they said we only got to fifty a

0:35:58
Speaker 1 :hundred what's a 100 extra hundred
 shrink we only got 15 I said once you go

0:36:02
Speaker 0 :

0:36:05
Speaker 1 :to another two weeks well here's the


0:36:07
Speaker 0 :thing about Moore's law right so I
 believe that the next 10 or 20 years of shrinking is going to happen right nowas a computer designer there's you have
 two stances you think it's going to shrink in which case you're designingand thinking about architecture in a way
 that you'll use more transistors or conversely not be swamped by thecomplexity of all the transistors you
 get right you have to have a strategy you know so you're open to the

0:36:39
Speaker 1 :possibility and waiting for the
 possibility of a whole new army of transistors ready to work I'm expecting

0:36:45
Speaker 0 :expecting more transistors every two or
 three years by a number large enough that how you think about design how youthink about architecture has to change
 like imagine you're you build built brick buildings out of bricks and everyyear the bricks are half the size or
 every two years well if you kept building bricks the same way you know somany bricks per person per day the
 amount of time to build a building would go up exponentially right right but ifyou said I know that's coming so now I'm
 going to design equipment and moves bricks faster uses them better becausemaybe you're getting something out of
 the smaller bricks more strengths inner walls you know less material efficiencyout of that so once you have a roadmap
 with what's going to happen transistors they're gonna get we're gonna get moreof them then you design
 was collateral rounded to take advantage of it and also to cope with it likethat's the thing people to understand
 it's like if I didn't believe in Moore's law and Moore's law transistors showedup my design teams were all drowned so


0:37:52
Speaker 1 :what's the what's the hardest part of
 this in flood of new transistors I mean even if you just look historicallythroughout your career what's what's the
 thing you what fundamentally changes when you add more transistors in in thetask of designing an architecture no


0:38:09
Speaker 0 :there's there's two constants right one
 is people don't get smarter I think by

0:38:15
Speaker 1 :the way there's some size shown that we
 do get smarter because nutrition whatever

0:38:22
Speaker 0 :sorry bring that what effect yes nobody
 understands it nobody knows if it's still going on so that's all or whether

0:38:27
Speaker 1 :it's real or not but yeah that's a I


0:38:29
Speaker 0 :sort of Amen but not if I believe for
 the most part people aren't getting much smarter the evidence doesn't support it

0:38:35
Speaker 1 :

0:38:36
Speaker 0 :that's right and then teams can't grow
 that much right all right so human beings understand you know we're reallygood in teams of ten you know up two
 teams of a hundred they can know each other beyond that you have to haveorganizational boundaries so you're kind
 of you have those are pretty hard constraints all right so then you haveto divide and conquer like as the
 designs get bigger you have to divide it into pieces you know that the power ofabstraction layers is really high we
 used to build computers out of transistors now we have a team thatturns transistors and logic cells and
 our team that turns them into functional you know it's another one it turns incomputers right so we have abstraction
 layers in there and you have to think about when do you shift gears on that wealso use faster computers to build
 faster computers so some algorithms run twice as fast on new computers but a lotabout rhythms are N squared so you know
 a computer with twice as many transistors and it might take four Tom'stimes as long to run so you have to
 refactor at the software like simply using faster computers to build biggercomputers doesn't work so so you have to
 think about all these things so in terms

0:39:46
Speaker 1 :of computing performance and the
 exciting possibility that more powerful computers bringis shrinking the thing we've been
 talking about one of the for you one of the biggest exciting possibilities ofadvancement in performance or is there
 are other directions that you're interested in like like in the directionof sort of enforcing given parallelism
 or like doing massive parallelism in terms of many many CPUs you knowstacking CPUs on top of each other that
 kind of that kind of parallelism or you kind of well think about it a different

0:40:21
Speaker 0 :way so old computers you know slow
 computers you said a equal B plus C times D pretty simple right and then wemade faster computers with vector units
 and you can do proper equations and matrices right and then modern like AIcomputations or like convolutional
 neural networks we you convolve one large data set against another and sothere's sort of this hierarchy of
 mathematics you know from simple equation to linearequations to matrix equations to it's a
 deeper kind of computation and the data sets are getting so big that people arethinking of data as a topology problem
 you know data is organized in some immense shape and then the computationwhich sort of wants to be get data from
 immense shape and do some computation on it so the with computers of a lot ofpeople to do is how about rhythms go
 much much further so that that paper you you reference the Sutton paper theytalked about you know like in a I
 started it was a ploy rule sets to something that's a very simplecomputational situation and then when
 they did first chess thing they solved deep searches so have a huge database ofmoves and results deep search but it's
 still just a search right now we we take large numbers of images and we use it toTrain these weight sets that we convolve
 across it's a completely different kind of phenomena we call that AI now they'redoing the next generation and if you
 look at it they're going up this mathema graph right and then computations theboth computation and data sets support
 going up that graph yeah the kind of

0:42:13
Speaker 1 :computation of my I mean I would argue
 that all of it is still a search right just like you said a topology problemsdata says he's searching the data sets
 for valuable data and also the actual optimization of your networks is a kindof search for the I don't know if you


0:42:33
Speaker 0 :looked at the inner layers of finding a
 cat it's not a search it's it's a set of endless projection so you knowprojection and here's a shadow of this
 phone yeah right then you can have a shadow of that onto something a shadowon that or something if you look in the
 layers you'll see this layer actually describes pointy ears and round eyenessand fuzziness and but the computation to
 tease out the attributes is not search right ain't like the inference partmight be searched but the trainings not
 search okay well 10 then in deep networks they look at layers and theydon't even know it's represented and yet
 if you take the layers out it doesn't work ok so if I don't think it's searchall right well but you have to talk to
 my mathematician about what that actually is oh you disagree but the the

0:43:25
Speaker 1 :it's just semantics I think it's not but
 it's certainly not I would say it's

0:43:29
Speaker 0 :absolutely not semantics but okay all


0:43:33
Speaker 1 :right well if you want to go there so
 optimization to me is search and we're trying to optimize the ability of aneural network to detect cat ears and
 this difference between chess and the space the incredibly multi-dimensionalhundred thousand dimensional space that
 you know networks are trying to optimize over is nothing like the chessboarddatabase so it's a totally different
 kind of thing and okay in that sense you can say yeah yeah you know I could see

0:44:07
Speaker 0 :how you you might say if if you the
 funny thing is it's the difference between given search space and foundsearch space exactly yeah maybe that's a
 different way

0:44:19
Speaker 1 :beautiful but okay but you're saying
 what's your sense in terms of the basic mathematical operations and thearchitectures can be hardwired that
 enables those operations do you see the CPUs of today still being a really corepart of executing those mathematical


0:44:37
Speaker 0 :operations yes
 well the operations you know continue to be add subtract loads or compare andbranch it's it's remarkable so it's it's
 interesting that the building blocks of you know computers or transistors andyou know under that atoms so you got
 atoms transistors logic gates computers right you know functional units andcomputers the building blocks of
 mathematics at some level are things like adds and subtracts and multipliesbut that's the space mathematics can
 describe is I think essentially infinite but the computers that run thealgorithms are still doing the same
 things now a given algorithm may say I need sparse data or I need 32-bit dataor I need you know like a convolution
 operation that naturally takes 8-bit data multiplies it and sums it up acertain way so the like the data types
 in tensorflow imply an optimization set but when you go write down a look at thecomputers it's an inorganic salt applies
 like like that hasn't changed much now the quantum researchers thinkthey're going to change that radically
 and then there's people who think about analog computing because you look in thebrain and it seems to be more analog ish
 you know that maybe there's a way to do that more efficiently but we have amillion acts on computation and I don't
 know the reference the relationship between computational let's sayintensity and ability to hit match
 mathematical abstractions I don't know anyway subscribe dad but but just likeyou saw an AI you went from rule sets
 the simple search to complex search does a found search like those are you knoworders of magnitude more computation to
 do and as we get the next two orders ofmagnitude your friend Roger godori said
 like every order magnitude changed the

0:46:39
Speaker 1 :computation fundamentally changes what
 the computation is doing here oh you

0:46:43
Speaker 0 :know the expression the difference in
 quantity is the difference in kind you know the difference between ant and anthill right or neuron and brain you know
 there's there's there's just indefinable place where the the quantity changed thequality right now we've seen that happen
 in mathematics multiple times and you know my my guess is it's gonna keep

0:47:08
Speaker 1 :happening so your senses yeah if you
 focus head down and shrinking a transistor let's not just head down and

0:47:15
Speaker 0 :we're aware about the software stacks
 that are running in the computational loads and we're kind of pondering whatdo you do with a petabyte of memory that
 wants to be accessed in a sparse way and have you know the kind of calculationsai programmers want so there's that
 there's a dialog interaction but when you go in the computer chip you know youfind adders and subtractors and
 multipliers and so if you zoom out then

0:47:42
Speaker 1 :with as you mentioned which Sutton the
 idea that most of the development in the last many decades in the AI researchcame from just leveraging computation
 and just the simple algorithms waiting for the computation to improve well

0:47:59
Speaker 0 :suffer guys have a thing that they
 called the the problem of early optimization right so if you write a bigsoftware stack and if you start
 optimizing like the first thing you write the odds of that being theperformance limiter is low but when you
 get the whole thing working can you make it to X faster by optimizing the rightthings sure while you're optimizing that
 could you've written a new software stack which would have been a betterchoice maybe now you have creative
 tension so but the whole time as you're

0:48:29
Speaker 1 :doing the writing the that's the
 software we're talking about the hardware underneath gets faster which

0:48:37
Speaker 0 :goes back to the Moore's laws Moore's
 Law is going to continue then your AI researchshould expect that to show up and then
 you make a slightly different set of choices then we've hit the wallnothing's gonna happen and from here
 it's just us rewriting algorithms like that seems like a failed strategy forthe last 30 years of Moore's laws death


0:49:00
Speaker 1 :so so can you just linger on it I think
 you've answered it but it just asked the same dumb question over and over so whatwhy do you think Moore's law is not
 going to die which is the most promising exciting possibility of why it won'tdone that's five 10 years so is it that
 continues shrinking the transistor or is it another s-curve that steps in and ittotally so dope shrinking the transistor


0:49:26
Speaker 0 :is literally thousands of innovations


0:49:30
Speaker 1 :right so there's so this they're all


0:49:32
Speaker 0 :answers and it's there's a whole bunch
 of s-curves just kind of running their course and being reinvented and newthings you know the the semiconductor
 fabricators and technologists have all announced what's called nano wires sothey they took a fan which had a gate
 around it and turned that into a little wire so you have better control that andthey're smaller and then from there
 there's some obvious steps about how to shrink that so the metallurgy aroundwire stocks and stuff has very obvious
 abilities to shrink and you know there's a whole combination of things there todo your sense is that we're gonna get a


0:50:11
Speaker 1 :lot yes this innovation from just that


0:50:16
Speaker 0 :shrinking yeah like a factor of a
 hundred salade yeah I would say that's

0:50:19
Speaker 1 :incredible and it's totally it's only 10


0:50:23
Speaker 0 :or 15 years now you're smarter you might


0:50:25
Speaker 1 :know but to me it's totally
 unpredictable of what that hundred x would bring in terms of the nature ofthe computation and people be yeah you


0:50:34
Speaker 0 :familiar with Bell's law so for a long
 time those mainframes Mini's workstation PC mobile Moore's Lawdrove faster smaller computers right and
 then we were thinking about Moore's law rajae godori said every 10x generates anew computation so scalar vector made
 Erichs topological computation right and if you go look at the industry transthere was no mainframes and
 mini-computers and PCs and then the internet took off and then we got mobiledevices and now we're building 5g
 wireless with one millisecond latency and people are starting to think aboutthe smart world where everything knows
 you recognizes you like like like the transformations are going to be likeunpredictable how does it make you feel


0:51:27
Speaker 1 :that you're one of the key architects of
 this kind of futures you're not we're not talking about the architects of thehigh-level people who build the Angry
 Bird apps and flapping

0:51:43
Speaker 0 :Angry Bird of who knows we're gonna be
 that's the whole point of the universe

0:51:46
Speaker 1 :let's take a stand at that and the
 attention distracting nature of mobile phones I'll take a stand but anyway in

0:51:55
Speaker 0 :

0:51:56
Speaker 1 :terms of that matters much the the side
 effects of smartphones or the attention distraction which part well who knows

0:52:03
Speaker 0 :you know where this is all leading it's
 changing so fast wax my parents do steal my sister's for hiding in the closetwith a wired phone with a dial on it
 stop talking your friends all day right now my wife feels with my kids fortalking to their friends all day on text
 looks the same to me it's always it's

0:52:22
Speaker 1 :echoes of the same thing okay but you
 are the one of the key people architecting the hardware of this futurehow does that make you feel do you feel


0:52:32
Speaker 0 :

0:52:33
Speaker 1 :responsible do you feel excited so we're


0:52:35
Speaker 0 :we're in a social context so there's
 billions of people on this planet there are literally millions of people workingon technology I feel lucky to be you
 know what doing what I do and getting paid for it and there's an interest init but there's so many things going on
 in parallel it's like the actions are so unpredictable if I wasn't here somebodyelse are doing the the vectors of all
 these different things are happening all the time you know there's aI'm sure some philosopher or meta
 philosophers you know wondering about how we transform our world so you can't

0:53:16
Speaker 1 :deny the fact that these tools whether
 that these tools are changing our world that's right do you think it's changing

0:53:28
Speaker 0 :for the better so some of these I read
 this thing recently it said the peat the two disciplines with the highest GREscores in college are physics in
 philosophy right and they're both sort of trying to answer the question why isthere anything right and the
 Philosopher's you know are on the kind of theological side and the physicistsare obviously on the you know the
 material side and there's a hundred billion galaxies with a hundred billionstars it seems well repetitive at best
 so I you know there's on our way to ten billion people I mean it's hard to saywhat it's all for is that's what you're
 asking

0:54:10
Speaker 1 :yeah I guess I guess I do tend to are


0:54:11
Speaker 0 :significantly increases in complexity
 and I'm curious about how computation like like our world our physical worldinherently generates mathematics it's
 kind of obvious right so we have X Y Z coordinates you take a sphere you makeit bigger you get a surface that falls
 you know grows by r-squared like it generally generates mathematics and themathematicians and the physicists have
 been having a lot of fun talking to each other for years and computation has beenlet's say relatively pedestrian like
 computation in terms of mathematics has been doing binary binary algebra whilethose guys have been gallivanting
 through the other realms of possibility right now recently the computation letsyou do math m'q mathematical
 computations that are sophisticated enough that nobody understands how theanswers came out right machine learning


0:55:10
Speaker 1 :

0:55:11
Speaker 0 :machine lying yeah it used to be you get
 data set you guess at a function the function is considered physics if it'spredictive of new functions
 data sets modern you can take a large data set with no intuition about what itis and use machine learning to find a
 pattern that has no function right and it can arrive at results that I don'tknow if they're completely
 mathematically describable so a computation is kind of done somethinginteresting compared to a POV plus see


0:55:47
Speaker 1 :there's something reminiscent of that
 step from the basic operations of addition to taking a step towards newall networks that's reminiscent of what
 life on Earth and its origins was doing do you think we're creating sort of thenext step in our evolution in creating
 artificial intelligence systems that I

0:56:08
Speaker 0 :don't know I mean you know if there's so
 much in the universe already it's hard to say well I'm standing in his hold arehuman beings working on additional
 abstraction layers and possibilities yet appear so does that mean that humanbeings don't need dogs you know no like
 like there's so many things that are all simultaneously interesting and useful

0:56:31
Speaker 1 :but you've seen through I agree you've
 seen great and greater level abstractions and built in artificialmachines right do you think when you
 look at humans you think that the look of all life on earth as a singleorganism building this thing this
 machine that greater and greater levels of abstraction do you think humans arethe peak the top of the food chain in
 this long arc of history on earth or do you think we're just somewhere in themiddle are we are we the basic
 functional operations of a CPU are we the C++ program the Python Perl Network

0:57:10
Speaker 0 :like somebody's you know people have
 calculated like how many operations does the brain do and something you know I'veseen the number 10 to the 18th about
 bunch of times arrive different ways so could you make a computer that did 10 tothe 20th operations yes sure do you
 think we're gonna do that now is there something magical about how brainscompute things I don't know you know my
 personal experiences interesting cuz you know you think youknow how you think and then you have all
 these ideas and you can't figure out how they happened and if you meditate youknow the like what what you can be aware
 of is interesting so I don't know if brains are magical or not you know thephysical evidence says no lots of
 people's personal experiences yes so what would be funny as if brains aremagical and yet we can make brains with
 more computation you know I don't know what to say about that but what do you

0:58:06
Speaker 1 :think magic is an emergent phenomena
 what would be our than me I don't know

0:58:12
Speaker 0 :

0:58:15
Speaker 1 :teller of what what what in your view is


0:58:18
Speaker 0 :consciousness with with consciousness


0:58:21
Speaker 1 :yeah like what you know cautiousness
 love things that are these deeply human things that seems to emerge from ourbrain is that something that we'll be
 able to make encode in chips that get faster and faster and faster and faster

0:58:38
Speaker 0 :the flick of 10 our conversations no but
 nobody really knows can you summarize it

0:58:42
Speaker 1 :

0:58:43
Speaker 0 :in a couple of couple of words many
 people have observed that organisms run at lots of different levels right if yougot two neurons somebody said you'd have
 one sensory neuron and one motor neuron right so we move towards things and awayfrom things and we have physical
 integrity and safety or not right and then if you look at the animal kingdomyou can see brains that are a little
 more complicated and at some point there's a planning system and thenthere's an emotional system that's you
 know happy about being safe or unhappy about being threatened right and thenour brains have massive numbers of
 structures you know like planning and movement and thinking and feeling anddrives and emotions and we seem to have
 multiple layers of thinking systems and we have a brain a dream system thatnobody understands whatsoever which I
 find completely hilarious and you can think in a way that those systems aremore independent and you can observe you
 know the different parts of yourself can observeI don't know which one's magical I don't
 know which ones not computational so is

0:59:56
Speaker 1 :it possible that it's all computation


0:59:59
Speaker 0 :probably is there a limit to computation
 I don't think so do you think the universe is a computer

1:00:03
Speaker 1 :I think he seems to be it's a weird kind


1:00:06
Speaker 0 :of computer because if it was a computer
 right like when they do calculations on what it how much calculation it takes todescribe quantum effects is unbelievably
 high so if it was a computer when you built it out of something that waseasier to compute right that's that's a
 funny it's a funny system but then thesimulation guys have pointed out that
 the rules are kind of interesting like when you look really close it'suncertain and the speed of light says
 you could only look so far and things can't be simultaneous except for the oddentanglement problem where they seem to
 be like the rules are all kind of weird and somebody said physics is like having50 equations with 50 variables to define
 50 variables like you know it's it's you know like physics itself has been ashitshow for thousands of years it seems
 odd when you get to the corners of everything you know it's eitheruncomputable or on definable or
 uncertain it's almost like the designers

1:01:07
Speaker 1 :the simulation are trying to prevent us
 from understanding it perfectly but but

1:01:13
Speaker 0 :also the things that require
 calculations requires so much calculation that our idea of theuniverse of a computer is absurd because
 every single little bit of it takes all the computation in the universe tofigure out gee that's a weird kind of
 computer you know you say the simulation is running in the computer which has bydefinition infinite computations not
 infinite

1:01:35
Speaker 1 :oh you mean if the universe is infinite


1:01:38
Speaker 0 :yeah piece of our universe seems to take
 infinite computation I hit you're out just a lot whoa a lot some pretty bignumber compute this little teeny spot
 takes all the mass in the local one little year by one like your space it'sclose enough to infinite so it's a heck


1:01:56
Speaker 1 :of a computer if it is one I know it's


1:01:56
Speaker 0 :it's it's a weird it's a weird
 description because the simulations description seems toothe break when you look closely at it
 but the rules in universe seemed to imply something's up that seems a littlearbitrary the whole the universe the


1:02:11
Speaker 1 :whole thing the the laws of physics you
 know it just seems like like how did it come out to be yeah the way it is but

1:02:20
Speaker 0 :lots of people talk about that it's you
 know it's like I said the two smartest groups of humans are working on the sameproblem different different aspects and
 they're both complete failures so that's kind of cool

1:02:32
Speaker 1 :they might succeed eventually well after


1:02:34
Speaker 0 :two thousand years the trend isn't good


1:02:38
Speaker 1 :two thousand years is nothing in the
 span of the history of the universe so we have some time but the next thousand

1:02:43
Speaker 0 :years doesn't look good either so that's


1:02:46
Speaker 1 :what everybody says that every stage but
 with Moore's law as you've just described not being dead the exponentialgrowth the technology the future seems
 pretty incredible well it'll be

1:02:57
Speaker 0 :interesting that's for sure that's right


1:03:00
Speaker 1 :so what are your thoughts on Ray
 Kurzweil sense that exponential improvement and technology will continueindefinitely that is that how you see
 Moore's law do you see Moore's law more broadly and since the technology of allkinds has a way of stacking s curves on
 top of each other where it'll be exponential and then we'll see all kindsof what was an exponential of a million


1:03:25
Speaker 0 :mean that's that's a pretty amazing
 number and that's just for a local little piece of silicon now it's imagineyou say decided to get a thousand tons
 of silicon to collaborate in one computer at a million times the densitylike now you know you're talking I don't
 know 10 to the 20th more computation power then our current alreadyunbelievably fast computers like nobody
 knows what that's going to mean you know the sci-fi guys called you knowcomputron 'i'm like when like a local
 civilization turns the nearby star into a computer I like I don't that's true

1:04:07
Speaker 1 :but so just even when you shrink a
 transistor the that's only one dimension

1:04:11
Speaker 0 :of the ripple effects of that but people
 tend to think about computers the cost problem right so computers aremade out of silicon and minor amounts of
 metals and you know this and that none of those things cost any money likethere's plenty of sand like like you
 could just turn the beach and a little bit ocean water in the computers so allthe cost is and equipment to do it
 and the trend on equipment is once you figure out a build the equipment thetrend of cost is zero Elon said first
 you figure out what configuration you want the atoms in and then how to putthem there right yeah
 cuz well what here's you know his his great insight is people are howconstrained I have this thing I know how
 it works and then little tweaks to that will generate something as opposed towhat do I actually want and then figure
 out how to build it it's a very different mindset and almost nobody hasit obviously well let me ask on that


1:05:13
Speaker 1 :topic you were one of the key early
 people in the development of autopilot at least in the hardware side Elon Muskbelieves that autopilot and vehicle
 autonomy if you just look at that problem can follow this kind ofexponential improvement in terms of the
 ha the how question that we're talking about there's no reason why I can't whatare your thoughts on this particular
 space of vehicle autonomy and you're a part of it and Elon Musk's and Tesla'svision well the computer you need to


1:05:45
Speaker 0 :build was straightforward and you can
 argue well doesn't need to be 2 times faster or 5 times or 10 times but that'sjust a matter of time or price in the
 short run so that's that's not a big deal you don't have to be especiallysmart to drive a car so it's not like a
 super hard problem I mean the big problem with safety is attention whichcomputers are really good at not skills


1:06:13
Speaker 1 :well let me push back on one you see
 everything you said it's correct but we as humans tend to tend to take forgranted how how incredible our vision
 system is so you can drive a car of 2050

1:06:28
Speaker 0 :vision
 and you can train a neural network to extract a distance of any object in theshape of any surface from a video and
 data but that really simple not simple I

1:06:41
Speaker 1 :

1:06:42
Speaker 0 :look that's a simple data problem it's
 not it's not simple it's because you

1:06:46
Speaker 1 :because it's not just detecting object
 it's understanding the scene and it's being able to do it in a way thatdoesn't make errors so the beautiful
 thing about the human vision system and the entire brain around the whole thingis we were able to fill in the gaps it's
 not just about perfectly detecting cars it's inferring the occluded cars it'strying to it's it's understanding the I
 think it's mostly a bigger problem you

1:07:13
Speaker 0 :

1:07:14
Speaker 1 :so you think what data you know with
 compute with improvement of computation with improvement in collection well

1:07:21
Speaker 0 :there is a you know when you're driving
 a car and somebody cuts you off your brain has theories about why they did ityou know they're a bad person they're
 distracted they're dumb you know you can listen to yourselfright so you know if you think that
 narrative is important to be able to successfully drive a car then currentautopilot systems can't do it but if
 cars are ballistic things with tracks and probabilistic changes of speed anddirection and roads are fixed and given
 by the way they don't change dynamically right you can map the world reallythoroughly you can place every object
 really thoroughly right you can calculate trajectories of things reallythoroughly right but everything you said


1:08:07
Speaker 1 :about really thoroughly has a different
 degree of difficulty so you could say at

1:08:13
Speaker 0 :some point computer autonomous systems
 will be way better it's things that humans are allows yet like it'll bebetter at abstention they'll always
 remember there was a pothole in the road that humans keep forgetting aboutthey'll remember that this set of roads
 how these weirdo lines on it the computers figured out once andespecially if they get updates so if
 somebody changes a given like that Akita robots and stuff somebody said is tomaximize two Givens
 okay right so though having a robot pick up this bottle cap is ways you put a reddot on the top because then you have to
 figure out you know if you want to do a certain thing with it you know maximizethe Givens is the thing and autonomous
 systems are happily maximizing the Givens like humans when you drivesomeplace new you remember it because
 you're processing it the whole time and after the 50th time you drove to workyou get to work you don't know how you
 got there right you're on autopilot right autonomous cars are always onautopilot but the cars have no theories
 about why they got cut off or why they're in traffic so they'll never stoppaying attention right so I tend to


1:09:25
Speaker 1 :believe you do have deaf theories mental
 models of other people especially pedestrians cyclists but also with othercars everything you said is like is
 actually essential to driving driving is a lot more complicated than peoplerealize I think so sort of to push back
 slightly but cut into traffic right yeah

1:09:45
Speaker 0 :you can't just wait for a gap you have
 to be somewhat aggressive you'd be surprised how simple a calculation forthat is I may be on that particular


1:09:54
Speaker 1 :point but there's a that it may be asked
 you to push back I would be surprised you know what yeah I'll just say where Istand I would be very surprised but I
 think it's you might be surprised how complicated it is that I'd say that I

1:10:09
Speaker 0 :tell people's like progress disappoints
 in the short run the surprises in the long run it's very possible yeah I

1:10:14
Speaker 1 :

1:10:16
Speaker 0 :suspect in 10 years it'll be just like
 taken for granted yeah but you're

1:10:19
Speaker 1 :probably right now look like it's gonna


1:10:22
Speaker 0 :be a $50 solution that nobody cares
 about like GPS is like wow GPS is we have satellites in space that tell youwhere your location is it was a really
 big deal now everything is the GPS I

1:10:33
Speaker 1 :mean yeah it's true but I do think that
 systems that involve human behavior are more complicated than we give themcredit for so we can do incredible
 things with technology that don't involve humans but when you look humans

1:10:46
Speaker 0 :are less complicated than people you
 know frequently obscure I've maybe I stand off right out of large numbers ofpatterns and just keep doing it over


1:10:56
Speaker 1 :but I can't trust you because you're a
 human that's something something a human would say but I might my hope was on thepoint you've made is even if no matter
 who is right Eve there I'm hoping that there's a lot of things that humansaren't good at that machines are
 definitely good I like you said attention and things like that wellthey'll be so much better that the
 overall picture of safety in autonomy will be obviously cars will be safereven if they're not as good I'm a big


1:11:25
Speaker 0 :believer in safety I mean there are
 already the current safety systems like cruise control that doesn't let you runinto people and lane-keeping there are
 so many features that you just look at the pareto of accidents and knocking offlike 80% of them you know super doable


1:11:43
Speaker 1 :just a wing guard on the autopilot team
 and the efforts there the it seems to be that there's a very intense scrutiny bythe media and the public in terms of
 safety the pressure the bar but before autonomous vehicles what are your sortof as a person they're working on the
 hardware and trying to build a system that builds a safe vehicle and so onwhat was your sense about that pressure
 is it unfair is it expected of new

1:12:12
Speaker 0 :technology it seems reasonable I was
 interested I talked to both American and European regulators and I was worriedthat the regulations would write into
 the rules technology solutions like modern brake systems imply hydraulicbrakes so if you'll read the regulations
 to meet the letter of the law for brakes it sort of has to be hydraulic right andthe regulator said there they're
 interested in the use cases like a head-on crash an offset crash don't hitpedestrians don't run into people don't
 leave the road don't run a red light or a stop light they were very much intothe scenarios and you know and they had
 they had all the data about which scenarios injured or killed to mostpeople and for the most part those
 conversations were like what's the right thing to do to take the next stepnow elan is very interested also in the
 benefits of autonomous driving or freeing people's time and attention aswell as safety and I think that's also
 an interesting thing but you know building an autonomous system so they'resafe and safer and people seemed since
 the goals to be tannic seifer's and people having the bar to be safer thanpeople and scrutinizing accidents seems
 philosophically you know correct so I think that's a good thing

1:13:42
Speaker 1 :what R is is different than the things
 you've worked at new Intel AMD apple with autopilot chip design and hardwaredesign what are interesting or
 challenging aspects of building this specialized kind of competing system inthe automotive space I mean there's two


1:14:00
Speaker 0 :tricks to building like an automotive
 computer one is to software our team the machine learning team is developingalgorithms that are changing fast
 so as you're building the the accelerator you have this you know worryor intuition that the algorithms will
 change enough that the accelerator will be the wrong one right and there's thegeneric thing which is if you build a
 really good general-purpose computers hey it's performance is one and then GPUguys will deliver about 5x to
 performance for the same amount of silicon because instead of discoveringparallelism you're given parallelism and
 then special accelerators get another two to five X on top of a GPU becauseyou say I know the math is always 8-bit
 integers and two 32-bit accumulators and the operations are the subsets ofmathematical possibilities so although
 you know AI accelerators have a claimed performance benefit over GPUs because inthe narrow math space you're nailing the
 algorithm now you still try to make it programmable but the AI field ischanging really fast so there's a you
 know there's little creative tension era of I want the acceleration afforded byspecialization without being over
 specialized so that the new algorithm is so muchmore effective that you'd have been
 better off on a GPU so there's attention there to build a good computer for anapplication like automotive there's all
 kinds of sensor inputs and safety processors and a bunch of stuff so oneof loans goal is to make it super
 affordable so every car gets an autopilot computer so some of the recentstartups you look at and they have a
 server in the trunk because they're saying I'm going to build this autopilotcomputer replaces the driver so their
 cost budgets ten or twenty thousand dollars and eelain's constraint was I'mgonna put one every in every car whether
 people buy autonomous driving or not so the cost constraint he had in mind wasgreat right and to hit that you had to
 think about the system design that's complicated it's it's fun you know it'slike it's like it's craftsmen's work
 like a violin maker right you could say Stradivarius is this incredible thingthe musicians are incredible but the guy
 making the violin you know picked wood and sanded it and then he cut it youknow and he glued it and you know and he
 waited for the right day so that when you put the finish on it didn't you knowdo something dumb
 that's craftsmen's work right you may be a genius craftsman because you have thebest techniques and you discover a new
 one but most engineers craftsmen's work and humans really like to do that youknow smart humans oh no everybody oh I
 know I used to I dug ditches when I was in college I got really good at itsatisfying yeah so digging ditches is


1:16:53
Speaker 1 :also craft malware yeah of course


1:16:55
Speaker 0 :so so there's an expression called
 complex mastery behavior so when you're learning something that's fun becauseyou're learning something when you do
 something that's wrote and simple it's not that satisfying but if the stepsthat you have to do or complicate it and
 you're good at them it's satisfying to do them and then if you're intrigued byit all as you're doing them you
 sometimes learn new things that you can raise your game but Christmas work isgood
 in engineers like engineering is complicated enough that you have tolearn a lot of skills and then a lot of
 what you do is then craftsmen's work which is fun autonomous driving building

1:17:33
Speaker 1 :a very
 a resource-constrained computer so computer has to be cheap enough that putin every single car that's essentially
 boils down to craftsmen's work it's saying genius so there's thoughtful

1:17:47
Speaker 0 :decisions and problems to solve and
 trade-offs to make do you need 10 Cameron ports or 8 you know you'rebuilding for the current car or the next
 one you know how do you do the safety stuff you know there's there's a wholebunch of details but it's fun but it's
 not like I'm building a new type and they're all networked which has a newmathematics and a new computer at work
 do you know that that's like there's a there's more invention than that but therejection to practice once you picked
 the architecture you look inside and what do you seeadders and multipliers and memories and
 you know the basics so computers is always just this weird set ofabstraction layers of ideas and thinking
 that reduction to practice is transistors and wires and you knowpretty basic stuff and that's an
 interesting phenomena by the way that like factory work like lots of peoplethink factory work is Road assembly
 stuff I've been on the assembly line like the people work that really likedit it's a really great job it's really
 complicated putting cars together is hard right and in the cars moving andthe parts are moving and sometimes the
 parts are damaged and you have to coordinate putting all the stufftogether and people are good at it
 they're good at it and I remember one day I went to work and the line was shutdown for some reason and then some of
 the guys sitting around were really bummed because they they had reorganizeda bunch of stuff and they were gonna hit
 a new record for the number of cars built that day and they were all gung hoto do it and these were big tough
 buggers yeah you know but what they did was complicated and you couldn't do ityeah and I mean well after a while you


1:19:21
Speaker 1 :

1:19:22
Speaker 0 :could but you'd have to work your way up
 cuz you know like putting a bright what's called the bright stuff at thetrim on a car
 on a moving assembly line where it has to be attached 25 places in a minute anda half is unbelievably complicated and
 and and human beings can do it's really goodI think that's harder than driving a car
 by the way putting together working

1:19:45
Speaker 1 :

1:19:47
Speaker 0 :working on the factory to smart


1:19:49
Speaker 1 :people can disagree yeah I think drive
 driving a car will get you in the

1:19:54
Speaker 0 :factory something will see you're not


1:19:58
Speaker 1 :for us humans driving a car is easy I'm
 saying building a machine that drives a car is not easyok ok driving a car is easy for humans
 because we've been evolving for billions of years

1:20:11
Speaker 0 :drive cars yeah no juice the pail if the
 cars are super cool no now you join the

1:20:16
Speaker 1 :rest of the internet and mocking me ok


1:20:20
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah intrigued by your you know
 your anthropology yeah it says we have

1:20:28
Speaker 1 :to go dig into that there's some
 inaccuracies there yes ok but in general what have you learned in terms ofthinking about passion craftsmanship
 tension chaos you know the whole mess of it or what have you learned have takenaway from your time working with Elon
 Musk working at Tesla which is known to be a place of chaos innovationcraftsmanship and I really like the way


1:21:04
Speaker 0 :he thought like you think you have an
 understanding about what first principles of something is and then youtalk to you alone about it and you you
 didn't scratch the surface you know he has a deep belief that no matter whatyou do is a local maximum right
 I had a friend he invented a better electric motor and it was like a lotbetter than what we were using and one
 day he came by he said you know I'm a little disappointed cuz you know this isreally great and you didn't seem that
 impressed and I said you know and the super intelligent aliens come are theygonna be looking for you like where is
 he the guy you built the motor yeah probably not you know like like the butdoing interesting work that's both
 innovative and let's say craftsmen's work on the current thing it's reallysatisfying it's good and and that's cool
 and then Elon was good taking everything apart and like what's the deep firstprinciple oh no what's really
 what's really you know you know you know that that you know ability to look at itwithout assumptions and and how
 constraints is super wild you know we build rocket ship and using the same car

1:22:17
Speaker 1 :

1:22:18
Speaker 0 :you know everything and that's super fun
 and he's into it too like when they first landed to SpaceX Rockets at Teslawe had a video projector in the big room
 and like five hundred people came down and when they landed everybody cheeredand some people cried it was so cool
 alright but how did you do that well it was super hard and then people say wellit's chaotic really to get out of all
 your assumptions you think that's not going to be unbelievably painful andthere's Elon tough yeah probably the
 people look back on it and say boy I'm really happy I had that experience to gotake apart that many layers of
 assumptions sometimes super fun sometimes painful soit could be emotionally and


1:23:06
Speaker 1 :intellectually painful that whole
 process just stripping away assumptions

1:23:10
Speaker 0 :yeah I imagine 99% of your thought
 process is protecting your self conception and 98% of that's wrong yeahnow you got there math right no you
 think your feeling when you get back into that one bit that's useful and nowyou're open and you have the ability to
 do something different I don't know if I got the math right it might be ninetynine point nine but in 850 imagining it


1:23:39
Speaker 1 :the 50% is hard enough yeah now for a


1:23:43
Speaker 0 :long time I've suspected you could get
 better look you can think better you can think more clearly you can take thingsapart and there's lots of examples of
 that people who do that so any line is

1:23:59
Speaker 1 :an example of that parent or an example


1:24:03
Speaker 0 :says you know if I am I'm fun to talk to
 certainly I've learned a lot of stuff right well here's the other thing it'slike I talk like like I read books and
 people think oh you read books well no I brought a couple booksawake for 55 years
 well maybe 50 cuz I didn't read learned read tall as H or something and and itturns out when people write books they
 often take 20 years of their life where they passionately did something reduceit to to 200 pages that's kind of fun
 and then the goat you go online and you can find out who wrote the best booksand who like you know that's kind of
 Alda so there's this wild selection process and then you can read it and forthe most part to understand it and then
 you can go apply it like I went to one company and I thought I haven't managedmuch before so I read 20 management
 books and I started talking to him basically compared to all the VP'srunning around I'd run night read 19
 more management books than anybody else was it even that hardyeah and a half the stuff worked like
 first time it wasn't even rocket science but at the core of that is questioning

1:25:14
Speaker 1 :the assumptions okay sort of entering
 the thinking first principles thinking sort of looking at the reality of thesituation and using it using that
 knowledge applying that knowledge so

1:25:29
Speaker 0 :mean yes so I would say my brain has
 this idea that you can question first assumptions and but I can go days at atime and forget that and you have to
 kind of like circle back data observation because it is because part

1:25:43
Speaker 1 :Allen gene well it's hard to keep it


1:25:45
Speaker 0 :front and center because you know you're
 you operate on so many levels all the time and you know getting this donetakes priority or you know being happy
 takes priority or you know screwing around takes priority like like like howyou go through life it's complicated
 yeah and then you remember oh yeah I could really I think first principles somuch that's that's tiring you know
 what you do for a while that's kind of

1:26:12
Speaker 1 :cool so just as the last question your
 sense from the big picture from the first principles do you think you kindof answered already but do you think
 autonomous driving something we can solve on a timeline of years soone two three five ten years as opposed


1:26:34
Speaker 0 :to a century yeah definitely just to


1:26:35
Speaker 1 :linger and a little longer
 where's the confidence coming from is it the fundamentals of the problem thefundamentals of building a hardware and


1:26:46
Speaker 0 :the software as a computational problem
 understanding ballistics roles topography it seems pretty solvable Imean and you can see this you know like
 like speech recognition for a long time people are doing you know frequency anddomain analysis and and all kinds of
 stuff and that didn't work for at all right and then they did deep learningabout it and it worked great and it took
 multiple iterations and you know time is driving his way past the frequencyanalysis point you know use radar don't
 run into things and the data gathering is going up in the computations going upand the algorithm understanding is going
 up and there's a whole bunch of problems getting solved like that the data side

1:27:32
Speaker 1 :is really powerful but I disagree with
 both you and you and I'll tell you and once again as I did before that thatwhen you add human beings into the
 picture the it's no longer a ballistics problem it's something more complicatedbut I could be very well proven cars are


1:27:51
Speaker 0 :hardly damped in terms are ready to
 change like the steering and the steering systems really slow compared toa computer the acceleration of the
 acceleration is really slow yeah on a

1:28:01
Speaker 1 :certain time scale on a ballistics time
 scale but human behavior I don't know it yeah I shouldn't say it beans are really

1:28:08
Speaker 0 :slow to weed weirdly we operate
 you know half a second behind reality nobody really understands that oneeither it's pretty funny
 yeah yeah so no I will be with very well

1:28:21
Speaker 1 :could be surprised and I think with the
 rate of improvement in all aspects I'm both the computed in the the thesoftware and the hardware there's gonna
 be pleasant surprises all over the place

1:28:33
Speaker 0 :

1:28:35
Speaker 1 :speaking of unpleasant surprises many
 people have worries about a singularity in the development of AIforgive me for such questions you know


1:28:43
Speaker 0 :what when AI improves exponentially and


1:28:45
Speaker 1 :reaches a point of superhuman level
 general intelligence you know beyond the point there's no looking back do youshare this worry of existential threats
 from artificial intelligence from computers becoming superhuman levelintelligent no not really


1:29:02
Speaker 0 :you know like we already have a very
 stratified society and then if you look at the whole animal kingdom ofcapabilities and abilities and interests
 and you know smart people have their niche and you know normal people havetheir niche and craftsmen's have their
 niche and you know animals have their niche I suspect that the domains ofinterest for things that you know
 astronomically different like the whole something got 10 times smarter than usand wanted to track us all down because
 what we like to have coffee at Starbucks like it doesn't seem plausible no isthere an existential problem that how do
 you live in a world where there's something way smarter than you and youyou based your kind of self-esteem on
 being the smartest local person well there's what 0.1% of the population whothinks that because the rest of the
 populations been dealing with it since they were bornso the the breadth of possible
 experience that can be interesting is really big and you know superintelligence seems likely although we
 still don't know if we're magical but I suspect we're not and it seems likelythat'll create possibilities that are
 interesting for us and it's its interests will be interesting for thatfor whatever it is it's not obvious why
 it's interest would somehow want to fight over some square foot of dirt oryou know whatever then you know the
 usual fears are about so you don't think

1:30:38
Speaker 1 :you'll inherit some of the darker
 aspects of human nature depends on how

1:30:42
Speaker 0 :you think reality is constructed so for
 for whatever reasons human beings are and that's a creative tension inopposition with both are good and
 bad forces like there's lots of philosophical understandings of thatright I don't know why that would be
 different so you think the evils is

1:31:03
Speaker 1 :necessary for the good I mean the
 tension I don't know about evil but like

1:31:09
Speaker 0 :we live in a competitive world where
 your good is somebody else's you know evil you know there's there's themalignant part of it but that seems to
 be self-limiting although occasionally it's it's super horrible but yeah look

1:31:27
Speaker 1 :there's a debate over ideas and some
 people have different beliefs and that that debate itself is a process so theat arriving at something you know I


1:31:37
Speaker 0 :wouldn't continue yeah just you but you


1:31:41
Speaker 1 :don't think that whole process will
 leave humans behind in a way that's painfulan emotionally painful yes for the one
 for the point one percent they'll be

1:31:51
Speaker 0 :there why isn't it already painful for a
 large percentage of the population and it is I mean Society does have a lot ofstress in it about the 1% and the bath
 of this and about to that but you know everybody has a lot of stress in theirlife about what they find satisfying and
 and you know know yourself seems to be the proper dictum and pursue somethingthat makes your life meaningful seems
 proper and there's so many avenues on that like there's so much unexploredspace at every single level
 you know I'm somewhat of my nephew called me a jaded optimist you know soit's there's a beautiful tension that in


1:32:34
Speaker 1 :that label but if you were to look back
 at your life and could relive a moment a set of moments because there were thehappiest times in your life outside of
 family what would that be I don't want

1:32:53
Speaker 0 :to relive any moments I like that I like
 that situation where you have some amount of optimism and thenthe anxiety of the unknown so you love


1:33:06
Speaker 1 :the unknown do you the mystery of it I
 don't know about the mystery it sure

1:33:10
Speaker 0 :gets your blood pumping what do you


1:33:14
Speaker 1 :think is the meaning of this whole thing
 of life on this pale blue dot it seems

1:33:21
Speaker 0 :to be what it does like the universe for
 whatever reason makes atoms which makes us which we do stuff and we figure outthings and we explore things and that's


1:33:38
Speaker 1 :just what it is


1:33:40
Speaker 0 :it's not just yeah it is you know Jim I


1:33:42
Speaker 1 :don't think there's a better place to
 end it it's a huge honor and well super fun thank you so much for talking todayall right great
