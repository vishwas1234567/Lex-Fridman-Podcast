Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Dimitri korkin he's a professor of bioinformatics and computational biologyat WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute
 where he specializes in bioinformatics of complex diseases computationalgenomics systems biology and biomedical
 data analytics I came across Dimitri's work one in February his group used theviral genome of the Cova 19 to
 reconstruct the 3d structure of its major viral proteins and theirinteraction with the human proteins in
 effect creating a structural genomics map of the corona virus and making thisdata open and available to researchers
 everywhere we talked about the biology of covert 19 SARS and viruses in generaland how computational methods can help
 us understand their structure and function in order to develop antiviraldrugs and vaccines this conversation was
 recorded recently in the time of the corona virus pandemic for everyonefeeling the medical psychological and
 financial burden of this crisis I'm sending love your way stay strongwe're in this together we'll beat this

 world and now here's my conversation with Demetri korkin do you find virusesterrifying or fascinating when I think


0:02:37
Speaker 0 :about viruses I think about them I mean
 I imagine them as those villains that do their work so perfectly well that's thatis impossible not to be fascinated with


0:02:57
Speaker 1 :them so what do you imagine when you
 think about a virus do you imagine the individual so these hundred nanometerparticle things or do you imagine the
 whole pandemic like Society level the when you say the efficiency at whichthey do their work do you think of
 viruses as the millions that him and that occupy human body or a livingorganism Society level like spreading as
 a pandemic or do you think of the

0:03:27
Speaker 0 :individual little guy yes this is I
 think this is a unique a unique concept that allows you to move from micro scaleto the macro scale all right so the
 dividers itself I mean it's it's not a living organismit's a machine to me it's a machine but
 it is perfected to the way that it essentially has a limited number offunctions it needs to do necessary some
 functions and essentially has enough information just to do those functionsas well as the ability to modify itself
 so you know it's it's a machine it's an

0:04:17
Speaker 1 :intelligent machine so yeah look maybe
 on that point you're in danger of reducing the power of this thing bycalling it a machine right but you now
 mention that it's also possibly intelligent it seems that there's theseelements of brilliance that a virus has
 of intelligence of maximizing so many things about its behavior in to ensure

0:04:44
Speaker 0 :

0:04:45
Speaker 1 :its survival and its and its success so
 do you see it as intelligent so you know

0:04:50
Speaker 0 :I think the it's a different
 understanding differently than you know I think about you know intelligence overhuman kind or intelligence of of the of
 the you know of the artificial intelligence mechanismsI think the intelligence of a virus is
 in its simplicity the ability to do so much with so littlematerial and information but also I
 think it's it's interesting it keeps me thinking you know it gives me wonderingwhether or not it's also the an example
 of the basic swarm intelligence where you know essentially the viruses act asthe whole and extremely efficient in
 that so what do you attribute the

0:06:01
Speaker 1 :incredible simplicity and the efficiency
 - is it the evolutionary process - maybe another way to ask that if you look atthe next hundred years
 are you more worried about the natural pandemics or the engineered pandemics sohow hard is it to build a virus yes it's


0:06:22
Speaker 0 :it's a very very interesting
 question because obviously there is a lot of conversations about the you knowwhether we are capable of engineering a
 you know anyone worse the virus I personally expect in a mostlyconcerned with the naturally occurring
 viruses simply because we keep seeing that we keep seeing new strains ofinfluenza emerging some of them becoming
 pandemic we keep seeing new strains of coronaviruses emerging this is a naturalprocess and I think this is why it's so
 powerful you know if you ask me you know did I've read papers about scientiststrying to study the capacity of the
 modern you know by technology to alter the viruses but I hope that that youknow it in it won't be our main concern
 in the near future

0:07:48
Speaker 1 :

0:07:49
Speaker 0 :do you mean by hope well you know if you
 look back and look at the history of the of the most dangerous viruses right sothat's the first thing that comes into
 mind is a smallpox so right now there is perhaps a handful of places where thisyou know the the strains of this virus
 are stored right so this is essentially the effort of the whole society to limitthe access to those viruses I mean in a


0:08:31
Speaker 1 :lab in a controlled environment in order
 to study and then smallpox is one of the

0:08:38
Speaker 0 :viruses for which


0:08:39
Speaker 1 :should be stated there's a vaccine is


0:08:42
Speaker 0 :developed yes yes and that's you know
 it's until seventies it wasn't in my opinion it was perhaps the mostdangerous think that was there is there


0:08:56
Speaker 1 :a very different virus then then the


0:09:02
Speaker 0 :influenza and coronaviruses it is it is
 different in several aspects biologically it's a so-calleddouble-stranded DNA virus but also in
 the way that it is much more contagious so they are not for so this is this isthe what are not are not is essentially
 an average number as person infected by the virus can spread to other people sothen the average number of people that
 he or she can spread it to and you know the there is still some you knowdiscussion about the estimates of the
 current virus you know the estimations vary between you know one point five andthree in case of smallpox it was five to
 seven and we're talking about the exponential growth right so that'sthat's a very big difference it's not
 the most contagious one measles for example it's I think 15 and up so soit's it's you know but it's definitely
 definitely more contagious that that the seasonal flu thenthe current coronavirus were stars for


0:10:47
Speaker 1 :that matter so what makes a what makes a
 virus more contagious or the I'm sure there's a lot of variables that comeinto play but is it is it that whole
 discussion of aerosol and like the size of droplets if if it's airborne orthere's some other stuff that's more


0:11:04
Speaker 0 :biology centered I mean there are a lot
 of components and and there are biological components that there arealso you know social components the
 ability of the virus to you know the the ways in which the virus is spread isdefinitely one the ability to virus to
 stay on the surfaces to survive the ability of the virus to replicate fast

0:11:34
Speaker 1 :also you know once it's in the cell or


0:11:36
Speaker 0 :whatever once it's inside the host and
 interesting enough something that I think we didn't pay that much attentionto is the incubation period the were you
 know hosts are symptomatic and now it turns out that another thing that we onereally needs to take into account the
 percentage of the asymptomatic population because those people stillshared this virus and still are you know
 they still are contagious as other than

0:12:13
Speaker 1 :the Iceland study which i think is
 probably the most impressive size-wise shows 50 percent asymptomatic this virusI also recently learned the swine flu is
 like just a number of people who got infected was in the billions it was somecrazy number it was like it was like
 like 20 percent of poverty percent of population something crazy like that sothe lucky thing there is the fatality
 rate is low but the fact that a virus can just take over an entire populationso quickly


0:12:56
Speaker 0 :it's terrifying I think I mean this is
 you know that's perhaps my favorite example of a butterfly effect becauseit's really I mean it's it's even tinier
 they'd then a butterfly and look at you know and with you know if you thinkabout it right so it used to be in in
 those bad species and perhaps because of you know a couple of small changes in inthe in the viral genome his first had
 you know become capable of jumping from bats to human and then it became capableof jumping from human to human
 alright so this is this is I mean it's not even the size of a virus it's thesize of several you know several atoms
 or says you know few atoms and our sudden this change has such a major

0:13:57
Speaker 1 :impact so is that a mutation like on a
 single virus is that like so if we talk about those the the flap of a butterflywing like what's the first flap well I


0:14:07
Speaker 0 :think this is the the the mutations that
 make that made this virus capable of jumping from bat species to human and ofcourse there's you know the scientists
 are still trying to find I mean they still even trying to find the the whowas the first in fact it is the patient
 zero the first human the first human infected right I mean the fact thatthere are corona viruses different
 strains of corona viruses in various bat species I mean we know that so so we youknow viola gist absurdum they studied
 them they look at their and genomic sequences they're trying of course tounderstand what make this virus is to
 jump from from bats to human there was you know similar to that and in you knowin influenza that was I think a few
 years ago there was this you know interesting story where several groupsof scientists studying influenza virus
 essentially you know made experiments to show that this virus can jump from onespecies to another you know by changing
 I think just a couple of residues and and and of course it was verycontroversial I think there was a
 moratorium on this study for a while but then the study was released it was

0:15:46
Speaker 1 :published so that was their moratorium
 is because it shows through engineering it through modifying it you can make a

0:15:55
Speaker 0 :jump yes yeah I I personally think it is
 important to study this I mean we should be inform to should try to understand asmuch as possible in order to prevent it


0:16:11
Speaker 1 :but so then the engineering aspect there
 is can't you then just start searching because there's so many strands ofviruses out there
 can't you just search for the ones in bats that are the deadliest from thevirologist perspective and then just try
 to engineer try to see how to but see that's a there's a nice aspect to it thereally nice thing about engineering
 viruses it has the same problems nuclear weapons is it's hard for it to not onlyto mutual self-destruction so you can't
 control a virus it can't be used as a

0:16:52
Speaker 0 :weapon right yeah that's why I you know
 in the beginning I said you know I I'm hopeful because that definitely thedefinitely regulations to be needed to
 be introduced and I mean as the scientific society is we are in chargeof
 you know making the right actions making the right decisions but I think we wewill benefit tremendously by
 understanding the mechanisms by which the virus can jump by which the viruscan become more you know more more
 dangerous to humans because all this answers with you know eventually to todesigning better vaccines hopefully
 Universal vaccines right and that would be a triumph of the you know science so

0:17:56
Speaker 1 :what's the universe of vaccines is that
 something that well how universal is

0:18:02
Speaker 0 :universal well I mean you know so what's


0:18:03
Speaker 1 :the dream I guess because you kind of
 mentioned the dream of this I would be

0:18:06
Speaker 0 :extremely happy if you know we designed
 the vaccine that is able I mean I'll give you an example right so so everyyear we do a seasonal flu shot the
 reason we do it is because you know we are in the arms race you know ourvaccines are in the arms race with with
 constantly changing virus right now if theneck's pandemic influenza pandemic will
 a cure most likely this vaccine would not save us right although it's it's youknow it's the same virus might be
 different strain so if we're able to essentially design a vaccine against youknow influenza A virus no matter what's
 the strain no matter which species did jump from that would be I think thatwould be a huge huge progress and
 advancement

0:19:13
Speaker 1 :you mentioned the smallpox until the
 seventies might have been something that he would be worried the most about whatabout these days well we're sitting here
 in the middle of a cove in nineteen pandemic but these days neverthelesswhat is your biggest worry virus wise
 what are you keeping your eye are on it

0:19:36
Speaker 0 :looks like and you know based on the
 past several years of the of the new viruses emerging I think we're stilldealing with different types of
 influence I mean so so the eight seven and nine avian flu that was that emergedI think a couple of years ago in China I
 think the the mortality rate was incredible I mean it was you know Ithink above thirty percent
 you know so this is this is fuchsia I mean luckily for us this strain was notpandemic alright so it was jumping from
 birds to human but I don't think it it it was actually transmittable betweenthe humans and you know this is actually
 a very interesting question which scientists tried to understandright so the balance the delicate
 balance between the virus being very contagious right soefficient in spreading and virus to be
 very pathogenic you know causing you know harms you know and and that's totheir horse so it looks like that the
 more pathogenic the viruses the less contagious it is is that a property

0:21:13
Speaker 1 :biology or what is it was I I don't have


0:21:17
Speaker 0 :an answer to that
 and III think this is this is still an open question but you know if you lookat you know you know with the corona
 virus for example if you look at you know the the deadlier relative MerceMerce was never in a pandemic virus
 right but the you know did again the the mortality rate from nurseries far aboveyou know I think twenty or thirty
 percent so so whatever is making this

0:21:51
Speaker 1 :all happen doesn't want us dead because
 it's balancing yeah nicely I mean how do

0:22:03
Speaker 0 :you explain that one not dead yet like


0:22:05
Speaker 1 :because there's so many viruses and
 they're so good at what they do why do

0:22:13
Speaker 0 :they keep us alive I mean we will also
 have you know a lot of protection right so the immune system and so I mean we dohave you know ways to to fight against
 those viruses and I think with the I now weigh much better equipped right so withthe discoveries of vaccines and you know
 there are vaccines against the the viruses that maybe two hundred years agowould wipe us out completely but because
 of this vaccines we are actually we're capable of eradicating pretty much fullyas is the case with smallpox so if we


0:22:58
Speaker 1 :could can we go to the basics a little
 bit of the biology of the virus how does the

0:23:06
Speaker 0 :virus infect the body so I think there
 are some key steps that the virus needs to perform and of course the first onethe viral particle needs to get attached
 to the host cell in the case of corona virus there is a lot of evidence that itactually interacts in the same way of
 the as the SARS coronavirus so it gets attached to a c2 human receptor and sothere is I mean as we speak there is a
 growing number of papers suggesting it moreover a most recent I think mostrecent results suggest that this virus
 attaches more efficiently to this human receptor then SARS just a sore back off

0:24:00
Speaker 1 :so there is a family viruses the corona
 viruses and SARS whatever the heck for that respite or wherever that stands for

0:24:12
Speaker 0 :so SARS actually stands for the disease
 that you get is the syndrome of acute

0:24:20
Speaker 1 :respiratory so SARS is the first strand


0:24:23
Speaker 0 :and there's Merce Merce and there is yes
 but people scientists actually know more than three strains I mean so there isthe mhv
 strain which is considered to be a canonical model disease model in miceand so there is a lot of work done on on
 this virus because it's but he hasn't

0:24:51
Speaker 1 :jumped to humans yet no no yes it's
 fascinating so any mention a c2 so the when you say attached proteins are

0:25:06
Speaker 0 :involved yeah on both sides yes so so we
 have you know so we have this infamous spike protein on the surface of thevirion particle and
 does look like a spike and I mean that's essentially because of this protein youknow we called the coronavirus
 coronavirus so that what makes Corona on top of the surface so so this via thisprotein it actually it acts so it
 doesn't act alone it actually it makes a three copies and it's it makes so-calledtrimer so this trimer is essentially a
 functional unit a single functional unit that in starts interacting with the ACtwo receptor so this is again another
 protein that now sits on the surface of a human cell host cell I would say andthat's essentially in that way the virus
 anchors itself to the host cell because then it needs to actually it needs toget inside you know it fuses its
 membrane with the host membrane it releases the the key components itreleases its you know RNA and then
 essentially hijacks the the machinery of the cell because none of the virusesthat we know of have ribosome the the
 machinery that allows us to print out proteins so in order to print outproteins that are necessary for
 functioning of this virus it actually needs to hijack the host ribosomes the

0:26:59
Speaker 1 :virus is an RNA wrapped in a bunch of
 proteins one of which is this functional mechanism with by protein that does the

0:27:08
Speaker 0 :attachment so yeah so you know so if you
 look at this virus that there are you know several basic components right sowe start with the Spike protein this is
 not the only surface protein the the protein that lives on the surface of theviral particle there is also perhaps the
 the protein with the highest number of copies is the membrane protein so it'sessentially it forms the capsid sorry
 the envelope of the protein of the viral particle and essentially you know helpsto maintain a certain curvature helps to
 make a certain curvature then there is a another protein called envelope proteinor a protein and it it actually occurs
 in in far less quantities and still there is ongoing research what exactlydoes this protein do so these are sort
 of the three major surface proteins that you know make the divider envelope andwhen we go inside then we have another
 structural protein called nuclear protein and the the purpose of thisprotein is to protect the viral RNA it
 actually binds to the viral RNA creates a capsid and so the rest of the virusviral information is inside of this you
 know RNA and you know if you compare the amount of the genes or you know proteinsthat are made of these genes it's much
 you know it's significantly higher than of influenza virus for example influenzavirus has I think around eight or nine
 proteins where this one has at least 29

0:29:12
Speaker 1 :Wow
 that has to do with the length of the

0:29:16
Speaker 0 :RNA strand I mean so I mean so it's it
 it affects the length of the RNA strand right so so so because you essentiallyneed to have sort of the minimum amount
 of information to encode those genes how

0:29:29
Speaker 1 :

0:29:30
Speaker 0 :many proteases you say 2909 protease yes
 so this is this is you know something definitely interesting because you knowbelieve it or not
 we've been studying you know coronaviruses for over two decades we'veyet to uncover all functionalities of


0:29:52
Speaker 1 :his proteins could we maybe take a small
 tangent and can you can you say how one would try to figure out what a functionof a particular protein is so you've
 mentioned people are still trying to figure out what the function of theenvelope protein might be or what's the


0:30:12
Speaker 0 :process so this is where the research
 that computational scientists do might be of help because you know in the pastseveral decades was that we actually
 have collected a pretty decent amount of knowledge about different proteins indifferent viruses so what we can
 actually try to do and this is sort of could be sort of the our first lead to apossible function is to see whether
 those you know say we have this genome of the corona virus other of the novelcoronavirus
 and we identify the potential proteins then in order to infer the function whatwe can do can actually see whether those
 proteins are similar to those ones that we already know okay in such a way wecan you know for example clearly
 identified you know some critical components that RNA polymerase ordifferent types of proteases these are
 the proteins that essentially clip the protein sequences and so this works inmany cases however in some cases you
 have truly novel proteins and this is a much more difficult task now as a small

0:31:40
Speaker 1 :pause when you say similar like what if
 some parts are different and some parts are similar like how do you disentanglethat


0:31:51
Speaker 0 :you know it's it's a big question of
 course you know what by informatics does it does predictions right so thosepredictions and they have to be
 validated by experiments functional or

0:32:05
Speaker 1 :

0:32:07
Speaker 0 :structural predictions both I mean we we
 do structural predictions with the functional predictions we dointeractions predictions things you just


0:32:14
Speaker 1 :generate a lot of predictions like
 reasonable predictions based on structure and function interaction likeyou said and then here you go
 that's the power of bioinformatics is data grounded good predictions of what

0:32:32
Speaker 0 :should happen so we you know in the way
 I see it we're helping experimental scientists to streamline the discovery

0:32:42
Speaker 1 :process yeah and the experimental
 scientists is that what a virologist is

0:32:46
Speaker 0 :solely about virology is one of the
 experimental sciences that you know focus on viruses they often work withother experimental scientists for
 example the molecular imaging scientists right so the the viruses often can beviewed and reconstructed through
 electron microscopy techniques so but these are you know specialists that arenot necessarily by biologists they've
 worked with small small particles more by whether it's viruses or is it anorganelle of a you know of a human cell
 whether it's a you know complex molecular machinery so the techniquesthat are use are very similar in in
 surfing in its in their essence and so yeah so so typically me and in we see itnow the research on you know that is
 emerging and that is needed often involves thecollaborations between biologists you
 know biochemist you know people from frompharmaceutical sciences computational
 sciences so we have to work together so

0:34:19
Speaker 1 :from my perspective is to step back
 sometimes I look at this stuff it's the how much we understand about RNA DNA howmuch we understand about protein like
 your work the amount of proteins that you're exploring is it surprising to youthat we were able we descendants of apes
 were able to figure all of this out like how so your computer scientists so forme from computer science perspective I I
 know how to write a Python program things are clear but biology is a giantmess it feels like to me from an
 outsider's perspective is how surprising is it amazing is it that we were able tofigure this stuff out you know if you


0:35:03
Speaker 0 :look at the you know how computational
 science and computer science was evolving right I think it was just amatter of time that we would approach
 biology so so we we started from you know applications to much morefundamental systems physics you know and
 now we are or you know small chemical compounds right so now we areapproaching the more complex biological
 systems and I think it's a natural evolution of you know of the computerscience of mathematics sure that's the


0:35:48
Speaker 1 :computer science I just might even in in
 higher level so that to me surprising that computer science can offer help inthis messy world but I just mean it's
 incredible that the biologists and the chemists can figure all this out or isit you sound ridiculous to you that
 that of course they would it just seems like a very complicated set of problemslike the the variety of the kinds of
 things that could be produced in the body the just just like you said 20 andI approach I mean just getting a hand of
 in a hang of it so quickly it just seems

0:36:26
Speaker 0 :impossible to me I agree I mean it's and
 I have to say we are you know in the very very beginning of this journey Imean we we've yet to I mean we've yet to
 comprehend not even try to understand and figure out all the details but we'veyet to comprehend the complexity of the


0:36:51
Speaker 1 :cell we know that neuroscience is not
 even at the beginning of understanding human mind

0:36:58
Speaker 0 :

0:36:59
Speaker 1 :so where's biology said in terms of
 understanding the function deeply understanding the function of virusesand cells so there sometimes it's easy
 to say when you talk about function what you really refer to it's perhaps not adeep understanding but more of a
 understanding sufficient to be able to mess with it using a antiviral like messwith it chemically to prevent some of
 its function or do you understand the

0:37:31
Speaker 0 :function well I think equally I think
 we're much farther in terms of understanding of the complex geneticdisorders such as cancer where you have
 layers of complexity and we you know as in my laboratory we're trying tocontribute to that research but we're
 also in a way overwhelmed with how many different layers of complexity differentlayers of mechanisms that can be
 hijacked by cancer simultaneously and so you know I think biology in the past 20years again from the perspective of the
 outsider because I'm not a biologist but I think it has advanced tremendouslyand one thing that we're computational
 scientists and data scientists are now becoming very very helpful is in thefact it's kind of from the fact that we
 are now able to generate a lot of information about the cell whether it'snext-generation sequencing or
 transcriptomics whether it's life imaging information where it is you knowcomplex interactions between proteins or
 between proteins and small molecules such as drugs we we are becoming veryefficient in generating this information
 and now the next step is to become equally efficient in processing thisinformation and extracting the the key
 knowledge from that they could then be

0:39:20
Speaker 1 :validated with the experiment yeah yeah
 so maybe then going all the way back we're talking you said the first step isseeing if we can match the new proteins
 you found in the virus against something we've seen before to figure out itsfunction and then you also mentioned
 that but there could be cases where it's a totally new protein is there somethingbiron firm addicts can offer when it's a


0:39:47
Speaker 0 :totally new protein this is where many
 of the methods and you probably are aware of you know the the case ofmachine learning many of these methods
 rely on the previous knowledge right so things that where we try to do fromscratch are incredibly difficult you
 know something that we call a Benicia and this is I mean it's not just thefunction I mean you know we've yet to
 have a robust method to predict the structures of these proteins in aBenicia you know by not using any
 templates of other related proteins so protein is

0:40:32
Speaker 1 :a chain of amino acids residues as


0:40:35
Speaker 0 :

0:40:37
Speaker 1 :residues yeah and then however somehow
 magically maybe you can tell me they seem to fold in incredibly weird and

0:40:48
Speaker 0 :

0:40:50
Speaker 1 :complicated 3d shapes yes so and that's
 where actually the idea of protein folding or just not the idea but theproblem of figuring out how the hell it
 wants up the concept how they fold into those weird shapes comes in so that'sanother side of computational work so
 what can you describe what protein folding from the computational side isand maybe your thoughts on the folding
 at home efforts that a lot of people know they you can use your machine to todo protein folding


0:41:22
Speaker 0 :so yeah broad protein folding is you
 know one of that those 1 million dollar price challenges right so the reason forthat is we've yet to understand
 precisely how the protein gets folded so efficiently to the point that in manycases where you you know where you try
 to unfold it due to the high temperature it actually folds back into its originalstate right so we know a lot about the
 mechanisms right but put putting those mechanisms together and making senseit's a computationally very expensive


0:42:10
Speaker 1 :task in general the proteins fold can
 they fold in arbitrary large number of ways it is they usually fold in a very

0:42:19
Speaker 0 :small number no it's it's typically I
 mean you we tend to think that you know there is a one sort of canonical foldfor protein although that there are many
 cases where the proteins you know upon the stabilization it can be folded intoa different conformation
 and this is especially true when you look at sort of proteins that in thatinclude more than one structural unions
 so those structural unions we call them protein domains essentially proteindomain is a single unit that typically
 is evolutionary preserved that typically carries out the single function andtypically has a very distinct fault
 structure 3d structure organization but turns out that if you look at human anaverage protein in a human cell would
 have to a bit of two or three such subunit and how they are trying to foldinto the sort of you know next level
 fold right

0:43:30
Speaker 1 :so within subunit is folding and then


0:43:33
Speaker 0 :and then they fold into the larger 3d


0:43:38
Speaker 1 :structure right and and all that there's
 some wonder saying the basic mechanisms but not to put together to be able to

0:43:44
Speaker 0 :fold it we're still I mean we're still
 struggling I mean we're we're getting pretty good about folding relativelysmall proteins up to hundred residues
 which I mean but we're still far away from folding you know larger proteinsand some of them are notoriously
 difficult for example transmembrane proteins proteins that that sit in thein the membranes of the cell they're
 incredibly important but they are incredibly difficult to solve and so

0:44:19
Speaker 1 :basically there's a lot of degrees of
 freedom how it folds and so it's a combinatorial problem or just explodesthere's so many dimensions Hey well it


0:44:28
Speaker 0 :is a combinatorial problem but it
 doesn't mean that we cannot approach it from the non canal not from the boot fora force approach and so the machine
 learning approaches you know have been emerged that try to tackle it so folding

0:44:47
Speaker 1 :at home
 I don't know how familiar with it but is that used machine learning or is it more

0:44:54
Speaker 0 :brute force no so folding at home it was
 originally and I remember I was a it was a long time ago I was a postdoc and wewe learned about this you know this game
 because it was originally designed as the game and we you know I took a lookat it and it's interesting because it's
 it's really you know it's very transparent very intuitive so and fromwhat I heard a via to introduce it to my
 son but you know kids are actually getting very good at folding theproteins and it was you know it came to
 me as they as the not as a surprise but actually as the sort of manifest of youknow our capacity to do this kind of to
 solve these kind of problems when a paper was published published in one ofthese top journals with the coasters
 been the actual players of this game so and what happened is was that theymanaged to get better structures than
 the scientists themselves so so that you know that was very I mean it was kind ofprofound you know revelation that
 problems that are so challenging for a computational science maybe not thatchallenging for a human brain well


0:46:38
Speaker 1 :that's a really good that's a hopeful
 message always when there's a the proof of existence the existence proof thatit's possible that's really interesting
 but the it seems what are the best ways to do protein folding now so if you lookat what deep mind does with alpha fall
 alpha fold yes so they kind of is that's a learning approach what's your sense Imean your backgrounds in machine
 learning but is this a learnable problem is this still a brute-force away in thegarry kasparov deep blue days are we in
 the alphago playing the game of go days

0:47:24
Speaker 0 :of folding well I think we are we are
 advancing towards this direction I mean if you look so there is a sort ofolympic game for protein folders called
 CASP and it's essentially it's you know it's a competition where different teamsare given exactly the same protein
 sequences and they try to predict their structures right and of course there'sdifferent sort of subtasks but in the
 recent competition half a fault was among the top performing teams if notthe top performing team so there is
 definitely a benefit from the data that had been generated you know in the pastseveral decades the structural data and
 certainly you know we are now at the capacity to summarize this data togeneralize this data and to use those
 principles you know in order to predict protein structures as one of the really

0:48:34
Speaker 1 :cool things here is there's maybe you
 can comment on it there seems to be these open datasets of protein how did

0:48:44
Speaker 0 :that with the protein databank


0:48:45
Speaker 1 :the a protein databank I mean as create
 is this a recent thing for just the

0:48:52
Speaker 0 :corona virus or it's it's been for many
 many years I believe the first protein databank was designed on flash cards soon the so yes it's so this I mean this
 is a great example of the community effortsof everyone contributing cause every
 time you solve a protein or a protein complex this is where you submit it andyou know the scientists get access to it
 scientists get to test it and we went from occasions use this information toyou know to make predictions so there's


0:49:41
Speaker 1 :no there's no culture like hoarding
 discoveries here so that's I mean you've you've you've released a few or a bunchof proteins they were matching its
 whatever we'll talk about details a little bit but it's kind of amazing thatthat's the the it's kind of amazing how


0:50:06
Speaker 0 :open the culture here is it is and I
 think this pandemic actually demonstrated the ability of scientificcommunity to you know to solve this
 challenge collaboratively and this is I think it if anything it actually movedus to a brand new level of
 collaborations of the efficiency in which people establish newcollaborations in in which people offer
 their help to each other scientists offer their help to each other and

0:50:44
Speaker 1 :publish results to it's very interesting
 we're now trying to figure out as a few journals that are trying to sort of dothe very accelerated review cycle but so
 many preprints so just hosting a paper going outI think it's fundamentally changing the
 the way we think about papers yes I mean

0:51:03
Speaker 0 :the way we think about knowledge now
 let's say no yes because yes I completely agree I think now it's theknowledge
 is becoming sort of the the core value not the paper or the journal where thisknowledge is published and I think this
 is again this is we are living in the in the times where it becomes reallycrystallized that the idea that the most
 important value is in the knowledge so

0:51:43
Speaker 1 :maybe you can comment like what do you
 think the future of that knowledge sharing looks like so you have thispaper that will I hope you get a chance
 to talk about a little bit but it has like a really nice abstract and theintroduction and related like it has all
 the usual I mean probably took a long time to put together so but is thatgoing to remain like you could have
 communicated a lot of fundamental ideas here in much shorter amount that's lesstraditionally acceptable by the journal


0:52:15
Speaker 0 :context so so well you know so the first
 version that we posted not even on a bi archive because by archive back then itwas essentially you know overwhelmed
 with the number of submissions so so our submission I think it took five or sixdays to just for it to be screened and
 and and put online so we you know essentially we put the first pre pre n'ton our website and you know it was
 started getting accessed right away so and and you know so this originalpreprint was in a much rougher shape
 than this paper and but we tried I mean we honestly try to be as compact aspossible with you know
 introducing the the information that is necessary that to explain our you knowour results so maybe you can dive right


0:53:26
Speaker 1 :in if it's okay sure so it's a paper
 called structured of Tsarskoe how do you even pronounce

0:53:35
Speaker 0 :

0:53:37
Speaker 1 :our scurvy - Co V - yeah by The Cove it


0:53:38
Speaker 0 :

0:53:39
Speaker 1 :is such a terrible name but it stuck
 and yes Tsarskoe V - indicates evolutionary conserved functionalregions of viral proteins so this is
 looking at all kinds of proteins that are part of the this novel coronavirusand how they match up against the
 previous other kinds of corona viruses and there's a lot of beautiful figures Iwas wondering if you could I mean
 there's so many questions I could ask her but maybe a tough how do you getstarted at doing this paper so how do
 you start to figure out the 3d structure of a novel virus yes so there is

0:54:16
Speaker 0 :actually a little story behind it and so
 the story actually dated back in September of 2019 and you probablyremember that back then we had another
 dangerous virus Triple E virus its eastern equine encephalitis virus and

0:54:40
Speaker 1 :can you maybe linger in it I have to
 admit I was sadly completely unaware so

0:54:46
Speaker 0 :so that was actually a virus outbreak
 that happened in New England only the the danger in this virus was that itactually it targeted your brain so so
 the word deaths from this virus it was it was transferred you know transfer themain vector was mosquitoes and obviously
 full-time is you know the time where you have a lot of them in New England andyou know on one hand people realize this
 is this is this actually very dangerous thing so it had an impact on the localeconomy the schools were closed past six
 o'clock no activities outside for the kids because the kids were sufferingquite tremendously from you know what
 infected from this virus and how do I

0:55:48
Speaker 1 :not know about this was impacted it was


0:55:52
Speaker 0 :in the news I mean it was not impacted
 to to high degree in in Boston necessarily but in the Metro West areaand actually spread around I think all
 the way to New Hampshire Connecticut and

0:56:09
Speaker 1 :you mentioned affecting the brain that's
 one other comment we should make so you mentioned a AC twofor the corona virus so these viruses
 kind of attach to something in the body

0:56:23
Speaker 0 :so it essentially attaches to the to
 these proteins in those cells in the body where those proteins are expressedwhere they actually have them in in
 abundance so sometimes that could be in

0:56:36
Speaker 1 :the lungs that could be a brain that


0:56:39
Speaker 0 :could be so I think what they right now
 from what I read they have the epithelial cells inside in so did thecells essentially inside the you know
 the it's the cells that are covering the surface you know so inside the nasalsurfaces the this road the lung cells
 and I believe liver as a couple of other organs where they are actuallyexpressing in abundance that's for the


0:57:13
Speaker 1 :AC tuition for 318 two percenters okay
 so back back to the story yes in the

0:57:19
Speaker 0 :fall so now the these you know the
 impact of this virus is significant however it's a pre local problem to thepoint that you know this something that
 we would call a neglected disease because it's not big enough to make youknow the the drug design companies to
 design a new antiviral or in York seen it's not big enough to generate a lot ofgrants from the nation of finding
 agencies so so does it mean we cannot do anything about it and so what I did is Itaught a by informatics class and is in
 Worcester Polytechnic Institute and we are very much problem learninginstitution so I thought that that would
 be a perfect you know perfect project in

0:58:31
Speaker 1 :

0:58:34
Speaker 0 :case study so so I asked it you know so
 so I we essentially designed a study where we tried to use by informatics toto understand as much as possible about
 this virus and a very substantial portion of the study was to understandthe structures of the proteins to
 understand how they interact with with each other and with the with the hostproteins try to understand the evolution
 of this virus it's obviously you know a very importantquestion how where it will evolve
 further how you know how it happened here you know so so we did all this youknow
 projects and now I'm trying to put them into a paper where all theseundergraduate students will be coasters
 but essentially the projects were finished right about mid-december and acouple of weeks later I heard about this
 mysterious new virus that was discovered in you know was reported in in Wuhanprovince and immediately I thought that
 well we just did that can't we do the same thing with this virus and so westarted waiting for the genome to be
 released because that's essentially the first piece of information that iscritical once you have the genome
 sequence you can doing a lot using my informatics when

1:00:13
Speaker 1 :you see genome sequence that's referring
 to the sequence of letters that make up

1:00:20
Speaker 0 :the RNA so the sequence that make up the
 entire information encoded in the protein right so so that includes all 29genes


1:00:34
Speaker 1 :what are genes what's the encoding of


1:00:38
Speaker 0 :information sosigenes is essentially is
 a basic functional unit that we can consider so so each gene in the viruswould correspond to a protein that so
 gene by itself doesn't do it function it needs to be converted or translated intothe protein that will become the actual
 functional unit like you said the

1:01:07
Speaker 1 :

1:01:09
Speaker 0 :printer so so we need the printer for


1:01:11
Speaker 1 :that we need to print it okay so the the
 first step is to figure out that the genome the sequence of things that to bethen used for printing the protein so


1:01:22
Speaker 0 :okay so then then the next step so once
 we have this and so we use the existing information about Sarkis the Czar'sgenomics has been done in abundance so
 we have different strains of SARS and actually other related coronavirusesMERS the bat coronavirus and we started
 by identifying the potential genes because right now it's just the sequenceright it's a sequence that is roughly
 it's less than 30,000 nucleotide long and this the raw sequence it's a rose

1:02:06
Speaker 1 :

1:02:08
Speaker 0 :ignore the information really and we now
 need to define the boundaries of the genesthat would then be used to identify the
 proteins and protein structures how hard

1:02:22
Speaker 1 :

1:02:23
Speaker 0 :is that problem it's not I mean it's
 pretty straightforward so you know so because we use theexisting information about SARS proteins
 and SARS genes

1:02:35
Speaker 1 :so once again we kind of we are relying


1:02:37
Speaker 0 :on the yes so and then once we get there
 this is where sort of the first more traditional bind phonetic steps stepbegins we are trying to use these
 protein sequences and get the 3d information about those proteins so thisis where we are relying heavily on the
 structure information specifically from the protein data bank that we aretalking about and here you're looking


1:03:15
Speaker 1 :

1:03:18
Speaker 0 :for similar proteins yes so so the the
 concept that we are operating when we do this kind of modeling it's calledhomology or template based modeling so
 essentially using the concept that if you have two sequences that are similarin terms of the letters the structures
 of these sequences are expected to be

1:03:44
Speaker 1 :similar as well and this is at the micro
 at a very local scale and at the scale

1:03:48
Speaker 0 :of the whole protein at the whole
 protein I saw actually so you know so of course the devil is any details and thisis why we need actually pre
 sophisticated modeling tools to do so once we get these structures of theindividual proteins we try to see
 whether or not this proteins act alone or they have to be forming proteincomplexes in order to perform this
 function and again so this is sort of the next level of the modeling becausenow you need to understand how proteins
 interact and it could be the case that the protein interacts with itself andmakes sort of a multi marek complex the
 same protein just repeated multiple times and we have quite quite a few suchproteins in Tsarskoe v2 specifically
 spike protein needs three copies to function and load protein needs fivecopies to function and there are some
 other multimeric complexes that we mean

1:05:18
Speaker 1 :by interacted with itself and you see
 multiple copy so how do you how do you make a good guess whether something's

1:05:26
Speaker 0 :going to interact well again so there
 are two approaches right so one is look at the previously solved complexes nowwe're looking not at the individual
 structures but the structures of the

1:05:40
Speaker 1 :whole complex complex is upon multiple


1:05:43
Speaker 0 :proteins yes so it's a bunch of proteins
 essentially glued together and and when

1:05:47
Speaker 1 :you say glued that's the interaction


1:05:49
Speaker 0 :that's the interaction so so the
 different forces different sort of physical forces behind this as I

1:05:57
Speaker 1 :certainly keep asking dumb questions but
 is it is the glue is that the interaction fundamentally structural oris it functional like in the way you're


1:06:09
Speaker 0 :thinking about it that's actually a very
 good way to ask this question because turns out that the interaction isstructural but in the way it forms this
 truck it actually also carries out thefunction so interaction is often needed
 to carry out very specific function or

1:06:35
Speaker 1 :protein but in terms of an earth-sized
 figuring out you're really starting at the structure before you figure out thefunction so there's a beautiful figure
 two in the paper of all the different proteins that make up the able to figureout the makeup the the new the novel


1:06:58
Speaker 0 :current virus what what are we looking


1:06:59
Speaker 1 :at right so these are like that's this


1:07:03
Speaker 0 :

1:07:05
Speaker 1 :through the the step to the mentioned
 when you try to guess at the possible proteins that's what you're going to getis these blue blue cyan blobs yes so


1:07:16
Speaker 0 :those are the individual proteins for
 which we have at least some information from the previous studies right so thereis advantage and disadvantage of using
 previous studies the biggest well the disadvantage is that you know we may notnecessarily have the coverage of all 29
 proteins however the biggest advantage is that the accuracy in which we canmodel these proteins is very high much
 higher compared to a Benicia methods that do not use any template information

1:07:56
Speaker 1 :so but nevertheless this figure also has
 incision beautiful and I love these pictures so much you've as it has likethe pink parts yes there are the parts
 that are different so you're highlighting so the difference you findis on the 2d sequence and then you try
 to infer what I would look like on the

1:08:18
Speaker 0 :3d yeah so the difference actually is on


1:08:23
Speaker 1 :1d sequence one d1 design idea so and


1:08:24
Speaker 0 :and so this is one of these first
 questions that we try to answer is that well if you take this new virus and youtake
 the closest relatives which are SARS and a couple of bad coronavirus strains theyare already the closest relatives that
 we are aware of now what are the difference between this virus and itsclose relatives right and what if you
 look DIPA Klee when you take a sequence those differences could be quite faraway from each other so what make what
 3d structure makes those difference to do they very often they tend to clustertogether interesting and over sudden the
 differences that may look completely unrelated actually relate to each otherand sometimes they are there because
 they correspond they attack the functional side right so they are therebecause this is the functional side that
 is highly mutated so that's a

1:09:43
Speaker 1 :computational approach to figuring
 something out when when it comes together like that that's kind of a niceclean indication that there's something
 this could be actually indicative of what's what's happening yes I mean so we

1:09:58
Speaker 0 :need this information and you know 3d
 the 3d structure gives us just a very intuitive way to look at thisinformation and then start to ask you
 know start asking questions such as so this place of this protein that ishighly mutated does it does it is it the
 functional part of the protein so does this part of the protein interact withsome other protein so maybe with some
 other ligands small small molecules right so we would try now tofunctionally inform this 3d structure


1:10:51
Speaker 1 :so so you have a bunch of these mutated
 parts is like I don't know how like how many are there in the new novelcoronavirus being compared it's ours oh
 we're talking about hundreds of thousands like these these pink region

1:11:07
Speaker 0 :all know did much less than that and
 it's very interesting that if you look at that you know so the first thing thatyou you start seeing right you know you
 look at patterns right and the first pattern that becomes obvious is thatsome of the proteins in the new
 coronavirus are pretty much intact right so they're pretty much exactly the sameas SARS as the bat coronavirus
 where some others are heavily mutated so so it looks like that the you know theevolution is not is not a curing you
 know uniformly across the entire you know viral genome but actually targetvery specific proteins what do you do


1:12:02
Speaker 1 :with that like from the Sherlock Holmes


1:12:05
Speaker 0 :perspective well you know so one of the
 of the most interesting findings we had was the fact that the viral so the thebinding sites on the viral surfaces that
 get targeted by the known small molecules the world pretty much notaffected at all and so that means that
 the same small drugs or small small drug like compounds can be efficient for thenew current a virus


1:12:51
Speaker 1 :this all actually maps to the drug
 compounds - like so so you're actually mapping out what old stuff is gonna workon this thing and then possibilities for
 new stuff to work by mapping out the

1:13:07
Speaker 0 :things I've mutated yes so so we
 essentially know which parts is in behave differently and which parts arelikely to behave similar and again you
 know of course all our predictions need to be validated by experiments buthopefully that sort of helps us to
 delineate the regions of this virus that you know can be promising in terms ofthe drug discovery you kind of you kind


1:13:38
Speaker 1 :of mentioned this already but maybe you
 can elaborate so how different from this structural and functional perspectivedoes the new corona virus appear to be


1:13:52
Speaker 0 :relative to SARS we now are trying to
 understand the overall structural characteristics of this virus because Imean that's that's our next step trying
 to model the viral particle of a single viral particle of this virus so that

1:14:09
Speaker 1 :means you have the individual proteins
 you think you said you have to figure out what their interaction is as youhave this is that where this graph kind
 of interact on so so internet so so the

1:14:20
Speaker 0 :interactome at the site is essentially a
 so our prediction on the potential interactions some of them that wealready deciphered from the structural
 knowledge but some of them that essentially are deciphered from theknowledge of the existing interactions
 that people previously obtained for SARS for MERS or other related viruses so is

1:14:49
Speaker 1 :there kind of interact ohms am i
 pronouncing that correctly weather interaction yeah are those alreadyconverged towards for SARS for so do I


1:15:02
Speaker 0 :think there is there are a couple of
 papers that now investigate the sort of the large-scale set of sets ofinteractions between the new czars and
 its hosts and so I think that's that's an ongoing study I think and the success

1:15:26
Speaker 1 :of that the result would be an interact
 on yes and so when you say not trying to figureout the entire the article the entire


1:15:37
Speaker 0 :wrinkle right so if you look you know so
 structure right so what this viral particle looks like right so as I saidit's it's you know the surface of it is
 an envelope which is essentially a so-called lipid bilayer with proteinsintegrated into the surface so how so so
 an average particle is around 18 nanometers right so this particle canhave about 5,200 spike proteins so at
 least we suspect it and you know based on themicrographs images it's very comparable
 to m hv virus in mice and SARS virus

1:16:32
Speaker 1 :micrographs are actual pictures of the
 actual virus okay so these are models

1:16:38
Speaker 0 :this is that at least so they did actual
 meat images right what do they sorry for

1:16:41
Speaker 1 :the tangents but what are these things
 so when you look on the internet the models and the pictures are in pen andthe models you have here just gorgeous
 and beautiful when you actually take pictures of them or the micrograph likewhat what do we look well


1:16:56
Speaker 0 :they typically are not perfect it's also
 the most of the images that you see now is the is the sphere with those spikesyou actually see bikes yes yes you do
 see the spikes and now you know the our collaborators for Texas and I amBenjamin Moomin he actually in the
 recent paper about SARS he proposed and there is some actually evidence behindit that the particle is not a sphere but
 is actually is elongated ellipsoid like particles so so that's what we aretrying to incorporate into our model and
 the reaiiy mean you know if you look at the actual micrographs you see thatthose particles are you know are not
 symmetric so there's some of them and of course you know it could be due to thetreatment of the of the material it
 could be due to the some noise in the imaging so there's a lot of uncertainty

1:18:15
Speaker 1 :so it's okay so structurally figuring
 out the entire part by the way again sorry for the tangents but why the termparticle or is it just it's it's a


1:18:27
Speaker 0 :single you know so we could you know we
 call it the virion so very unparticle it's essentially a single virus single

1:18:35
Speaker 1 :virus but just feels like this particle
 to me from the physics perspective feels like this the most basic unit becausethere seems to be so much going on
 inside the virus yeah it doesn't feel like a particle - yes well yeah it's

1:18:51
Speaker 0 :probably I think it's the the you know
 variant is is a good way to call it so

1:18:57
Speaker 1 :okay so trying to figure out trying to
 figure out the entirety of the system

1:19:06
Speaker 0 :yes so you know so you know so this is
 so severe ian has 5,200 spikes a trimer spikes it has roughly 200 to 400membrane protein dimers and those are
 arranged in there very nice lattice so you can actually see sort of the it'sit's like a
 it's a carpet of on the surface again exactly on the surface and occasionallyyou also see this envelope protein
 inside and some of the one we don't know

1:19:44
Speaker 1 :what it does actually exactly the one


1:19:46
Speaker 0 :that that forms the pentamer this very
 nice pentameric ring and so you know so this is what we're trying to you knowwe're trying to put now all our
 knowledge together and see whether we can actually generate this overallvariant model with an idea to understand
 you know well first of all to understand how how it looks like how far it is fromthose images that were generated but I
 mean the implications are you know there is a potential for the you knownanoparticle design that will mimic this
 variant particle is the process of

1:20:35
Speaker 1 :nanoparticle design meaning artificially
 designing something that looks similar

1:20:42
Speaker 0 :yes you know so the one that can
 potentially compete with the actual variant particles and therefore reducethe effect of the infection so is this


1:20:55
Speaker 1 :the idea of like what is a vaccine so


1:20:59
Speaker 0 :vaccine vaccine so so that yes so there
 are two ways of essentially treating and in the case of vaccine is preventing theinfection so vaccine is you know a way
 to train our immune system so our immune system becomes aware of this new dangerand therefore is capable of generating
 the antibodies then we'll essentially bind to the spike proteins becausethat's the main target for the end of
 for the vaccines design and block its foundif you have the spike with the antibody
 on top and can no longer interact with a co2 receptor so the the process of

1:21:57
Speaker 1 :designing vaccine and is you have to
 understand enough about the structure the virus itself to be able to create anartificial our official particle well I


1:22:10
Speaker 0 :mean so so so the nanoparticle is is a
 very exciting and new research so there are already established ways to you knowto make vaccines and several different
 ones right so so there is one where essentially the the virus gets throughthe cell culture multiple times so it
 becomes essentially account you know adjusted to the to the specificembryonic cell and as a result become
 becomes less I you know compatible with the you know host human cells sotherefore it's sort of the idea of the
 life vaccine where the particles are there but they are not so efficient youknow so they cannot replicate you know
 as rapidly as you know before the vaccine and that they can be introducedto the immune system the immune system
 will learn and the person who gets this vaccine one won't get you know sick oryou know will have mild you know mild
 symptoms so then there is sort of different types of the way to introducethe non-functional non-functional part
 of this virus or the virus where some of the information is stripped down forexample device with no genetic material
 so so we ignore our age you know exactly so you cannot replicate it cannotessentially perform most of its


1:23:58
Speaker 1 :functions that saying well what is the
 big hurtle to design one of these to arriveone of these is it the work that you're
 doing in the fundamental understanding of this new virus or is it in the fromour perspective a complicated world of
 experimental validation and sort of showing that this like going through thewhole process of showing this is
 actually gonna work with FDA approval all that kind of stuff I think it's both

1:24:25
Speaker 0 :I mean you know our understanding of the
 molecular mechanisms will allow us to you know to design to have moreefficient designs of the vaccines
 however they once you design the vaccine it it needs to be tested but when you

1:24:42
Speaker 1 :look at the 18 months and the different
 projections which seems like an exceptionally from historically speakingmaybe you can correct me but it's even
 18 months seems like a very accelerated

1:24:55
Speaker 0 :timeline it is it is I mean I remember
 reading about the you know in a book about some previous vaccines that itcould take up to 10 years to design and
 you know properly test a vaccine before its mass production so yeah we you knoweverything is accelerated these days I
 mean for better for worse but but you know we we definitely need that well

1:25:24
Speaker 1 :especially the corner virus and in the
 scientific community is really stepping up and working together thecollaborative aspect is really
 interesting you mentioned so the vaccine is one and then there's antiviralsantiviral drugs so antiviral drugs so


1:25:36
Speaker 0 :we're you know vaccines are typically
 needed to prevent the infection right but once you have an infection one youknow so what we try to do try to stop it
 so we try to stop virus from functioning and so the antiviral drugs are designedto block some critical function of the
 of the proteins from the viral from the virus so there are a number ofinteresting candidates and I think you
 know if you ask me I you know I think remedy severeis perhaps the most promising it's it
 has been shown to be you know an efficient and effective antiviral forSARS originally it was the the antiviral
 drug developed for completely different virus I think for a ball and bar Marburg

1:26:49
Speaker 1 :and high level you know how it works so


1:26:51
Speaker 0 :it tries to mimic one of the nucleotides
 in RNA and essentially that that stops the replication from so messes I guess

1:27:05
Speaker 1 :that's what so anywhere all drugs mess
 some aspect of this yes process so you

1:27:11
Speaker 0 :know so essentially we try to stop
 certain functions of the virus there are some other ones you know that aredesigned to inhibit the protease the the
 thing that clips protein sequences there is one that was originally designed formalaria which is a bacterial you know
 bacterial disease so this is so cool so

1:27:42
Speaker 1 :but that's exactly where your work steps
 in is you're figuring out the functional then the structure these different solike providing candidates for where
 drugs can plug in exactly well yes

1:27:54
Speaker 0 :because you know one thing that we don't
 know is whether or not so let's say we have a perfect drug candidate that isefficient against SARS and again Smurfs
 now is it going to be efficient against New South Korea too we don't know thatand there are multiple aspects that can
 affect this efficiency so for instance if the the binding site so the the partof the protein where this ligand gets
 attached if this site is mutated then the ligand may not be attachable to thispart any longer and you know our work
 and the work of other by informatics groups you know essentially are tryingto understand whether or not that will
 be the case or and it looks like for for the ligands that we looked at the ligandbinding sites are pretty much intact
 which is very promising so if we can

1:29:07
Speaker 1 :just like zoom out for a second
 what are you optimistic so this - well there's three possible ends - the coronavirus pandemic so one is there's or
 drugs or vaccines get figured out very quickly probably drugs first the otheris the the the pandemic runs its course
 for this wave at least and then the the third is you know things go much worseand some in some dark bad very bad
 direction do you see let's focus on the first two do you see the anti-drugs ofthe work you're doing being relevant for


1:29:56
Speaker 0 :

1:29:57
Speaker 1 :

1:30:00
Speaker 0 :us right now in stopping the pandemic or


1:30:00
Speaker 1 :do you hope that the pandemic will run
 its course so the social distancing things likewearing masks all those discussions that
 we're having will be the the method with which we fight coronavirus in the shortterm or do you think that it'll have to


1:30:25
Speaker 0 :be antiviral drugs I think I think
 antivirals would be I would view that as the at least the short term solution Isee more and more cases in
 news of those new drug candidates been administered in hospitals and I meanthis is right now the best what we have


1:30:57
Speaker 1 :but do we need it to reopen the economy


1:30:59
Speaker 0 :I mean we definitely need it i i cannot
 sort of speculate on how that will affect reopening of the economy becausewe are you know we are kind of deep in
 into the pandemic and it's not just the the states it's also you know worldwideyou know of course you know there is
 also the possibility of the second wave as we you know as you mentioned and thisis why you know we need to be super
 careful we need to follow all the precautions that the doctors tell us to

1:31:50
Speaker 1 :do are you worried about the mutation


1:31:54
Speaker 0 :the virus so it's of course a real
 possibility now how to what extent this virus can mutate it's an open question Imean we know that it is able to mutate
 to jump from one species to another and to to become transmissible betweenhumans right so will it you know so
 let's imagine that we have the new antiviral will this virus becomeeventually resistant to this antiviral
 we don't know I mean this is what needs to be studied this is such a beautiful

1:32:37
Speaker 1 :and terrifying process that a virus some
 viruses may be able to mutate to respond to the mutate around the thing we've putbefore it can you explain that process
 like how does that happen just is that just the way of evolution I

1:32:57
Speaker 0 :would say so yes I mean it's it's the
 evolutionary mechanisms there is nothing imprinted into this virus that makes ityou know it just the way it it walls and
 actually it's the way it Cory walls with its host it's just amazing it's

1:33:18
Speaker 1 :especially the evolution mechanism is
 especially amazing given how simple the virus is it's incredible that it's Imean it's beautiful
 it's beautiful because it's the one of the cleanest examples of evolution

1:33:38
Speaker 0 :working well I think I mean the one of
 the sort of the reasons for its simplicity is because it does notrequire all the necessary functions to
 be stored right so it actually can hijack they may the majority of thenecessary function from the host cell
 and it's so so so so the ability to do so in my view reduces the complexity ofthis machine drastically although if you
 look at the you know most recent discoveries right so the scientistsdiscovered viruses that are as large as
 bacteria right so this mini viruses and Mama viruses it actually thosediscoveries made scientists to
 reconsider the origins of the virus you know and what are the mechanisms and howyou know what are the mechanisms the
 evolution mechanisms that leads to the appearance of the viruses by the way I

1:34:47
Speaker 1 :mean you did mention that viruses are I
 think you mentioned that they're now

1:34:52
Speaker 0 :living yes they are not living organisms


1:34:55
Speaker 1 :so let me ask that questioning and why
 do you think they're not living

1:35:00
Speaker 0 :organisms well because they they are
 dependent the majority of the functions of thevirus are dependent on the on the host


1:35:13
Speaker 1 :so let me do the devil's advocate let me
 be the philosophical that was advocate here and say while humans which we wouldsay our living need our host planet to
 survive so you can basically take every living organism that we think of asdefinitively living it's always going to
 have some aspects of it this host that it needs of its environment so is thatreally the key aspect of why a virus is
 that dependence because it seems to be very good at doing so many things thatwe consider to be intelligent it's just


1:36:00
Speaker 0 :that dependence part well I mean it yeah
 it's it's difficult to answer in this way I mean I the way I think about thevirus is you know in order for it to
 function it needs to have the critical component the critical tools that itdoesn't have so I mean that's that's you
 know in my way you know the it's not autonomous I sense and that that's how Iseparate the the idea of the living work
 is on a very high level yes between the living organism and and you have some no

1:36:52
Speaker 1 :we have I mean this is just terms and
 perhaps they don't mean much but we have some kind of sense of what autonomousmeans and that humans are autonomous


1:37:03
Speaker 0 :

1:37:05
Speaker 1 :you've also done excellent work in the
 epidemiological modeling the simulation of these things so the zooming outoutside of the body
 during the aging based simulation so that's where you actually simulateindividual human beings and then the
 spread of viruses from one to the other how does at a high level agent-based

1:37:33
Speaker 0 :simulation work all right so it's it's
 also one of this I irony of timing because I mean way we we've worked onthis project for the past five years and
 the New Year's Eve I got an email from my Fiji student that you know the lastexperiments were completed and you know
 the three weeks after that we get we get this diamond princess story and emailingeach other with the same you know the
 same news saying okay so the damn place

1:38:10
Speaker 1 :is a cruise ship yes and what was the
 project that you working so I project I

1:38:15
Speaker 0 :mean it's you know the codename it
 started with the bunch of undergrad use the code name was zombies on a cruiseship so they they wanted to essentially
 model the the you know zombie apocalypse apocalypses on a cruise ship and and youknow after having you know some fun we
 then thought about the fact that you know if you look at the cruise ships Imean the infectious outbreak is has been
 one of the biggest threat you know threats to the cruise ship economy soperhaps the most you know frequently
 occurring via is the normal choirs and this is essentially one of this stomachflus that you have and you know it it
 can be quite devastating you know so there are occasionally there are cruiseships get you know they get canceled
 they get returned to the back to the to the originand so we wanted to study and this is
 very different from the traditional epidemiological studies where this scaleis much larger so we wanted to study
 this in a confined environment which is a cruise ship it could be a school itcould be other you know other places
 such as you know these large large company where people are in interactionand the benefit of this model is we can
 actually track that in the real time so we can actually see the whole course ofthe evolution or the whole course of the
 interaction between the infected pass infected horse and you know the host andthe pathogen etcetera so so agent based
 system multi-agent system to be precisely is a good way to approach thisproblem because we can introduce the
 behavior of the of the passengers of the cruise and what we did for the firsttime that's where you know we introduced
 um knology is we introduced a pathogen agent explicitly so that allowed us toessentially model the behavior on the
 host site as well on the pathogen site and over sudden weekends we can have aflexible model that allows us to
 integrate all the key parameters about the infections so for example the virusright so the ways of of transmitting the
 virus between the the horse how long does virus survive on thesurface for might what is you know how
 much of the viral particles does a host shed when he or she is asymptomaticversus symptomatic you can encode all of


1:42:03
Speaker 1 :that into this pattern just for people
 who don't know so agent-based simulation usually the agent represents a singlehuman being and then there's some graphs
 like contact graphs that represent the interaction between those human being so

1:42:19
Speaker 0 :yes so we so essentially is you know
 social agents are you know individual programs that are run in parallel andwe're saying we can provide instructions
 for these agents how to interact with each other how to exchange informationin this case exchange the infection but


1:42:46
Speaker 1 :in this case in your case you've added a
 pathogen as an Asian I mean that's kind of fascinating it's a it's kind of abrilliant simple like a brilliant way to
 condense the parameters to aggregate to bring the parameters together thatrepresent them in the pathogen the virus
 yes that's fascinating

1:43:07
Speaker 0 :actually so yeah it was a you know we
 realized that you know by bringing in the virus we can actually start modelingI mean we were not no longer bounded by
 very specific sort of aspects of the specific virus so we end up we startedwith you know Norwalk virus and of
 course zombies but we continued to modeling Ebola virus outbreak flu SARSand because I felt that we need to add a
 little bit more of excitement for our undergraduatestudents so we actually modeled the
 virus from the contagion movie yes so MeV won and you know unfortunatelythat virus and we we try to extract as
 much information luckily the this movie was the scientific consultant was IanLipkin a virologist from Columbia
 University who is actually who provided I think he designed this virus for thismovie based on Nipah virus and I think
 with some ideas behind source of flu like airborne viruses and you know theit the movie surprisingly contained
 enough details for us to extract and to model it I was hoping you'd like publish

1:44:44
Speaker 1 :a paper of how this virus works


1:44:47
Speaker 0 :yeah we're planning to publish I would


1:44:50
Speaker 1 :love it if you guys will be nice if the
 you know of the origin of the virus but you're now actually being a scientistand studying the virus from that
 perspective but the origin of the virus

1:45:01
Speaker 0 :you do you know you know the first time
 actually so this movie is assignment number one in my band families classthat they give because it it also tell
 it tells you that you know by informatics can be of use because if ifI don't know you watch the have you
 watched it a long time so so there is you know approximately a week from theyou know virus detection we see a
 screenshot of scientists looking at the structure of the surface protein andthis is where I tell my students that
 you know if you ask experimental biologists they will tell you that it'simpossible because it takes months maybe
 years to get the crystal structure of this you know the structure that isrepresented if you ask you buy from a
 Titian they tell you why not just get it modeled and and yesbut it was very interesting to to see
 that there is actually you know and if you do it do screenshots you actuallysee they feel a genetic tree is the
 evolutionary tree that relate this virus with other viruses so it was a lot ofscientific thought put into the movie
 and one thing that I was actually you know it was interesting to to learn isthat the origin of this virus was a
 there were two animals that led to the you know the the the you know thezoonotic original dis virus were fruit
 bat and as a peak so you know so so this

1:46:55
Speaker 1 :is this doesn't feel like well this this
 definite views like we're living in a simulation okay but maybe a big pictureagent-based simulation now larger scale
 sort of not focused on a cruise ship a larger scale are used now to drive somepolicy so politicians use them to tell
 stories and narratives and try to figure out how how to move forward and there'sso much so much uncertainty but in your
 sons are agent-based simulation useful for actually predicting the future orare they useful mostly for comparing
 relative comparison of different intervention methods well I think both

1:47:38
Speaker 0 :because you know in the case of new
 coronavirus we essentially learning that the current intervention methods may notbe efficient enough one thing that one
 important aspect that I find to be so critical and yet something thatwas over looked you know during the past
 pandemics is the effect of the symptomatic period this virus isdifferent because it has such a long
 symptomatic period and over sudden that creates a completely new game whentrying to contain this virus it enters


1:48:35
Speaker 1 :the dynamics of the infection exactly I
 do also I don't know how close you're tracking this but do you also think thatthere's a different like rate of
 infection from when you're asymptomatic like that that aspect or does a virus

1:48:55
Speaker 0 :not care so there were a couple of works
 so one important parameter that tells us how contagious the the person with asymptomatic device versus are
 symptomatic is looking at the number of viral particles this person sheds youknow as a function of time so so far
 what I saw is the study that tells us that the you know the person during theasymptomatic period is already
 contagious and it said the person says enough viruses to infect yeah andanother horse and I think there's too


1:49:48
Speaker 1 :many excellent papers coming up but I
 think I just saw so maybe a nature paper that said the first week is when you'resymptomatic or asymptomatic you're the
 most contagious so the highest level of the like there's a plot sort of in the14-day period they collected a bunch of
 subjects and I think the first week is one is the most yeah I I think I mean

1:50:12
Speaker 0 :I'm waiting I'm waiting to see sort of
 more more populated studies where I just it was kindamy one of my favorite styles was again
 very recent one where scientists determined that tears are not contagiousso so there is you know so there is no
 viral shedding down through three tears

1:50:46
Speaker 1 :so they found one wick moist thing
 that's not contagious and I mean there's a lot of I'm personally been I'm gonnaserve a paper somehow that's looking at
 masks and there's been so much interesting debate on the efficacy ofmasks and there's a lot of work and
 there's a lot of interesting work on whether this virus is airborne and it'sa totally open question is it's leaning
 one way right now but it's a totally open question whether it can travel andaerosols long distances I mean do you
 have us do you think about the stuff do you track this stuff are you focused onthem yeah I mean I'm at it I mean did


1:51:28
Speaker 0 :this is this is a very important aspect
 for our epidemiology study I think the I mean and it's sort of a very simple sortof idea but I agree with people who say
 that they mask the masks work in both stay in both ways so it not only itprotects you from the you know incoming
 viral particles it also protect you know it it you know makes the potentiallycontagious person not to spread the
 right of party noise when they're

1:52:12
Speaker 1 :asymptomatic may not even know that
 they're in fact it seems to be there's evidence that they don't surgical andcertainly homemade masks which is what's
 needed now actually because there's a huge shortage of they don't work as toprotect you that while they work much
 better to protect others it's it's a motivation for us to all wear one

1:52:37
Speaker 0 :exactly because I mean you know very you
 don't know where you know inside you know about 30% as far as I remember atleast 30% of the asymptomatic cases are
 completely asymptomatic here right so you don't really care you don't I meanyou don't have any symptoms yet you shed
 viruses do you think it's possible that

1:52:59
Speaker 1 :we'll all wear masks so I wore masks at
 a grocery store and you just you get looks I mean it was like we could gomaybe it's already changed because I
 think CDC or somebody's I think the CDC has said that we should be wearing maskslike la they starting to happen but you
 it just seems like something that this country will really struggle doing or no

1:53:23
Speaker 0 :I hope not I mean you know it it was
 interesting I was looking through the through the old pictures during theSpanish flu and you could see that the
 you know pretty much everyone was wearing masks with some exceptions andthey were like you know sort of iconic
 photograph of the thing it was San Francisco this tram who was refusing tolet in a you know someone without the
 mask so I think well you know it's also you know it's related to the fact youknow how much we are scared right so how
 much do we treat this problem seriously and you know my take on it is we shouldbecause it is very serious


1:54:28
Speaker 1 :yeah I i from a psychology perspective
 just worried about the entirely the entire big mess the of a psychologyexperiment that this is whether masks
 will help it or heard it you know the masks have a way of distancing us fromothers by removing the emotional
 and all that kind of stuff but at the same time masks also signal that I careabout your well-being exactly so it's a
 really interesting trade-off that's just uh yeah it's it's interesting right

1:55:02
Speaker 0 :about distancing uh aren't we distance
 enough right exactly

1:55:09
Speaker 1 :Hey and when we tried to come closer
 together when they do reopen the economy that's going to be a long road ofrebuilding trust and not not all being
 huge germophobes let me ask sort of you

1:55:27
Speaker 0 :

1:55:27
Speaker 1 :have a bit of a Russian accent Russian
 or no Russian accent uh were you born in

1:55:35
Speaker 0 :Russia yes and the you you're too kind
 I have a pre thick Russian accent what

1:55:42
Speaker 1 :are your favorite memories of Russia so


1:55:44
Speaker 0 :I so I moved first to Canada and then to
 the United States back in 99 so by that time I was 22 so you know whateverRussian accent III got back then you
 know it's that use me for the rest of my lifeyou know it's yeah so I you know by the
 time the Soviet Union collapsed I was you know I was a kid but through youknow old enough to to realize that there
 are changes and did you want to be a

1:56:29
Speaker 1 :scientist back then oh yes oh yeah I


1:56:31
Speaker 0 :mean my first the first sort of ten
 years of my sort of you know a juvenile life I wanted to be a pilot of apassenger jet plane Wow
 so yes it was like you know I was getting ready you know to go to acollege to get the degree but
 I've been always fascinated by science and you know so not just by mass ofcourse math was one of my favorite
 subjects but you know biology chemistry physics somehow I you know I liked thosefour subjects together and guess so so
 so essentially after a certain period of time I wanted to actually back then itwas a very popular sort of area of
 science called cybernetics so it's sort of it's not really computer science butit's it was like you know computation or
 robotics yes in this sense and so I really wanted to do that and but thenyou know I you know I realized that you
 know my biggest passion was in mathematics and later I you know whenyou know studying in Moscow State
 University I also realized that I really want to apply the the knowledge so Ireally wanted to to mix you know the
 mathematical knowledge that I get with real-life problems and that could be you

1:58:32
Speaker 1 :mentioned chemistry and now biology and
 I sort of does it make you sad maybe I'm wrong on this but it seems like it's

1:58:46
Speaker 0 :

1:58:47
Speaker 1 :difficult to be in collaboration to do
 open big science in Russia from my distant perspective in computer scienceI don't I'm not like we can go to
 conferences in Russia I sadly don't have many collaborators in Russia I don'tknow many people doing great
 a I work in Russia does it make does that make you sadam I wrong and seeing it this way well I


1:59:15
Speaker 0 :mean I am
 I have to tell you I am privileged to to have collaborators in biometrics inRussia and I think this is the divine
 thematic school in Russia is very strong we have in Moscow in Moscow inNovosibirsk in st. Petersburg have great
 collaborators in cousin and so at least you know in terms of you know my area ofresearch strongly people there


1:59:52
Speaker 1 :

1:59:52
Speaker 0 :yes strong people a lot of great ideas
 very open to collaborations so I perhaps you know it's my luck but you know Ihaven't experienced you know any
 difficulties in establishing collaborationsthat's why informatics it could be bad


2:00:15
Speaker 1 :from a text to an ink yeah it's it could
 be person by person related but I just don't feel the warmth and love that I

2:00:24
Speaker 0 :would you know you talk about the


2:00:25
Speaker 1 :seminal people who are French in
 artificial intelligence France welcomes him with open arms in so many ways Ijust don't feel the love from Russia I I
 do on the human beings like people in general like friends and and just coolinteresting people but from the
 scientific community no conferences no big conferences andit's uh yeah it's actually you know I


2:00:50
Speaker 0 :I'm trying to think yeah I cannot recall
 any any big AI conferences in Russia it

2:01:02
Speaker 1 :has an effect on for me
 I haven't sadly been back to Russia so I should but my problem is it's verydifficult so I am now I have to renounce
 the citizenship I was alright I mean I'm a citizen in the United States and itmakes it very difficult there's a mess
 now right so I want to be able to travel

2:01:20
Speaker 0 :

2:01:21
Speaker 1 :like you know legitimately yeah and it's
 it's not it's not an obvious process they don't make it super easy I meanthat's
 that like you know it should be super easy for me to travel there well you

2:01:34
Speaker 0 :know hopefully this unfortunate
 circumstances that we are in will actually promote the remotecollaborations yes and I think we weave
 jr' experiencing right now is that you still can do science you know beingcurrent in in your own homes yeah
 especially when it comes I mean you know I I certainly understand there is a verychallenging time for experimental
 scientists and and I have many collaborators who are you know who areaffected by that but for computational
 scientists they are really leading into

2:02:15
Speaker 1 :the remote communication nevertheless I
 had to force you to talk to you in person because there's something thatyou just can't do in terms of
 conversation like this I don't know why but in person it's very much needed so Ireally appreciate you doing it you have
 a collection of science bobbleheads yes

2:02:35
Speaker 0 :

2:02:36
Speaker 1 :which look amazing which which
 bobblehead is your favorite and which real-world version which scientist isyour favorite yeah so yeah by the way I


2:02:46
Speaker 0 :was trying to bring it in but they're
 cranking now in my in my office they sort of demonstrate the social distanceso they're nicely spaced away from each
 other but so you know it's interesting so I've been I've been collecting thosebubble has for the past maybe twelve or
 thirteen years and it you know interesting enough it started with thetwo bubble heads of Watson and Crick and
 interestingly enough my last bubble had in this collection for now and myfavorite one cuz I felt so good when I
 got it was the rosalind Franklin and so so you know when I go who's the fullgroup so I have what some Creek Newton
 Einstein Marie Curie Tesla of course CharlesDarwin Sir Charles Darwin and wasn't
 Franklin I am definitely missing quite a few of my favorite scientists and but soyou know if I were to add to this
 collection so I would add of course Kolmogorov injustice that's that's youknow I've been always fascinated by his
 well his dedication to science but also his dedication to educating young peoplethe next generation so it's it's it's
 very inspiring he's one of the right

2:04:37
Speaker 1 :okay yeah he's one of the Russia's great


2:04:40
Speaker 0 :yes only yes so he also you know the
 school the high school that I attended was named after him and he was great youknow so he founded this core school and
 he actually taught there is this is a Moscow yes so but then I mean you knowother people that I would definitely
 like to see in my collections was would be Alan Turing would be John von Neumann

2:05:18
Speaker 1 :yeah you're a little bit later in the
 computer scientists yes well I mean they

2:05:21
Speaker 0 :don't they don't make them you know III
 still I'm amazed they they haven't made Alan Turing yeah yet yes and and and Iwould also add the Linus Pauling line is
 falling so with Linus point so this is

2:05:40
Speaker 1 :

2:05:41
Speaker 0 :this is to me is one of the greatest
 chemists and the person who actually discoveredsecondary structure of proteins was very
 close to solving the DNA structure and you know people argue but some of themwere pretty sure that if not for this
 you know photograph 51 by rosalind Franklin thatyou know what Sun Cree got access to he
 would be he would be the one who so

2:06:27
Speaker 1 :sense is a funny race


2:06:30
Speaker 0 :

2:06:31
Speaker 1 :let me ask the biggest the most
 ridiculous question so you've kind of studied the human body and its defensesand these enemies that are about from a
 biological perspective and from a tax perspective a computer scientistperspective how is that made you see
 your own life sort of the meaning of it or just even seeing your what it meansto be human


2:07:03
Speaker 0 :well it certainly makes me realizing how
 fragile the human life is if you think about this little tiny thing can impactthe life of the whole human kind to such
 extent so you know it's it's something to appreciate and to you know toremember that that you know we are
 fragile we have to bond together as a societyand you know it also gives me sort of
 hope that what we do a scientist is useful I don't think there's a better

2:08:05
Speaker 1 :way to end it means you take it so much
 for talking today it was an honor thank
