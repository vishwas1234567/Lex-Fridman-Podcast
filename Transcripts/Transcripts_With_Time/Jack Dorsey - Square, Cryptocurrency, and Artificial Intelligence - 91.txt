Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Jack Dorsey co-founder and CEO of Twitter and founder and CEO of squaregiven the happenings at the time related
 to Twitter leadership and the very limited time we had we decided to focusthis conversation on square and some
 broader philosophical topics and to save an in-depth conversation on engineeringat AI and Twitter for second appearance
 in this podcast this conversation was recorded before the outbreak of thepandemic for everyone feeling the
 medical psychological and financial burden of this crisisI'm sending love your way stay strong
 we're in this together we'll beat this thing as an aside let memention the jack moved 1 billion dollars
 square equity which is 28% of his wealth

0:02:49
Speaker 0 :Joe Rogan Sam Harris rich roll others
 excellent conversations but I think there's several topics that you didn'ttalk about that I think of fascinating
 that I love to talk to you about sort of machine learning artificial intelligenceboth the the narrow kind and the general
 kind and engineering at scale so there's a lot of incredible engineering going onthe year part of crypto cryptocurrency a
 blockchain ubi all kinds of philosophical questions maybe we'll getto while life and death and meaning and
 beauty so you're involved in building some of the biggest network systems inthe world sort of trillions and
 interactions a day the cool thing about that is the infrastructure theengineering scale you started as a
 programmer with C by building yeah so

0:03:39
Speaker 1 :I'm a hacker I'm not really an engineer


0:03:40
Speaker 0 :not not a legit software engineer and
 I'm a tracker at heart but to achieve scale you have to do some unfortunatelylegit large-scale engineering so how do


0:03:51
Speaker 1 :you make that magic happen hire people
 that I can learn from number one I mean I'm a hacker in the sense that I youknow my approach has always been do
 whatever it takes to make it work so that I can see and feel the thing andthen learn what needs to come next and
 oftentimes what needs to come next is a matter of being able to bring it to morepeople which is scale and there's a lot
 of great people out there that either have experience or are extremely fastlearners
 that we've been lucky enough to find and with for four years but I think a lot ofit we benefit a ton from the open source
 community and just all the learnings there that are laid bare in the open allthe mistakes all the success all the
 problems it's a very slow-moving process usually open source but it's verydeliberate and you get to see because of
 the the pace you get to see what it takes to really build somethingmeaningful so I learned most most of
 everything I learned about hacking and programming and engineering has been dueto open source and and the the
 generosity that people have given to give up their time sacrificer timewithout any expectation in return other
 than being a part of something much larger than themselves yeah just great

0:05:28
Speaker 0 :open-source movement is amazing but if
 you just look at the scale like Square has to take care of is this afundamentally a software problem or
 hardware problem you mentioned hiring a bunch of people but said it's not maybefrom our perspective not often talked
 about how incredible that is to sort of have a system that doesn't go down oftenthat secure is able to take care of all
 these transactions like maybe I'm I'm also a hacker at heart and it'sincredible to me that that kind of scale
 could be achieved is there some insight some lessons some interesting tidbitsthat you can say about how to make that
 scale happen is it the hardware fundamentally challenge is it a softwarechallenge is it like is it a social
 challenge of building large teams of engineers that work together that kindof thing that quotes is there what's the


0:06:27
Speaker 1 :interesting challenges there by the way
 you're the best Russ hacker I've ever met I think thank you both if theenumeration you just went through I
 don't think there's one you have to kind of focus on all and the ability to focuson all that really comes down to how you
 these problems and whether you can break them down into parts that you can focuson because I think the biggest mistake
 is trying to solve or address too many at once or not going deep enough withthe questions or not being critical of
 the answers you find or not form not taking the time to form crediblehypotheses that you can actually test
 and you can see the result of so all of those fall in the face of ultimatelycritical thinking skills problem-solving
 skills and if there's one skill I want to improve every day it's that that'sthat's what contributes to learning and
 the only way we can evolve any of these things is learning what is currentlydoing and and how to take it to the next
 the next step and questioning

0:07:44
Speaker 0 :assumptions the first principle is kind
 of thinking it seems like the fundamentals this whole process yeah but

0:07:50
Speaker 1 :if you get to overextend it into well
 this is a hardware issue you miss all the software solutions and you know viceversa if you focus too much on the
 software there are hardware solutions that can 10x the thing so I I try toresist the categories of thinking and
 look for the underlying systems that make all these things work but thoseonly emerge when you have a skill around
 creative creative thinking problem-solving and being able to askcritical questions and having the
 patience to like go deep so one of the

0:08:36
Speaker 0 :amazing things if you look at the
 mission of square is to increase people's access to the economy maybemaybe you can correct me if I'm wrong
 that's from my perspective so from the perspective of merchants peer-to-peerpayments even crypto cryptocurrency
 digital cryptocurrency what do you see as the major ways our society canincrease but this
 patient in the economy so if we look at today in the next 10 years next 20 yearsyou going to Africa maybe in Africa and
 all kinds of other places outside in

0:09:07
Speaker 1 :North America if there was one word that
 I think represents what we're trying to do at square it's it is that word accessone of the things we found is that we
 weren't expecting this at all when we started we thought were just building aa piece of hardware to enable people to
 plug it into their phone and swipe credit card and then as we talked withpeople who actually tried to accept
 credit cards in the past we found a consistent theme which many of themweren't even enabled and enabled but
 allowed to process credit cards and we dug a little bit deeper again askingthat question and we found that a lot of
 them would go to banks or these merchants acquirers and waiting for themwas a credit check and looking at a FICO
 score and many of the businesses that we talked to and many small businesses theydon't have good credit or a credit
 history they're entrepreneurs were just getting startedtaking a lot of personal risk financial
 risk and it just felt ridiculous to us that for for for the for the job ofbeing able to accept money from people
 you had to get your credit checked and as we dug deeper we realized that thatwasn't the intention of the financial
 industry but it's the only tool they had available to them to understandauthenticity intent predictor of future
 behavior so that's the first thing we actually looked at and that's where theyou know we built the hardware but the
 software really came in terms of risk modeling and that's when we started downthe path that eventually leads to AI we
 started with a very strong data science discipline because we knew that ourbusiness was not necessarily
 about making hardware it was more about enabling more people to come into the

0:11:18
Speaker 0 :system so the fundamental challenge
 there is so to enable more people to come into the system you have to lowerthe barrier of checking that that person
 would be a legitimate vendor is that the

0:11:30
Speaker 1 :fundamental problem yeah and a different
 mindset I think a lot of the financial industry had a mindset of kind of[Music]
 distrust and just constantly looking for opportunities to prove why peopleshouldn't get into the system whereas we
 took on a mindset of trust and then verify verify verify verify verify so wemoved you know when we when we entered
 the space only about thirty to forty percent of the people who apply toaccept credit cards would actually get
 through the system we took that number than 99% and that'sbecause we reframe the problem we built
 credible models and we had this mindset of we're going to watch not at themerchant level but we're going to watch
 at the transaction level so come in perform some transactions and as long asyou're doing things that feel high
 integrity credible and don't look suspicious we'll continue to to serveyou if we see any interestingness in how
 you use our system that will be bubbled up to people to review to figure out ifthere's something nefarious going on and
 that's when we might ask you to leave so the change in the mindset led to thetechnology that we needed to enable more
 people to get there and to enable more people to access system

0:13:09
Speaker 0 :what uh what role does machine learning
 play into that in that context of you said first of all that's a beautifulshift anytime you shift your viewpoint
 into seeing that people are fundamentally good and then you justhave to
 verify and catch the ones who are not as opposed to assuming everybody's bad thisis a beautiful thing so what role does
 the to you throughout the history of the companyhas machine learning played in doing


0:13:40
Speaker 1 :that verification it was it was a media
 I mean we weren't calling it machine learning but it was data science andthen as the industry evolved machine
 learning became more of the nomenclature and and as that evolved it became moresophisticated with deep learning and as
 I continues continues to evolve it'll be nobody another thing but they're all inthe same vein but we built that
 discipline up within the first year of the company because we also had you knowwe have to we had to partner with a bank
 we had to partner with Visa MasterCard and we had to show that by bringing morepeople into the system that we could do
 so in a responsible way that would not compromise their systems and that they

0:14:24
Speaker 0 :would trust us how do you convince this
 upstart company with some cool machine learning tricks is able to deliver onthe sort of a trustworthy set of


0:14:34
Speaker 1 :merchants we we stage it out in tears we
 had a bucket of you know five hundred people using it and then we showedresults in a thousand and then ten
 thousand that fifty thousand and then the constraint was left was lifted soagain it's it's kind of you know getting
 something tangible out there I want to show what we can do rather than talkabout it and that put a lot of pressure
 on us to do the right things and it also created a culture of accountability of alittle bit more transparency and I think
 incentivized all of our early folks and the company in the right way so what

0:15:18
Speaker 0 :does the future look like in terms of
 increasing people's access or if you look at IO T Internet of Things there'smore and more intelligent devices you
 can see there's some people even talking about our personal data as a thing thatwe could monetize more explicitly versus
 implicitly sort of everything can become part of the economyyou see so what what is the future of
 square look like instead of giving people access in all kinds of ways tobeing part of the economy as merchants


0:15:48
Speaker 1 :and as consumers I believe that the
 currency we use is is a huge part of the answer and I believe that the Internetdeserves and requires a native currency
 and that's why I'm I'm such a huge believer in in Bitcoin because it justour our biggest problem is a company
 right now is we cannot act like an Internet company opened a new market wehave to have a partnership with local
 bank we have to pay attention to different regulatory onboardingenvironments and a digital currency like
 Bitcoin takes in a bunch of that away where we can potentially launch aproduct in every single market around
 the world because they're all using the samecurrency and we we have consistent
 understanding of regulation and onboarding and-and-and what that meansso I think you know the the internet
 continuing to be accessible to people is number one and then I think currency isis number two and it will just allow for
 a lot more innovation a lot more speed in terms of what we can build and otherscan build and it's just it's just really
 exciting so I mean I would I want to be able tosee that and feel that in my lifetime so


0:17:16
Speaker 0 :in this aspect in other aspects you have
 a deep interest in cryptocurrency and distributed ledger tech in general Italked to metallic butterman yesterday
 on this podcast he says hi by the way

0:17:29
Speaker 1 :hey he's a brilliant brilliant person


0:17:32
Speaker 0 :talking a lot about Bitcoin and
 aetherium of course so can you maybe linger on this point what what do youfind appealing about Bitcoin about
 digital currency where do you see it going in the next 10 20 years and whatare some of the challenges with respect
 to Square but also just bigger far for a globallyfarah world for the way we we think
 about money I I think the most beautiful

0:17:59
Speaker 1 :thing about it is there's no one person
 setting the direction and there's no one person on the other side that can stopit so we have something that is pretty
 organic in nature and very principled in its original design and I you know Ithink the Bitcoin white paper is one of
 the most seminal works of computer science in the last 20 30 years it'sit's poetry I mean it's a really cool


0:18:30
Speaker 0 :

0:18:31
Speaker 1 :technology I mean that's not often


0:18:32
Speaker 0 :talked about sort of there's so much
 sort of hype around digital currency about the financial impacts of it butthe actual technology is quite beautiful
 from a computer science perspective yeah

0:18:41
Speaker 1 :and the underlying principles behind it
 that went into it even to the point of releasing it under a pseudonym I thinkthat's a very very powerful statement
 the timing of when it was released is powerful it was it was a total activistmove I mean it's it's moving the world
 forward and in a way that I think is extremely noble and honorable andenables everyone to be part of the story
 which is also really cool so you ask the question around 10 years in 20 years Imean I think the amazing thing is no one
 knows and it can emerge and every person that comes into the ecosystem whetherthey be a developer or someone who uses
 it can change its direction in small and large ways and that's what I think itshould because that's what the the
 Internet has shown is possible now there's complications with that ofcourse and there's you know certainly
 companies that own large ports so the you know net and conducted more thanothers and there's not equal access to
 every single person in the world just yet but all those problems are visibleenough to speak about them and to me
 that gives confidence that they're solvable in a relatively short timeframeI think the world changes a lot
 as we get these satellites projecting the internet down down earth because itjust removes a bunch of the former
 constraints and and really levels the playing field but a global currencywhich a native currency for the Internet
 is a proxy for is a very powerful concept and I don't think any one personon this planet truly understands the
 ramifications of that I think there's a lot of positives to it there's somenegatives as well but I think it's


0:20:36
Speaker 0 :possible sorry to interrupt do you think
 it's possible that this kind of digital currency would redefine the nature ofmoney so become the main currency of the
 world as opposed to being tied to fiat currency of different nations and toreally push the decentralization of


0:20:53
Speaker 1 :control of money definitely but I think
 the the bigger ramification is how it affects how society works and I thinkthere were there there are many positive
 ramifications outside around money just outside of just money money moneyis a foundational layer that enables so
 much more I was meeting with an entrepreneur in Ethiopia and payments isprobably the number one problem to solve
 across a continent both in terms of moving money acrossborders between nations on the continent
 or the amount of corruption within the current system but the lack of easy waysto pay people makes starting anything
 really difficult I met an entrepreneur who started the the lyft / uber ofEthiopia and one of the biggest problems
 she has is that it's not easy for her writers to pay the company it's not easyfor her to pay the drivers and that
 definitely has stunted her growth and made everything more challenging so thefact that she's she even has to think
 about payments instead of thinking about the best writer experience and the bestdriver experience is is pretty telling
 so I think as we get a more durable resilient and globalstandard we see a lot more innovation
 everywhere and I think there's no better case study for this than the variouscountries with and within Africa and and
 their entrepreneurs who are trying to start things within health orsustainability or transportation or a
 lot of the companies that we've seen that we've seen here so the majority ofcompanies I met in November when I spent
 a month on the continent were payments oriented you mentioned there's a small

0:22:52
Speaker 0 :tangent you mentioned the anonymous
 launch of Bitcoin is a sort of profound philosophical statement sudama's what'sthat even means there's a pseudonym for


0:23:04
Speaker 1 :said there's an identity tied to it it's
 not just anonymous it's a Nakamoto so a Nakamoto might represent one person ormultiple people but let me ask are you


0:23:14
Speaker 0 :Satoshi Nakamoto just just checking


0:23:17
Speaker 1 :thank you I wear what I tell you yes
 sure um but maybe you slip a pseudonym is constructed identity anonymity isjust kind of as you know ran random like
 drop something off and leave there's no intention to build an identity around itand well the identity being built was a
 short time window it was meant to stick around I think and to be known and it'sbeing honored in you know how the
 community thinks about building out like the concept of Satoshi Toshi's forinstance is one such an example but I
 think it was smart not to do it anonymous not to do it as a realidentity but to do it as soon an MB
 because I think it builds tangibility and a little bit of empathy that thiswas a human or a set of humans behind it
 and there's there's this natural identity that I can imagine but there is

0:24:20
Speaker 0 :also sacrifice of an ego that's a pretty


0:24:23
Speaker 1 :powerful thing from beautiful would you


0:24:25
Speaker 0 :do sort of philosophically to ask you
 the question would you do all the same things you're doing now ifyour name wasn't attached to it sort of
 if if you had to sacrifice the ego put another way is your ego deeply tied inthe decisions you've been making I hope


0:24:44
Speaker 1 :not I mean I I believe I would certainly
 attempt to do the things without my name having to be attached with it but it'shard to do that in a corporation legally
 that's the issue if I were to do more open-source things then absolutely likeI don't don't need my particular
 identity my real identity associated with it but I think you know theappreciation that comes from doing
 something good and being able to see it and see people use it is is prettyoverwhelming and powerful more so than
 maybe seeing your name in the in the headlines let's talk about artificial

0:25:31
Speaker 0 :intelligence a little bit if we could 70
 years ago Alan Turing formulated the Turing test to me natural language isone of the most interesting spaces of
 problems that are tackled by artificial intelligence it's the canonical problemof what it means to be intelligent he
 formulated as the Turing test me ask sort of the broad question how hard doyou think is it to pass the Turing test
 in the space of language just from a

0:25:58
Speaker 1 :very practical standpoint I think where
 we are now and and for at least years out is one where the artificialintelligence machine learning the deep
 learning models can bubble up interestingness very very quicklyand pair that with human discretion
 around severity around depth around nuance and and meaning I think for methe chasm the cross for general
 intelligences to be able to explain why and the meaning behind something

0:26:43
Speaker 0 :behind a decision mm-hmm for being


0:26:45
Speaker 1 :behind the decision so we got a sub so


0:26:49
Speaker 0 :Delta so the explained ability part is
 kind of essential to be able to explain using natural language why the decisions

0:26:55
Speaker 1 :were made that kind of thing yeah I mean
 I think that's one of our biggest risk and artificial intelligence goingforward is we are building a lot of
 black boxes that can't necessarily explain why they made a decision or whatcriteria they used to make the decision
 and we're trusting them more and more from lending decisions to contentrecommendation to driving to health like
 you know a lot of us have watches that tell us to understand how was itdeciding that I mean that that one's
 pretty pretty simple but you can imagine how complex they get and being able to

0:27:29
Speaker 0 :explain the reasoning behind some of
 those recommendations seems to be an essential part although it's a very hard

0:27:35
Speaker 1 :problem because sometimes even we can't
 explain why we make this that's what I

0:27:39
Speaker 0 :was I think we're being us sometimes a
 little bit unfair for to artificial intelligence systems because we're notvery good at these some of these things


0:27:49
Speaker 1 :

0:27:49
Speaker 0 :do you think a project for the
 ridiculous romanticized question but on that lineof thought do you think we'll ever be
 able to build a system like in the movie her that you could fall in love with sohave that kind of deep connection with


0:28:06
Speaker 1 :hasn't that already happened hasn't
 someone in Japan fallen in love with this who's AI there's always going to be

0:28:13
Speaker 0 :somebody that does that kind of thing I
 mean at a much larger scale of actually building relationships of being deeperconnections it doesn't have to be love
 but it just deeper connections with artificial intelligence systemsyou mentioned explained it there's lots


0:28:27
Speaker 1 :of function of the artificial
 intelligence and more a function of the individual and how they find meaning andwhere they find meaning do you think we


0:28:35
Speaker 0 :humans can find meaning in technology in


0:28:38
Speaker 1 :this kind of way yeah 100 percent 1
 percent and I don't necessarily think it's a negative but I you know it's it'sconstantly going to evolve so I don't
 know but I meaning is is something that's entirely subjective andI I don't think it's going to be a
 function of finding the magic algorithm that enables everyone to love it butmaybe but that question really gets that


0:29:09
Speaker 0 :the difference between human and machine
 the you had a little bit of an exchange with Elon Musk basically I mean it's atrivial version of that but I think
 there's a more fundamental question of is it possible to tell the differencebetween a bot and a human and do you
 think it's if we look into the future 10 20 years out do you think it would bepossible or is it even necessary to tell
 the difference in the digital space between a human and a robot can we havefulfilling relationships with each or do
 we need to tell the difference between

0:29:45
Speaker 1 :them I think it's certainly useful and
 certain problem domains to be able to tell the difference I think in others itmight not be as useful I think it's


0:29:56
Speaker 0 :possible for us today tell that


0:29:59
Speaker 1 :difference as the reverse the meta of


0:30:00
Speaker 0 :the Turing test well what's interesting


0:30:03
Speaker 1 :is I think the technology to create is
 moving much faster than the technology to detect you think so so if you look at

0:30:13
Speaker 0 :like adversarial machine learning
 there's a lot of systems that try to fool machine learning systems and atleast for me the hope is that the
 technology to defend will always be right there at least your sense is thatI don't know if they'll be right there I


0:30:30
Speaker 1 :mean it's it's a race right so the
 detection technologies have to be 2 or 10 steps ahead of the creationtechnologies this is a problem that I
 think the financial industry will face more and more because a lot of our riskmodels for instance are built around
 identity payments ultimately comes down to identity and you can imagine a worldwhere all this conversation around deep
 fakes goes towards the direction of driver's license or passports or stateidentities and people construct
 identities in order to get through a system such as ours to startaccepting credit cards or into the cash
 shop and those technologies seem to be moving very very quickly our ability todetect them I think is probably lagging
 at this point but certainly with more focus we can get ahead of it but this isgoing to touch everything so I think
 it's it's it's like security and we're never going to be able to build aperfect detection system we're only
 going to be able to you know what we should be focused on this is the speedof evolving it and being able to take
 signals that show correctness or errors as quickly as possible and move and tobe able to build that into our newer
 models or the or the self learning

0:32:05
Speaker 0 :models you have other worries like some
 people like Elon and others have worries of existential threats of artificialintelligence of artificial general
 intelligence or if you think more narrowly of all threats and concernsabout more narrow artificial
 intelligence like what are your thoughts in this domain do you have concerns areyou more optimistic I think you've all


0:32:27
Speaker 1 :and his in this book 21 boilin lessons
 for the 21st century yeah his last chapters around meditation and you lookat the title of the chapter and you're
 like oh it's kind of old meditation but the was interesting about that chapteris he believes that you know kids being
 born today growing up today Google has a stronger sense of their preferences thanthey do which you can easily imagine I
 can easily imagine today that Google probably knows my preference is morethan my mother does maybe not me per se
 but for someone growing up only knowing you know not only knowing what Google iscapable of or Facebook or Twitter or
 square or any of these things the self-awareness is being offloaded toother systems and particularly these
 these algorithms and his concern is that we lose that self-awareness because theself-awareness is now outside of us and
 it's doing such a better job at helping us direct our decisions around should Istand should I walk today what doctor
 should I choose who should I date all these things were now seeing play outvery quickly so he sees meditation as a
 tool to build the self awareness and to bring the focus back on why do I makethese decisions why do I react in this
 way why did I have this thought where did that come from

0:34:08
Speaker 0 :that's the way to regain control or


0:34:10
Speaker 1 :awareness maybe not control but put
 awareness so that you can be aware that yes I am offloading this decision tothis algorithm that I don't fully
 understand and can't tell me why it's doing the things that's doing becauseit's so complex that's not to say that


0:34:27
Speaker 0 :the algorithm can't be a good thing and
 to me recommender systems the best of what they can do is to help guide you ona journey of learning new ideas of


0:34:38
Speaker 1 :learning period it can be a great thing
 but do you know you're doing that are you aware that you're inviting it to dothat to you I think that's that's a
 little risky identifies right is that's perfectly okay but are you aware thatyou have that invitation and it's it's
 being acted upon and so that that's your

0:34:58
Speaker 0 :that's a concern you're kind of
 highlighting that without a lack of awareness you can just be like floatingat sea so awareness is key in just the
 future these artificial intelligence

0:35:10
Speaker 1 :systems in the other movie wall-e well
 Richard I think is one of Pixar's best moviesbesides ratatouille right you had me


0:35:19
Speaker 0 :until the ratatouille okay that error is
 incredible all right we've come to the first point where we disagree

0:35:28
Speaker 1 :okay the entrepreneurial story in the
 form of a wrath

0:35:33
Speaker 0 :

0:35:34
Speaker 1 :mm-hmm I just remember just the


0:35:35
Speaker 0 :soundtrack was really good so excellent


0:35:38
Speaker 1 :

0:35:41
Speaker 0 :what are your thoughts sticking on
 artificial intelligence a little bit about the displacement of jobs that'sanother perspective that candidates like
 Andrew yang talked about in getting

0:35:50
Speaker 1 :

0:35:52
Speaker 0 :forever yang Yang so he unfortunately
 speaking of yang Yang has recently

0:35:57
Speaker 1 :dropped out I know it was very
 disappointing and depressing

0:36:00
Speaker 0 :yeah but the on the positive side he's I
 think launching a podcast so really cool yeah that's he just announced that I'msure he'll try to talk you into trying
 to come on to the podcast so about

0:36:12
Speaker 1 :

0:36:13
Speaker 0 :Reddit Tori yeah maybe he'll be more
 welcoming of the ratatouille argument what are your thoughts on his concernsof the displacement of jobs of
 automations of the of course there's positive impacts that could come fromautomation in the eye and but there
 could also be negative impacts and within that framework what are yourthoughts about universal basic income so
 these interesting new ideas of how we can empower people in the economy I I

0:36:39
Speaker 1 :think he was a hundred percent right on
 almost every dimension we see this in squares business I mean he identifiedtruck drivers I'm from Missouri and he
 certainly pointed to the concern and the issue that people from where I'm fromfeel every single day that is often
 invisible and not talked about enough you know the next big one is cashiersthis is where it pertains to squares
 business we are seeing more and more of the point-of-sale moved to theindividual customers hand in the form of
 their phone and apps and pre-order and order ahead we're seeing more kioskswe're seeing more things like Amazon go
 and the number of workers in as a cashier and Rito's immense and you knowthere's there's no real answers on how
 they transform their skills and and work andinto something else and I think that
 does lead to a lot of really negative ramifications and the important pointthat he brought up around universal
 basic income is given that this shift is going to come and given it's going totake time to set people up with new
 skills and new careers they need to have a floor to be able to survive and this$1,000 a month is such a floor
 it's not going to incentivize you to quit your job because it's not enoughbut it will enable you to not have to
 worry as much about just getting on day to day so that you can focus on what I'mwhat am I going to do now and what am I
 going to what skills do I need to acquire and I think I think that youknow a lot of people point to the fact
 that you know during the industrial age we we had the same concerns aroundautomation factory lines and everything
 worked out okay but the the biggest change is just thevelocity and the centralization of a lot
 of the things that make this work which is the data and the algorithms that workon this on this data I think the the
 second biggest scary thing is just how around AI is just who actually owns thedata and who can operate on it and are
 we able to share the insights from the data so that we can also buildalgorithms that help our needs or help
 our business or what not so that's where I think regulation could play a strongand positive part first looking at the
 primitives of AI and the tools we use to build these services that willultimately touch every single aspect of
 the human experience and then how data where data is owned and how its how itsshared so those those are the answers
 that as a society as a world we need to have better answers around which we'recurrently not they're just way too
 centralized into a few very very large companies but I think he was spot-onwith identifying the problem and
 proposing solutions that would actually work at least that we'd learn from thatyou could expand or evolve but I mean
 it's I think it's ubi is well well past its it's do I mean it was certainlytrumpeted by Martin Luther King and even
 even before him as well and like you

0:40:44
Speaker 0 :said like you know the exact thousand
 dollar mark might be might not be the correct one but you should take thestuffs to try to to implement these
 solutions and see see what works so I

0:40:56
Speaker 1 :

0:40:57
Speaker 0 :think you and I eat some more diets and
 at least I was the first time I've heard

0:41:02
Speaker 1 :

0:41:03
Speaker 0 :this yeah so I was doing it first time


0:41:05
Speaker 1 :anyone has said that to me yeah but it's


0:41:08
Speaker 0 :becoming more and more cool and but I
 was doing it before was cool so the intermittent fasting and fastingin general I really enjoyed I love food
 but I enjoy the the I also love suffering because I'm Russian so fastingkind of makes you appreciate makes you


0:41:27
Speaker 1 :

0:41:28
Speaker 0 :appreciate what it is to be human
 somehow so but I have a outside the philosophical stuff I have a morespecific question it also helps me as a
 programmer and a deep thinker like stifling that from a scientificperspective to sit there for many hours
 and focus deeply maybe you were a hacker before you were CEO what have youlearned about diet lifestyle mindset
 that helps you maximize mental performance to be able to focus for thisthing deeply in this world of
 distractions I think I just took it for

0:42:04
Speaker 1 :granted for too long which aspect just a
 social structure of we eat three and there's snacks in between and I justnever really asked the question why oh


0:42:19
Speaker 0 :by the way in case people don't know I
 think a lot of people know who you you at least you famously eat once a dayyeah you still eat once a day yep


0:42:27
Speaker 1 :sooner by the way what made you decide


0:42:30
Speaker 0 :to eat once a day like cuz to me that
 was a huge revolution that you don't have to eat breakfast that was like Ifelt like I was a rebel like I yeah like
 abandoned my parents or something and it doesn't an artist when you when you

0:42:41
Speaker 1 :first like the first week you start
 doing it feels you kind of like have a superpower yeah then you realize it'snot really a superpower but it I think
 you realize at least I realize like it just how much is how much our minddictates what we're possible of and and
 sometimes we have structures around us the incentivize like you know there'sthree may thing which was purely social
 structure versus necessity for our health and for our bodies and I I did itjust I started doing it because I played
 a lot with my diet when I was a kid and I was vegan for two years and just wentall over the place just because I you
 know a health is the most precious thing we have and none of us really understandit so being able asked the question
 through experiments that I can perform on myself and learn about I iscompelling to me and I heard this one
 guy on the podcast wim HOF who's famous for doing ice baths and holding hisbreath and all these things he said he
 only eats one meal a day I'm like wow that sounds super challenging andcomfortable I'm gonna do it so I I just
 I learned the most when I make myself I want to say suffer but when I makemyself feel uncomfortable because
 everything comes to bear in those moments and and you really learn whatyour what you're about or what you're
 not so I been doing that my whole life like when I was a kid I could not likeI could not speak like I had to go to a
 speech therapist and it made me extremely shy and then one day Irealized I can't keep doing this and I
 signed up for the for the speech Club and you know it was a the mostuncomfortable thing I could imagine
 doing getting a topic on a note card having five minutes to write a speechabout whatever that topic is not being
 able to use the note card while speaking and speaking for five minutes about thattopic so but it just it puts so much it
 gave me so much perspective around the power of communication around my owndeficiencies and around if I set my mind
 to do something I'll do it so it gave me a lot more confidence so I see fastingin the same light this is something that
 was interesting challenging uncomfortable and has given me so muchlearning and benefit as a result and it
 will lead to other things that I experiment with and play with but umyeah it does feel a little bit like a
 superpower sometimes the most boring superpower one can imagine no it's quite

0:45:43
Speaker 0 :incredible the clarity of mind is it's
 pretty interesting

0:45:48
Speaker 1 :speaking of suffering you kind of talk


0:45:49
Speaker 0 :about facing difficult ideas you
 meditate you think about the broad context of life of our society let meask sort of apologize again for the
 romanticized question but do you ponder your own mortality do you think aboutdeath about the finiteness of human
 existence when you meditate when you think about it and if you do what how doyou make sense of it that this thing


0:46:21
Speaker 1 :ends well I don't try to make sense of
 it I do think about it every day I mean it's it's a daily multiple times a dayany afraid of death no I'm not afraid of
 it I I think it it's a transformation Idon't know to what but it's also a tool
 to feel the importance of every moment so Ijust use as a reminder like I have an
 hour is this really what I'm going to spendthe hour doing like I only have so many
 more sunsets and sunrises to watch like I'm not going to get up for it I'm notgoing to make sure that I that I that I
 try to see it so it's it just puts a lot into perspective and it helps meprioritize I think it's I don't I don't
 see it as something that's like that I dread or is dreadful it it's a it's atool that is available to every single
 person to use every day because it shows how precious life is and there'sreminders every single day whether it be
 your own health or a friend or a co-worker or something you see in thenews so it's to me it's just a question
 of what we do with that daily reminder and for me it's um am I really focusedon what matters and sometimes that might
 be work sometimes that might be friendships or family or relationshipsor whatnot but that that's it's the
 ultimate clarifier in that sense so on

0:47:52
Speaker 0 :the question of what matters another
 ridiculously big question of once you try to make sense of it what do youthink is the meaning of it all the
 meaning of life what gives you purpose happiness meaning

0:48:06
Speaker 1 :a lot does I mean I mean just being able
 to be aware of the fact that I'm alive is pretty pretty meaningful theconnections I feel with individuals
 whether they people I just meet or long lasting friendships or my family ismeaningful seeing people use something
 that I helped build it is really meaningful and powerful to me but butthat sense of I mean I think ultimately
 comes down in a sense of connection and just feeling like I am bigger I am partof something that's bigger than myself
 and like I can feel it directly in small ways or large wayshowever manifest this is probably uh
 it's probably a last question do you

0:48:59
Speaker 0 :think we're living in a simulation I


0:49:03
Speaker 1 :don't know it's a pretty fun one if we
 are but also crazy and random and brought with tons of problems but yeahwould you have it any other way
 yeah I mean I just think it's taken us way too long to as a planet to realizewe're all in this together and we all
 are connected in in in very significant ways I think we we hide our connectivityvery well through ego through you know
 whatever or whatever it is of the day but that is the one thing I would wantto work towards changing and that's how
 I would have it another way because if if we can't do that then how we're goingto connect to all the other simulations
 because that's the next step is like what's happening in the other simulation

0:49:59
Speaker 0 :escaping this one and yeah spanning
 across the multiple simulations and sharing it and on the fun I don't thinkthere's a better way to end it Jack
 thank you so much for all the work you do there's probably other ways that

0:50:12
Speaker 1 :we've ended this and other simulations
 that may have been better well that's a

0:50:17
Speaker 0 :wait and see thanks so much for talking
