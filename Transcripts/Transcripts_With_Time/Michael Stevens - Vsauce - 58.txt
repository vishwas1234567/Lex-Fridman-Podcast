Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 Michael Stevens the creator of Vsauce one of the most popular educationalYouTube channels in the world with over
 15 million subscribers and over 1.7 billion views his videos often ask andanswer questions that are both profound
 and entertaining spanning topics from physics to psychologypopular questions include what if
 everyone jumped at once or what if the Sun disappeared or why are things creepyor what if the earth stopped spinning as
 part of his channel he created three seasons of minefield a series thatexplored human behavior his curiosity
 and passion are contagious and inspiring to millions of people and so as aneducator has impacted contribution to
 the world is truly immeasurable this is the artificial intelligence podcast ifyou enjoy it subscribe I need to give
 five stars on a podcast support on patreon or simply connect with me onTwitter at lex Friedman's both fri DM
 aen i recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction i'll do one ortwo minutes after introducing the
 episode and never any ads in the middle that break the flow of the conversationI hope that works for you and doesn't


0:01:17
Speaker 1 :hurt the listening experience this show


0:01:18
Speaker 0 :is presented by cash app the number one
 finance app in the App Store I personally use cash app to send money tofriends but you can also use it to buy
 sell and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds cash app also has a new investingfeature you can buy fractions of a stock
 say $1 worth no matter what the stock price is brokerage services are providedby cash up investing a subsidiary of

 and cash app will also donate $10 to the firstwhich again is an organization that I've
 personally seen inspired girls and boys to dream of engineering a better worldand now here's my conversation with


0:02:24
Speaker 1 :Michael Stevens one of your deeper


0:02:26
Speaker 0 :interests is psychology understanding
 human behavior you've pointed out how messy studying human behavior is andit's far from the scientific rigor of
 something like physics for example how do you think who can take psychologyfrom where it's been in the 20th century
 to something more like what the physicists theoretical physicists aredoing something precise something


0:02:52
Speaker 1 :rigorous well we we could do it by
 finding the physical foundations of psychology right if if all of ouremotions and moods and feelings and
 behaviors are the result of mechanical behaviors of atoms and molecules in ourbrains then can we find correlations
 perhaps like chaos makes that really difficult and the uncertainty principleand all these things like we can't know
 the position and velocity of every single you know quantum state in a brainprobably but I think that if we you know
 can get to that point with psychology then we can start to think aboutconsciousness in a physical and and
 mathematical way when we ask questions like well what is self reference how canyou think about yourself thinking what
 are some mathematical structures that could bring that about there's ideas of

0:03:51
Speaker 0 :in terms of consciousness and breaking
 it down into a physics there's ideas of pants like ism where people believe thatwhatever consciousness is is a
 fundamental part of reality it's almost like a physics law do you think what'syour views on consciousness do you think
 it has this this deep part of reality or is it something that's deeply human and

0:04:19
Speaker 1 :constructed by us humans start nice and
 light yeah an easy easy I think I asked

0:04:24
Speaker 0 :you today has
 actually proven answer so yeah

0:04:28
Speaker 1 :hypothesis so yeah I mean I should
 clarify this is all speculation yeah and I'm not an expert in any of these talkto topics and I'm not God but I think
 that consciousness is probably um something that can be fully explainedwithin the laws of physics I think that
 our you know bodies and brains and and the universe and and at the quantumlevel is so rich and complex
 I'd be surprised if we couldn't find a room for consciousness there and whyshould we be conscious why are we aware
 of ourselves that is a very strange and interesting and important question and Ithink for the next few thousand years
 we're going to have to believe in answers purely on faith but my guess isthat we will find that you know within
 the configuration space of possible arrangements of the universe there aresome that contain memories of others
 literally uh Julian Barbour calls them time capsule states where you're likeyeah not only do I have a scratch on my
 arm but also this state of the universe also contains a memory in my head ofbeing scratched by my cat three days ago
 and for some reason those kinds of states of the universe are moreplentiful or more likely when you say


0:05:55
Speaker 0 :those states the ones would that contain
 memories of its past or ones that contain memories of its past and havedegrees of consciousness just the first


0:06:05
Speaker 1 :part because the I think the
 consciousness then emerges from the fact that a state of the universe thatcontains fragments or memories of other
 states is one where you're going to feel like there's time you're going to feellike yeah things in the happened in the
 past and I don't know what'll happen in the future because these states don'tcontain information about the future for
 some reason those kind of states are either more common more plentiful or youcould use the anthropic principle
 just say well they're extremely rare but until you are in one or if you are inone then you can ask questions like you
 you're asking me on this podcast slide questions but yeah it's like what whyare we conscious well because if we
 weren't we wouldn't be asking why we

0:06:55
Speaker 0 :were you've kind of implied that you
 have a sense again hypothesis theorizing that the universe is deterministicwhat's your thoughts about freewill do
 you think of the universe is deterministic in a sense that it'sunrolling in particular like there's a
 it's operating under a specific set of physical laws and when you have to setthe initial conditions it will unroll in
 the exact same way in our particular line of the universe every time that is

0:07:27
Speaker 1 :a very useful way to think about the
 universe it's done as well it's brought us to the moon it's brought us to wherewe are today right I would not say that
 I believe in determinism in that kind of an absolute form or actually I justdon't care maybe it's true but I'm not
 gonna live my life like it is what in

0:07:49
Speaker 0 :your son's because you've studied kind
 of how we humans think of the world what's in your view is the differencebetween our perception like how we think
 the world is in reality do you think there's a huge gap there like we deludeourselves as the whole thing is an
 illusion just everything about human psychology the way we see things and howthings actually are all the things
 you've studied what's your sense how big

0:08:16
Speaker 1 :is the gap between reality well sin
 purely speculative I think that we will never know the answer we cannot know theanswer there is no experiment to find an
 answer to that question everything we experience is an event in our brain whenI look at a cat I'm not even I can't
 prove that there's a cat there all I am experiencing is the perception of a catinside my own brain I am only a witness
 to the events of my mind I think it is very useful to infer that if I witnessthe event of cat
 in my head it's because I'm looking at a cat that is literally there and has itsown feelings and motivations and should
 be pet and given food and water and love I think that's the way you should liveyour life but whether or not we live in
 a simulation I'm a brain-in-a-vat I don't know and do care mmm I don'treally well I care because it's a
 fascinating question and it's a fantastic way to get people excitedabout all kinds of topics physics
 psychology consciousness philosophy but at the end of the day what would the

0:09:30
Speaker 0 :difference be if you the cat needs to be
 fed at the end of the day otherwise

0:09:34
Speaker 1 :it'll be a dead cat right but if it's
 not even a real cat then it's just like a video game cat and right so what's thedifference between killing a a digital
 cat in a video game because of neglect versus a real cat it seems verydifferent to us psychologically like I
 don't really feel bad about oh my gosh I forgot to feed my Tamagotchi right but Iwould feel terrible if I forgot to feed
 my actual cats so can you just touch on

0:09:59
Speaker 0 :the topic of simulation do you find this
 thought experiment that we're living in a simulation useful inspiring aconstructive in any kind of way do you
 think it's ridiculous do you think it could be true or is it just a useful

0:10:16
Speaker 1 :thought experiment I think it is
 extremely useful as a thought experiment because it makes sense to everyoneespecially as we see virtual reality and
 computer games getting more and more complex you're not talking to anaudience in like Newton's time where
 you're like imagine a clock that it has mechanics in it that are so complex thatit can create love and everyone's like
 no but today you really start to feel you know man at what point is thislittle robot friend of mine gonna be
 like someone I don't want to cancel plans with yeah you know and so it's agreat the thought experiment of do we
 live in a simulation am i a brain and a bat that has just been given electricalimpulses from some nefarious
 other beans so that I believe that I live on earth and that I have a body andall of this and the fact that you can't
 prove it either way is a fantastic way to introduce people to some of the

0:11:20
Speaker 0 :deepest questions so you mentioned a
 little buddy that you would want to cancel an appointment with so that's alot of our conversations that's where my
 research is artificial intelligence and I apologize but you're such a fun personto ask these big questions with well I


0:11:36
Speaker 1 :hope I could give some answers that are
 interesting well because because of

0:11:40
Speaker 0 :you've sharpened your brain's ability to
 explore some of the most some of the questions then many signs is actuallyafraid of even touching which is
 fascinating and I think you're in that sense ultimately a great scientistthrough this process of sharpening your


0:11:58
Speaker 1 :brain well I don't know if I am a
 scientist I think you know science is a way of knowing and there are a lot ofquestions I investigate that are not
 scientific questions on like minefield we have definitely done scientificexperiments and studies that had
 hypotheses and all that but you know not to be too like Precious about what doesthe word science mean but I think I
 would just describe myself as curious and I hope that that curiosity is

0:12:29
Speaker 0 :contagious so to you the scientific
 method is deeply connected to science because your curiosity took you toasking questions to me asking a good
 question even if you feel society feels that it'snot a question within the reach of
 science currently to me that asking the question is the biggest step of thescientific process the scientific method
 is the second part and that may be what traditionally is called science but tome asking the questions being brave
 enough to ask the questions being curious and not constrained by whatyou're supposed to think is is just true
 or what it means to be a scientist to me

0:13:11
Speaker 1 :it's certainly a huge part of what it
 means to be a human if I were to say you know what I don't believe in forces Ithink that when I push on
 a massive object a ghost leaves my body and enters the object I'm pushing andthese ghosts happen to just get really
 lazy when they're around massive things and that's why F equals MA oh and by theway the laziness of the ghost is in
 proportion to the mass of the object so boom prove me wrong every experimentwell you can never find the ghost and so
 none of that theory is scientific but once I start saying can I see the ghostWhy should there be a ghost and if there
 aren't ghosts what might I expect and I start to do different tests to see isthis falsifiable are there things that
 should happen if there are ghosts or things that shouldn't happen and do theyyou know what do I observe now I'm
 thinking scientifically I don't think of science as wow a picture of a black holethat's just a photograph that's an image
 that's data that's a sensory and reception experience science is how wegot that and how we understand it and
 how we believe in it and how we reduce our uncertainty around what it means but

0:14:23
Speaker 0 :I would say I'm deeply within the
 scientific community and and sometimes disheartened by the elitism of thethinking sort of not allowing yourself
 to think outside the box so allowing the possibility of going against theconventions asides I think is is a
 beautiful part some of the greatest

0:14:45
Speaker 1 :scientists in history I don't know I
 I'm impressed by scientists every day and revolutions in our knowledge of theworld occur
 only under very special circumstances it is very scary to challenge conventionalthinking and and and risky because let's
 go back to elitism and ego right if you just say you know what I believe in thespirits of my body and all forces are
 actually created by invisible creatures that that that transfer themselvesbetween objects
 if you ridicule every other theory and say that you're what you're you'recorrect then ego gets involved and you
 just don't go anywhere but the fundamentally the question of well whatis a force isn't incredibly important we
 need to have that conversation but it needs to be done in this very politicalway of like let's be respectful of
 everyone and let's realize that we're all learning together and not shuttingout other people and so when you look at
 a lot of revolutionary ideas they were not accepted right away and you knowGalileo had a couple of problems with
 the authorities and later thinkers Descartes was like all right look I kindof agree with Galileo but I'm gonna have
 to not say that I'll have to create and invent and write different things thatkeep me from being in trouble but we
 still slowly made progress revolutions

0:16:17
Speaker 0 :are difficult in all forms and certainly
 in science before we get to AI on topic of revolutionary ideas let me ask on areddit AMA you said that is the earth
 flat is one of the favorite questions you've ever answer yeah speaking ofrevolutionary ideas so your video on
 that people should definitely watch is really fascinating can you elaborate whyyou enjoyed answering this question so


0:16:42
Speaker 1 :much yeah well it's a long story I
 remember a long time ago I was living in New York at the time so had to have beenlike 2009 or something I visited the
 Flat Earth forums and this was before the Flat Earth theories became as sortof mainstream as they are I'm sorry to


0:17:02
Speaker 0 :ask the dumb question forums online


0:17:06
Speaker 1 :forums yeah okay the Flat Earth Society
 I don't know if it's con org but went there and I was reading you knowtheir ideas and how they responded to
 typical criticisms of well the earth isn't flat because what about this and Icould not tell and I mentioned this in
 my video I couldn't tell how many of these community members actuallybelieved the earth was flat or were just
 trolling and I realized that the fascinating thing is how do we knowanything and what makes for a good
 belief versus a maybe not so tenable or good belief and so that's really what myvideo about earth being flat is about
 it's about look there are a lot of reasons the earth is probably not flatbut a Flat Earth believer can respond to
 every single one of them but it's all in an ad hoc way and all of these all theirrebuttals aren't necessarily gonna form
 a cohesive noncontradictory whole and I believe that's the episode where I talkabout Occam's razor and Newton's flaming
 laser sword and then I say well you know what wait a second we know that spacecontracts as you move and so to a
 particle moving near the speed of light towards Earth earth would be flattenedin the direction of that particles
 travel so to them earth is flat like we need to be you know really generous toeven wild ideas because they're all
 thinking they're all the communication of ideas and what else can it mean to be

0:18:47
Speaker 0 :a human yeah and I think I'm a huge fan
 of the Flat Earth theory quote-unquote in the sense that to me feels harmlessto explore some of the questions of what
 it means to believe something what it means to explore the edge of science andso on it's because it's a harm it's to
 me nobody gets hurt whether the earth is flat or round not literally but I meanintellectually when we're just having a
 conversation that said again to elitism I find that scientists roll their eyesway too fast on the Flat Earth the kind
 of dismissal that I see to this you of an ocean they haven't like sat downand say what are the arguments they're
 being proposed and this is why these arguments incorrect so this is you knowthat should be something that scientists
 should always do even to the most sort of ideas that seem ridiculous so I likethis is almost it's almost my test when
 I ask people what they think about Flat Earth theory to see how quickly they

0:19:49
Speaker 1 :roll their eyes
 well yeah I mean let me go on record yeah and say that the earth is not flatit is a three-dimensional spheroid
 however I don't know that and it has not been proven signs doesn't prove anythingit just reduces uncertainty could the
 earth actually be flat extremely unlikely yes extremely unlikely and soit is a ridiculous notion if we care
 about how probable and certain our ideas might be but I think it's incrediblyimportant to talk about science in that
 way and to not resort to well it's true it's true in the same way that amathematical theorem is true and I think
 we're kind of like being pretty pedantic about defining this stuff but like sureI could take a rocket ship out and I
 could sorbets earth and look at it and it would look like a ball right but Istill can't prove that I'm not living in
 a simulation that i'm not a brain-in-a-vat that this isn't all anelaborate ruse created by some
 technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization right sothere's always some doubt and that's
 fine that's exciting and I think that

0:21:12
Speaker 0 :kind of doubt practically speaking is
 useful when you start talking about quantum mechanics or string theory sortof it helps to me that kind of little
 adds a little spice into the thinking process of scientists so I mean just Ijust as a thought experiment your video
 kind of okay say the earth is flat what would the forces when you walkabout this flat or earth feel like
 - the human that's a really nice thought experiment to think about right cuz

0:21:40
Speaker 1 :what's really nice about it is that it's
 it's a funny thought experiment but you actually wind up accidentally learning awhole lot about gravity and about
 relativity and geometry and I think that's really the goal of what I'm doingI'm not trying to like convince people
 that the earth is round I feel like you either believe that it is or you don'tand like that's you know how can I
 change that yeah what I can do is change how you think and how you are introducedto important concepts like well how does
 gravity operate oh it's all about the center of mass of an object so right ona sphere we're all pulled towards the
 middle essentially the centroid geometrically but on a disk ooh you'regonna be pulled at a weird angle if
 you're out near the edge and that stuff's fascinating yeah and to me

0:22:28
Speaker 0 :that's that that was that that


0:22:33
Speaker 1 :particular video opened my eyes even


0:22:34
Speaker 0 :more to what gravity is it's just a
 really nice visualization to love because you always imagine gravity wasspheres with masses that are spheres
 yeah and imagining gravity on masses that are not spherical some some othershape but in here a plate a flat object
 is really interesting it makes you really kind of visualizing it they're

0:22:57
Speaker 1 :much a way the force yeah even if a disc
 the size of Earth would be impossible I think anything larger than like themoon basically needs to be a sphere
 because gravity will round it out so you can't have a teacup the size of Jupiterright there's a great book about a
 teacup in the universe that highly recommend I don't remember theauthor I forget her name but it's a
 wonderful book so look it up I think it's called teacup in theuniverse still linked on this point


0:23:30
Speaker 0 :briefly your videos are generally super
 people love them right if you look at the sort of number of likes versusdislikes it's this measure of YouTube
 right is incredible and as do I but this particular Flat Earth video has moredislikes that than usual what what are
 you on that topic in general what's your sense how big is the community not justwho believes in Flat Earth but sort of
 the anti scientific community that naturally distrust scientists in a waythat's that's not an open-minded way
 like really just distrust scientists like they're bought by some placethey're kind of mechanism of the some
 kind of bigger system that's trying to manipulate him ins what's your sense ofthe size of that community you're one of
 the sort of great educators in the world that educates people on the excitingpower of science so you're kind of up
 against this community what's your sense

0:24:38
Speaker 1 :of it i I really have no idea I haven't
 looked at the likes and dislikes on the Flat Earth video and so I would wonderif it has a greater percentage of
 dislikes than usual is that because of people disliking it because they youknow think that it's a video about earth
 being flat and they find that ridiculous and they just like it without evenreally watching much do they wish that I
 was more like dismissive of this latter theories yeah that's awesome I knowthere are a lot of response videos that
 kind of go through the episode and are pro Flat Earth mm-hmm but I don't knowif there's a larger community of
 unorthodox thinkers today than there have been in the past okay and I justwant to not lose them I want them to
 keep listening and thinking and by calling them all you knowidiots
 or something like that is no good because how idiotic are they really Imean the earth isn't a sphere at all
 like we know that it's an oblate spheroid and that in and of itself isreally interesting and I investigated
 that in which way is down where I'm like really down does not point towards thecenter of the earth
 it's it points in a different direction depending on what's underneath you andwhat's above you and what's around you
 the whole universe is is tugging on me

0:26:05
Speaker 0 :and then you also show that gravity is
 non-uniform work across the globe like if you just gues thought experiment ifyou build a bridge all the way and all
 the way across the earth and then just knock out its pillars what would happenyeah and you described how it would be
 like a very chaotic unstable thing that's happening because gravity isnon-uniform all throughout the earth


0:26:31
Speaker 1 :yeah in small spaces like the ones we
 work in we can essentially assume that gravity is uniform but it's not it isweaker the further you are from the
 earth and it also is going to be it's it's radially pointed towards the middleof the earth so a really large object
 will feel tidal forces because of that non-uniform this and we can takeadvantage of that with satellites right
 gravitational induced torque it's a great way to align your satellitewithout having to use fuel or any kind
 of you know engine so let's jump back to

0:27:05
Speaker 0 :it artificial intelligence what's your
 thought of the state of where we are at currently with artificial intelligenceand what do you think it takes to build
 human level or superhuman level

0:27:17
Speaker 1 :intelligence I don't know what
 intelligence means that's my biggest question at the moment and it's I thinkit's cuz my instinct is always to go
 well what are the foundations here of our discussion what does it mean to beintelligent how do we measure the
 intelligence of an artificial machine or a program or something can we say that

0:27:37
Speaker 0 :humans are intelligent because there's
 also a fascinating field of how do you measure human intelligence of course butif we just take that for granted saying
 that the whatever this fuzzy intelligence thing we're talking abouthumans kind of have it what would be a
 good test for you for touring develop a test that's natural languageconversation would that impress you
 a chatbot that you'd want to hang out and have a beer with of you know for abunch of hours or have dinner plans with
 with is that a good test natural energy conversation is there something elsethat would impress you or is that also


0:28:13
Speaker 1 :to differ yeah I'm pretty much impressed
 by everything well I think if Roomba if there was a chat bot that was likeincredibly and I don't know really had a
 personality and I if I didn't be the the Turing test right like if I'm unable totell that it's not another person but
 then I was shown a bunch of wires and mechanical components and then it waslike that's actually what's you're
 talking to I don't know if I would feel that guilty destroying it I would feelguilty because clearly it's well-made
 and it's a really cool thing it's like destroying a really cool caror something but I would not feel like I
 was a murderer so yeah at what point would I start to feel that way and andthis is such a subjective psychological
 question if you give it movement or if you have it mmm act as though or perhapsreally feel pain as I destroy it and
 scream and resist then I'd feel that

0:29:16
Speaker 0 :yeah that's beautifully put and let's
 just say act like it's in pain so if you just have a robot that it's not screamsjust like moans in pain if you kick it
 yeah that immediately just puts it in a class that we humans it becomes it weanthropomorphize it almost immediately
 it becomes human yeah that psychology question as opposed to sort of a physics

0:29:40
Speaker 1 :question right I think that's a really
 good instinct to have you know if the robot screams screams and and and moanseven if you don't believe that it has
 the mental experience the qualia of pain and suffering I think it's still a goodinstinct to say you know what I'd rather
 not hurt it the problem is that instant

0:30:00
Speaker 0 :can get us in trouble because then
 robots can manipulate that and you know there's different kinds of robots asrobots like the Facebook and the YouTube
 algorithm that recommends the video and they can manipulate in the same kind ofway well let me ask you just to stick on
 artificial intelligence for a second do you have worries about existentialthreats from AI or extension tests from
 other technologies like nuclear weapons that could potentially destroy life onEarth or damage it to a very significant


0:30:30
Speaker 1 :degree yeah of course I do
 especially the weapons that we create there's all kinds of famous ways tothink about this and one is that Wow
 what if we don't see advanced alien civilizations because of the danger ofTechnology what if we reach a point and
 I think there's a channel-body to cheese I wish I remember the name of thechannel but he delves into this this
 kind of limit of maybe once you discover radioactivity and its power you'vereached this important hurdle and the
 reason that the skies are so empty is that no one's ever like managed tosurvive as a civilization once they have
 that destructive power and when it comes to AI I'm not really very worriedbecause I think that there are plenty of
 other people that are already worried enough and oftentimes these worries arejust they just get in the way of
 progress and they're there questions that we should address later and youknow I think I talked about this in my
 interview with the self-driving autonomous vehicle guy as I think it wasa bonus scene from the trolley problem
 episode and I'm like wow what should a car do if like this really weirdcontrived scenario happens where it has
 to like swerve and like save the driver but kill a kid and he's like well youknow what would a human do and if we
 resist technological progress because we're worried about all of these littleissues then it gets in the way and we
 shouldn't avoid those problems but we shouldn't allow them to be stumblingblocks
 - advancement so the you know folks like

0:32:19
Speaker 0 :Sam Harris or Elon Musk are saying that
 we're not worried enough so worried should not paralyze technologicalprogress but we're sort of marching
 technologies marching forward without the key scientists the developing andtechnology worrying about the overnight
 having some effects that would be very detrimental to society so the push backon your thought of the idea that there's
 enough people worrying about it Elon Musk says there's not enough peopleworrying about it I think that's the
 kind of balances you know it's like folks to who really focused on nucleardeterrence are saying there's not enough
 people worried about nuclear deterrence right so it's an interesting question ofwhat is a good threshold of people to
 worry about these and if it's too many people that are worried you're rightit'll be like the the press would over
 report on it and there'll be technological halt technology progressif not enough then we can march straight
 ahead into that abyss that human beings might be destined for with the progress

0:33:31
Speaker 1 :of technology yeah I don't know what the
 right balance is of how many people should be worried and how worried shouldthey be but we're always worried about
 new technology you know we know that Plato was worried about the written wordhe's like we shouldn't teach people to
 write because then they won't use their minds to remember things there therehave been concerns over technology and
 its advancement since the beginning of recorded history and so you know I thinkhowever these conversations are really
 important to have because again we learn a lot about ourselves if we're reallyscared of some kind of AI like coming
 into being that is conscious or whatever and and can self-replicatewe already do that every day it's called
 humans being born they're not artificial they're they're they're humans butthey're intelligent and I don't want to
 live in a world where we're worried about babies being born because what ifthey become evil right what if they
 become mean people what if they what if they're thieves maybe we should justlike what not have
 babies born like maybe we shouldn't create AI it's like you know we willwant to have safeguards in place yeah in
 the same way that we know look a kid could be born that becomes some kind ofevil person but we have loss right and


0:34:48
Speaker 0 :it's possible that with advantage in
 etics and general be able to you know it's a scary thought to say that youknow the this my child
 if born would be would have an 83% chance of being a psychopath right likebeing able to if it's something genetic
 if there's some sort of and what to use that information what to do with thatinformation is a difficult ethical yeah


0:35:18
Speaker 1 :I'd like to find an answer that isn't
 well let's not have them live you know I'd like to find an answer that is wellall human life is worthy and if you have
 an 83% chance of becoming a psychopath well you still deserve dignity yeah andyou still deserve to be treated well and
 a you still have rights

0:35:43
Speaker 0 :at least at this part of the world at
 least in America there's a respect for individual life in that way that's wellto me but again I'm in this bubble is a
 beautiful thing but there's other cultures or individual human life is notthat important that we're a society so I
 was born in Soviet Union where the strength of nation and society togetheris more important than the any one
 particular individual there's an interesting also notion the stories wetell ourselves I like the one where
 individuals matter but it's unclear that that was what the future holds well yeah

0:36:18
Speaker 1 :and I mean let me even throw this out
 like what is artificial intelligence how can it be artificial I really think thatwe get pretty obsessed and stuck on the
 idea that there is some thing that is a wild human a pure human organism withouttechnology but I don't think that's a
 real thing I think that humans and human technologyare one or
 Gizem look at my glasses okay if an alien came down and saw me would theynecessarily know that this is an
 invention that I don't grow these organically from my body they wouldn'tknow that right away and the written
 word and spoons and cups these are all pieces of technology we are not alone asan organism and so the technology we
 create whether it be video games or artificial intelligence that canself-replicate and hate us it's actually
 all the same organism I when you're in a car where do you end in the car begin itseems like a really easy question to
 answer but the more you think about it the more you realize wow we are in thissymbiotic relationship with our
 inventions and there are plenty of people who are worried about it andthere should be but it's it's inevitable


0:37:35
Speaker 0 :and I think the even just us think of
 ourselves as individual intelligences maybe silly notion because you know it'smuch better to think of the entirety of
 human civilization living all living organs on earth as a single livingorganism right as a single intelligent
 creature because you're right everything's intertwined everything isdeeply connected so we mention Elon Musk
 see you're a curious lover of science what do you think of the efforts thatElon Musk is doing with space
 exploration with electric vehicles with autopilot sort of getting into the spaceof autonomous vehicles was boring under
 la and neural link trying to communicate brain machine interfaces communicatebetween machines and human brains well


0:38:29
Speaker 1 :it's really inspiring I mean look at the
 fandom that he's amassed it's it's not common for someone like that to havesuch a following until you're a nerd
 yeah so it's really it's really exciting but I also think that a lot ofresponsibility comes with that kind of
 power so like if I met him I would love to hear how he feels about theresponsibility he has when when there
 our people who are such a fan of your ideas and your dreams and share them soclosely with you you have a lot of power
 and he didn't always have that you know he wasn't born as Elon Musk's well hewas but well he was named that later but
 the point is that that that I I want to know the psychology of becoming a figurelike him well I don't even know how to
 phrase the question right but it's a question about what do you do when youwere you're following your fans become
 so you know large that it's almost bigger than you and how do you how doyou responsibly manage that and maybe it
 doesn't worry him at all and that's fine too but I'd be really curious and Ithink there are a lot of people that go
 through this when they realize whoa there are a lot of eyes on me there area lot of people who really take what I
 say very earnestly and and take it to heart and will defend me and who that'sthat's some that that can be dangerous
 and and you have to be responsible with

0:40:07
Speaker 0 :it both in terms of impact in society
 and psychologically for the individual just just the the burden psychologically

0:40:14
Speaker 1 :Annie on yeah yeah how does he how does
 he think about that part of his persona

0:40:21
Speaker 0 :well let me throw that right back at you
 because in some ways you're just a funny guy that gotten a humongous following afunny guy with a curiosity mm-hmm
 you've got a huge following how do you psychologically deal with theresponsibility in many ways you ever
 reach in many ways bigger than you are

0:40:45
Speaker 1 :musk what is your what is the burden


0:40:46
Speaker 0 :that you feel in educating being one of
 the biggest educators in the world where everybody's listening to you andactually everybody like that most of the
 world that uses YouTube for educational material trust you as a source of goodstrong scientific thinking it's a burden


0:41:07
Speaker 1 :and
 I try to approach it with a lot of humility and sharing like I'm not outthere doing a lot of scientific
 experiments I am sharing the work of real scientists and I'm celebratingtheir work and the way that they think
 and the power of curiosity but I want to make it clear at all times that likelook you know we don't know all the
 answers and I don't think we're ever going to reach a point where we're likewow and there you go that's the universe
 it's this equation you plug in some conditions or whatever and you do themath and you know what's gonna happen
 tomorrow I don't think we're gonna reach that point but I I think that there is atendency to sometimes believe in science
 and become elitist and become I don't know hard when in reality it shouldhumble you and make you feel smaller I
 think there's something very beautiful about feeling very very small and veryweak and to feel that you need other
 people hmm so I try to keep that in mind and say look thanks for watching Vsauceis not I'm not Vsauce
 you are when I start the episodes I say hey Vsauce Michael hereVsauce and Michaels are actually a
 different thing in my mind I don't know if that's always clear but yeah I haveto approach it that way because it's not
 about me yeah so it's not even you're

0:42:30
Speaker 0 :not feeling the responsibility you're
 just sort of plugging into this big thing that is scientific exploration ofour reality and you're a voice that
 represents a bunch but you're just plugging into this big Vsauce ball thatothers millions of others have plugged


0:42:50
Speaker 1 :into yeah I'm just hoping to encourage
 curiosity and you know we're responsible thinking and an embracement of doubt andbeing okay with that so next week


0:43:05
Speaker 0 :talking to Chris Osgood row I'm not sure
 if you familiar who he is but he's the VP of engineering head of the quoteunquote YouTube algorithm this search
 and Discovery's yeah

0:43:17
Speaker 1 :let me ask first high level do you have


0:43:18
Speaker 0 :do you have a question


0:43:22
Speaker 1 :

0:43:24
Speaker 0 :for him that if you can get an ounce
 honest answer that you would ask but more generally how do you think aboutthe YouTube algorithm that drives some
 of the motivation behind not know some of the design decisions you make as youask and answer some of the questions you
 do how would you improve this algorithm in your mind in general so just the whatwould you ask him and outside of that
 how would you like to see the algorithm improve well I think of the algorithm as

0:43:52
Speaker 1 :a mirror it reflects what people put in
 and we don't always like what we see in that mirror

0:44:01
Speaker 0 :from the individual mirror to the
 individual Meritor of the society both

0:44:04
Speaker 1 :in the aggregate it's reflecting back
 what people on average want to watch and when you see things being recommended toyou it's reflecting back what it thinks
 you want to see and specifically I would guess that it's not just what you wantto see but what you will click on and
 what you will watch some of and stay on YouTube because of I don't think that isall me guessing but I don't think that
 YouTube cares if you only watch like a second of a video as long as the nextthing you do is open another video if
 you close the app or close the site that's a problem for them becausethey're not a subscription platform
 they're not like look you're giving us 20 bucks a month no matter what so whocares they need you to watch and spend
 time there and see ads so what one of

0:45:02
Speaker 0 :the things I'm curious about whether
 they do consider longer term sort of develop you your longer-term developmentas a human being which I think
 ultimately will make you feel better about using YouTube in the long term andallowing you to stick with it for longer
 because even if you feed the dopamine rush in the short-term and you keepclicking on cat videos the eventually
 you sort of wake up like from a drug and say I need to quit this so I wonder howmuch they're trying to optimize for the
 long term because when I look at the you know your videos aren'tand sort of no offense but they're not
 the most clickable they're both the most clickable and I feel I watch the entirething and I feel a better human after I
 watch it right so like they're not for just optimizing for the click ability isI hope so my thought is how do you think
 of it and this would affect your own content like how deep you go howprofound you explore the directions and


0:46:06
Speaker 1 :so on I I've been really lucky in that I
 don't worry too much about the algorithm I mean look at my thumbnails I don'treally go too wild with them and with
 minefield where I'm in partnership with YouTube on the thumbnails I'm often likelet's pull this back let's be mysterious
 but usually I'm just trying to do what everyone else is not doing so ifeveryone's doing crazy Photoshop kind of
 thumbnails I'm like what if the thumbnails just align yeah and what ifthe title is just a word yeah and I I
 kind of feel like all of the Vsauce channels of cultivating an audience thatexpects that and so they would rather
 Jake make a video that's just called stains then one called I explored stainsis shocking yeah but there are other
 audiences out there that want that and you know I think most people kind of wedon't want what you see the algorithm
 favoring which is mainstream traditional celebrity and news kind of information Imean that's what makes YouTube really
 different than other streaming platforms no one's like what's going on in theworld I'll open up Netflix to find out
 but you do open up Twitter to find that out you open up Facebook you can open upYouTube because you'll see that the
 trending videos are like what happened amongst the traditional mainstreampeople in different industries and
 that's what's being shown and it's it's not necessarily YouTube saying we wantthat to be what you see it's that that's
 what people click on when they see ariana grande you know reads a loveletter from like her high school
 sweetheart they're like I want to see thatand when they see a video from me that's
 got some lines in math and it's called law and causes they're like well I meanthat I'm just on the bus like I don't
 have time to dive into a whole lesson so you know beforeget super mad at YouTube you should say
 really they're just reflecting back human behavior is there something you

0:47:56
Speaker 0 :would improve about the algorithm
 knowing of course that as far as we're concerned it's a black box or don't knowhow it works right and I don't think


0:48:05
Speaker 1 :that even anyone at YouTube really knows
 what it's doing they know what they've tweaked but then it learns I think thatit learns and it decides how to behave
 and sometimes there the YouTube employees are left going I don't knowmaybe we should like change the value of
 how much it you know worries about watch time and maybe it should worry moreabout something I don't know but I mean
 I would like to see I don't know what they're doing and not doing well is

0:48:31
Speaker 0 :there a conversation that you think they
 should be having just internally whether they're having it or not is theresomething should they be thinking about
 the long-term future should they be thinking about educational content andwhether that's educating about what just
 happened in the world today news or educational content like what you'reproviding which is asking big to have
 timeless questions about how the way the world works

0:48:56
Speaker 1 :well it's interesting like what should
 they think about because it's called YouTube not our tube and if that's why Ithink they have so many phenomenal
 educational creators yes you don't have shows like three blue one brown orphysics girl or Looking Glass universe
 or up an atom or brain scoop or I mean I could go on and on they aren't on amazonprime and netflix and and they don't
 have Commission shows from those platforms it's all organically happeningbecause there are people out there that
 want to share their passion for learning that want to share their curiosity andYouTube could you know promote those
 kinds of shows more but like first of all they probably wouldn't get as manyclicks and YouTube needs to make sure
 that the average user is always clicking and staying on the site they could stillpromote it more for the good of society
 but then we're making some really weird claims about what's good for societybecause I think that cat videos are also
 an incredibly important part of what it means to be a humanI mentioned this quote before from
 unamuno about look I've seen a cat estimate distances and calculate a jumpyou know more often and I've seen a cat
 cry and so things that that play with our emotions and make us feel things canbe cheesy and can feel cheap but like
 man that's very human and so even the dumbest vlog is still so important thatI don't think it I have a better claim
 to take its spot than it has to have

0:50:30
Speaker 0 :that spot so it puts a mirror to us the
 beautiful parts the ugly parts the shallow parts the Jeep ours you're right

0:50:37
Speaker 1 :what I would like to see is you know I
 miss the days when engaging with content on YouTube helped push it into mysubscribers timelines it used to be that
 when I liked a video say from veritasium it would show up in the feed on thefront page of the app or the website of
 my subscribers and I knew that if I liked a video I could send it a hundredthousand views or more that no longer is
 true but I think that was a good user experience when I subscribe to someonewhen I'm following them I want to see
 more of what they like I want them to also curate the feed for me and I thinkthat Twitter and Facebook are doing that
 and also some ways that are kind of annoying but I would like that to happenmore and I think we would see
 communities being stronger on YouTube if it was that way instead of YouTube goingwell technically Michael like this
 veritasium video but people are way more likely to click on carpool karaoke so Idon't even care who they are just given
 that not saying anything against carpool karaoke that is a extremely importantpart of our society what it means to be
 a human on earth you know but I'll say

0:51:47
Speaker 0 :it sucks but uh yeah but a lot of people


0:51:49
Speaker 1 :would disagree with you and they should
 be able to see as much of that as they want yes and even people who don't thinkthey like it should still be really
 aware of it because it's such an important thing and such an influentialthing but yeah I just wish that like new
 channels I discover and that I subscribe to I wish that my subscribers found outabout that because especially in the
 education community a rising tide floats all boats if you watch a video fromnumber file you're just more likely to
 want to watch an episode from me whether it be on Vsauceone or ding it's not it's not
 competitive in the way that traditional TV was where it's like well if you tunedin to that show it means you're not
 watching mine because they both air at the same time so helping each other outthrough collaborations takes a lot of
 work but just through engaging commenting on their videos liking theirvideos subscribing to them whatever that
 I would love to see become easier and more powerful so a quick and impossibly

0:52:42
Speaker 0 :deep question last question about
 mortality you've spoken about death as an interesting topic do you think aboutyour own mortality


0:52:55
Speaker 1 :yeah every day it's really scary so what


0:53:00
Speaker 0 :do you think is the meaning of life that
 mortality makes very explicit so why are you here on earth Michael what's the

0:53:15
Speaker 1 :point of this whole thing what you know


0:53:20
Speaker 0 :what does mortality in the context of
 the whole universe make you realize about yourself just you Michael Stevens

0:53:28
Speaker 1 :well it makes me realize that I am
 destined to become an ocean I'm destined to become a memory and we can extendlife I think there's really exciting
 things being done to extend life but we still don't know how to like you knowprotect you from some accident that
 could happen you know some unforeseen thing maybe we could like save myconnectome and like recreate my
 consciousness digitally but even that is could it could be lost if it's stored ona physical medium or something so
 basically I just think that embracing and realizing how cool it is that likesome day I will just be an idea and
 there won't be a Michael anymore that can be like no that's not what I meantit'll just be what people like they have
 to guess what I meant and they'll remember me and how I live on and asthat memory you will will maybe not even
 be who I wanted to be but there's somethingpowerful about that and there's
 something powerful about letting future people run the show themselves I think II'm glad to get out of their way at some
 point and say all right it's your world now so you the physical entity michael

0:54:45
Speaker 0 :has have ripple effects in the space of
 ideas that far out lives you yeah in ways you can't control but it'snevertheless fascinating to think I mean
 especially with you you can imagine an alien species when they finally arriveand destroy all of us would watch your
 videos to try to figure out what what

0:55:05
Speaker 1 :were the questions but even if they
 didn't you know I still think that there will be ripples like when I say memory Idon't specifically mean people remember
 my name and my birthdate and have like there's a photo of me on Wikipedia likeall that can be lost but I still would
 hope that people ask questions and and and teach concepts in some of the waysthat I have found useful and satisfying
 even they don't know that I was the one who tried to popularize it that's finebut if Earth was completely destroyed
 like burnt to a crisp everything on it todaywhat would the universe wouldn't care
 like Jupiter's not gonna go oh no and that could happen because so we dohowever have the power to you know
 launch things into space to try to extend how long our memory exists andwhat I mean by that is you know we are
 recording things about the world and we're learning things and writingstories and all of this and preserving
 that is truly what I think is the essence of being a human we are Autobiographers of the universe and we're
 really good at it we're better than fossils were better than light spectrumwe're better than any of that we collect
 much more detailed memories of what's happening much better data and so thatshould be our legacy and I hope that
 that's that's kind of mine too in terms of people remembering something orhaving some kind of effect
 but even if I don't you can't not have an effect right that's the thing this isnot me feeling like I hope that I have
 this powerful legacy it's like no matter who you are you will but you also haveto embrace the fact that that impact
 might look really small and that's okay one of my favorite quotes is from Tessof the d'Urbervilles and it's along the
 lines of the the measure of your life depends on not your externaldisplacement but your subjective
 experience if I am happy and those that I love are happy can that be enoughbecause if so excellent I think there's


0:57:21
Speaker 0 :no better place to end it Michael thank
