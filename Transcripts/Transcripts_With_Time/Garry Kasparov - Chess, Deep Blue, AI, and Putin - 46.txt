Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Gary Kasparov he's considered by many to be the greatest chess player of all timefrom 1986 until his retirement in 2005
 he dominated the chess world ranking world number one for most of those 19years while he has many historical
 matches against human chess players in a long arc of history he may be rememberedfor his match against the machine IBM's
 deep blue his initial victories and eventual loss to deep blue captivatedthe imagination of the world of what
 role artificial intelligence systems may play in our civilizations future thatexcitement inspired an entire generation
 of AI researchers including myself to get into the field gary is also apro-democracy political thinker and
 leader a fearless human rights activist and author of several books includinghow life imitates chess which is a book
 on strategy and decision-making winter is comingwhich is a book articulating his
 opposition to the Putin regime and deep thinking which is a book on the role ofboth artificial intelligence and human
 intelligence in defining our future this is the artificial intelligence podcastif you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube

 Fri D ma a.m. and now here's my conversation with

0:01:31
Speaker 0 :Garry Kasparov


0:01:32
Speaker 1 :as perhaps the greatest chess player of
 all time when you look introspectively your psychology throughout your careerwhat was the bigger motivator the love
 of winning or the hatred of losing tough

0:01:45
Speaker 0 :question I have to confess I never heard
 it before each is again congratulations it's quitean accomplishment losing was always
 painful for me it was almost like a physical pain because I knew that if Ilost the game it's just because I made a
 mistake so it I always believed that the result of the game had to be decided bythe quality of my play okay you may say
 it sounds arrogant but it helped me to move forward because I always knew thatthere was room for improvement so it's


0:02:30
Speaker 1 :the was there the fear the mistake


0:02:32
Speaker 0 :actually fear of mistake guarantees
 mistakes and the difference between top players and very top is that it's theability to make a decision without
 predictable consequences you don't know what's happening it's intuitively I cango this way or that way and they're
 always hesitations people like your you're just you know at the crossroadyou can go right you can go left you can
 go straight you can turn and go back and the consequences are just very uncertainyes you have certain ideas what happens
 on the right or on the left or on just you know if you go straight but it's notenough to make well calculated choice
 and when you play chess at the very top is it's it's it's about your innerstrength so I can make this decision I
 will stand firm and I'm not going to waste my time because I feel confidencethat I will go through going back to the
 original question is I would say neither it's just it's the it's love for winninghateful losing there were important
 elements psychological elements but the key element it's the I would say the thedriving force was
 always my passion for for making it make any difference it's just I can moveforward and I can always its I can
 always enjoy not just playing but creating something new creating

0:04:01
Speaker 1 :something new how do you think about


0:04:04
Speaker 0 :that it's just finding new ideas in the
 openings you know some regional plan in the middle game it's actually thathelped me to make the transition from
 the game of chess where I wasn't a very top two to another life where I knew Iwould not be number one I would don't be
 necessarily on the top but I could still be very active and productive by myability to make the difference by
 influencing people say joining the democratic movement in Russia or talkingto people about human-machine relations
 there's so many things were I knew my influence may not be as decisive as inchess but still strong enough to help
 people to make their choices so you can

0:04:51
Speaker 1 :still create something new that makes a
 difference in the world outside of chess but wait you've kind of painted abeautiful picture of your motivations to
 chess to create something new to look for those moments of some brilliant newideas but were you haunted by something
 see you make it seem like to be at the level you are at you can get awaywithout having demons without without
 having fears without being driven if by

0:05:25
Speaker 0 :some of the darker forces I mean you
 sound almost religious you know dark forces to reach you know humans and wedo have a pole for a priest now just
 let's go back to you to to these crucial chess moments where I had to make bigdecisions as I said it's it's you know
 it was all about my belief from very early days that I can make all thedifference by playing well or by making
 mistakes so the yes I I always had an opponent across the chessboard oppositeme
 but no matter how strong their point was well they just were ordered player oranother wall champion I can't leak or
 proof I haven't called respect for my opponent I still believe that it's it'sup to me to make the difference and I I
 knew I I was not invincible I made mistakes I made some blunders and youknow with age I mean more blunders okay
 good I knew it but it's it's still you know it's it's very much for me to bedecisive factor in the game I mean even
 now look I just you know my latest chess experience was horrible I mean I getplayed carolallan Khurana fatphobia
 Khurana it's number two number two number three player well these days weplay this 960 which they fish for so
 call Fisher a random chairs from shuffling pieces yeah I lost very badlybut it's because I made mistakes I mean
 I had so many winning positions I mean 15 years ago I would have crushed him soand it's it's you know while I lost I
 got so much upset I mean I know as I said in my interview I can fight anyopponent but not my biological clock
 it's fighting time with is is is always a losing proposition but even today atage 56 you know I I knew that you know I
 could play great game I couldn't finish it because I didn't have enough energyor just you know I couldn't have the
 same level concentration but you know in number of games where I completelyoutplayed one of the top players in the
 world I mean gave me a certain amount of pleasure that is even today I haven'tlost my touch not the same you know okay
 the jaws are not as as strong and DTS are another sharp but I could get himjust you know almost you know two on the
 ropes Oh got it it's still got it and that's you know and it's it's my wifesaid it well I mean she said look Gary
 it's somehow it's something you just fighting viola your biological clockit's just you know maybe it's a signal
 because you know the goddess of chess since you spoke lean religious thegoodness of chess Keysha maybe she
 didn't wound you twin because you know if you could beat number- number three pride in the world I mean
 this is this one of the better top players who just recently played WorldChampionship match if you could beat him
 it's that was really bad for the game of chess just what people who say oh lookthe game of chess you know it's it's
 it's not make any progress the game is just you know it's it's totally devaluedbecause Italy the guy coming out of
 retirement you know just you know winning games maybe that was good forchess not good for you but it's okay
 I've been following your logic we should always look for you know demons you knowsuperior forces and other things that
 did you know if not dominate our lives but somehow in a play a significant rolein in the outcome yeah so the goddess's


0:08:55
Speaker 1 :chess had to send a message yeah okay


0:08:58
Speaker 0 :okay so Gary you should do something
 else time now for a question that you have

0:09:03
Speaker 1 :heard before but give me a chance
 you've dominated the chess world for twenty years even still got it is therea moment you said you always look to
 create something new is there is there games or moments where you're especiallyproud of in terms of your brilliance of
 a new creative move we've talked about mikhail tall as somebody who wasaggressive and creative chess player in
 your own game look

0:09:33
Speaker 0 :you mentioned mikhail call it's very
 aggressive very sharp player famous ways combinations and sacrifices even calledmagician from riga so for his very
 unique style but any any world champion you know it's yeah was a creator some ofthem were so flamboyant and flash like
 call some of their world no just you know less discerned at the chessboardlike Tigran Petrosian but every world
 champion every top player brought something into the game of chess andeach contribution was priceless because
 it's not just about sacrifices of course amateurs they enjoy you know thebrilliant games where pieces being
 sacrificed it's all just you know pieces are hanging and and it's all of a suddenyou know being material down rube
 or just you know queen down the the the weaker side delivers the the final blowon just you know amazing opponent's king
 but this there are other kinds of beauty slow positioning when you ring you knowlooking for witnesses and just and and
 gradually really strangling your opponent and eventually delivering sortof a positional masterpiece
 yeah so I think I I made more difference in the game of chess then I could Icould have imagined when I started
 playing and the reason I thought it was time for me to leave is just I mean Iknew that I was not I was not no longer
 the position to bring bring the same kind of contribution the same kind ofnew knowledge into the game so and going
 back I could immediately look at my games again sounds only corpus not justI won the match in 1985 and became world
 champion at age 22 but there were at least two games in that match of coursethe last one game 24 that was decisive
 game of the match i won and became world champion but also theway a wise was it was a very hard game
 and i found a unique maneuver that was absolutely new and it became some sortof just a typical now though just when
 the move was made was made at the on the board and put on display a lot of peoplethought it was ugly so and another game
 game 16 and the match or I just also managed to outlay Karpov completely wasblack pieces just you know paralyzing
 his entire army in its own its own camp

0:12:13
Speaker 1 :technically or psychologically or was
 that a mix of both in game 16 yeah it I

0:12:17
Speaker 0 :think it was a big blow to Karpov I
 think it was a big psychological victory for a number of reasons one the scorewas equal at a time and the world
 champion you know by the rules could retain his title in case of a tie so westill have no before game 16 we have
 nine games to go and also it was some sort of a bluff becauseneither me nor Karpov saw the reputation
 of this opening idea and and I think it says for carpel it was double blowbecause not that he lost the game I
 should triple blow he lost the game it was a brilliant game and I playedimpeccably after you know justice this
 opening Bluff and then you know they discovered that it was a bluff so it'sthe again I didn't know it I wasn't
 bluffing so that's why by it happens very oftenit's when you know some ideas could be
 refuted and it's just what I found out and this is again going back to your youknow spiritual theme is that and it's
 you could spend a lot of time working and when I say you could it's just it'sit's in the 80s in the 90s it does
 happen these days because everybody has a computer you could immediately see ifit works or it doesn't work
 machines show the refutation in the split of a second but many of the ouranalysis in the eighties or in the 90s
 they were not perfect simply because we're humans and they're just you youanalyze the game you look for some fresh
 ideas and then test it happens that there was something that you missedbecause the level of concentration
 at the chessboard it's different from one that when you analyze the game justmoving the pieces around but somehow if
 you spend a lot of time at the chessboard preparing so in your studieswith your coaches hours and hours and
 hours and nothing of what you found could had materialized on the our ownchests on the chess board somehow these
 hours helped I don't know I always helped you it's it's as if you know theamount of work you did could be
 transformed into some sort of spiritual energy that helped you to come up withother great ideas during the board again
 even if it was there was no direct connection between your preparation andyour victory in the game there was
 always some sort of invisible connection between the amount of work you did yourdedication to actually to you and your
 passion to discover new ideas and your ability during the game add the chessboard when the clock was ticking we
 still had ticking clock not so to come up with some some somebrilliancy and them and I also can
 mention many games from the 90s so it's the obviously all amateurs would pick upmy game against Veselin Topalov in 1999
 and we can say again because it was a Bruin gamethe black king traveled from from its
 own camp to into D into in the white scam across the entire board it doesn'thappen often trust me as you know in in
 in indie games were professional players top professional players so that's why Ivisually it was one of the most
 impressive victories but I could bring to your attention many other games thatwere not so impressive for for amateurs
 not so note so beautiful just guess it's sacrifice always beautiful yousacrificed asses and then and then
 eventually you have so there are very few resources left and you you you usethem just to to to to crush your your
 opponent basically to it's you have to make the kink because you have almostalmost nothing nothing nothing left at
 your disposal but I you know I up to the very end in less and less but still upto the very end I always had games with
 some sort of you know interesting ideas and and games that gave me greatsatisfaction but I think it's what
 happened from 2005 up to you these days was also a very very big accomplishmentsince you know I had to find myself to
 sort of relocate myself yeah we channel

0:16:29
Speaker 1 :the creative energies exactly do you


0:16:31
Speaker 0 :find something worth feel comfortable
 even confident that my participation still makes the difference beautifully

0:16:40
Speaker 1 :put
 so let me ask perhaps a silly question but sticking our chests for just alittle longer
 where do you put Magnus Carlsen in the current world champion in a list of alltime greats in terms of style moments of
 brilliance consistency it's a tricky

0:16:57
Speaker 0 :question you know the moment you start
 ranking yeah well do something it's the I think it's it'sit's not fair because it's any new
 generation knows much more about the game than their previous one so whenpeople say Gary was the greatest Fischer
 was the greatest Magnus was the greatest it disregard the fact that the greatplayers of the past where the last year
 have a plank looking I mean they knew so little about chess by today's standardstoday just any kid you know that spent
 few years you know and uh with his or her chess computer when knows much moreabout the game simply just because you
 actually have access to this information and it has been discovered generationafter generation we added more and more
 knowledge to the game of chess it's about the gap between the world championand the rest of the field so it's the
 now if you look at the gap then proud official you know could be on top butvery short period of time then you
 should also add a time factor yeah I was on top not as big as but but much longerso so and also unlike Fischer I will
 succeed in beating next generation yeah

0:18:12
Speaker 1 :here's the question yeah let's see if
 you still got the fire speaking of the next generation because you did succeedbeating the next generation it's close


0:18:19
Speaker 0 :okay well Anand short Anand the sheer of
 chromic is already 12 years younger so that's a neck that's but still yet I Icompeted with them and I just had beat
 most of them and and I was still dominant when I left at age of the 41 soback to Magnus Madras right consistency
 is phenomenal the reason Magnus is on top and it seemsunbeatable today Magnus is is a lethal
 combination of Fischer on Karpov but just very it's very unusual becauseFischer style was very dynamic just
 fighting to the last point just using every resource available Karpov was verydifferent as just yet an unparalleled
 ability to use the every piece with a maximum effect just it's minimalresources always produce maximum effects
 just so now imagine that you merge these two styles say oh it is it's it's likeyou know it's a squeezing every stone
 for drop of water but but doing it you know just you know for 50 60 70 80 movesI mean mangas could go on as long as
 Fisher who is always passion and energy and at the same time being as meticulousand and and and deadly as corporal by
 just you know using every little advantage so and yes good you know verygood else it's important I mean physical
 conditions are by the way very important so a lot of people don't recognize ittheir latest study shows that chess
 players burn thousands of calories during the game so that puts him on thetop of this fuel of of the wall chambers
 but again it's the discussion that is I so recently in internet whether garrykasparov always peek let's say late 80s
 could be Magnus Carlsen today I mean something irrelevant because garriga'sprobably 1989 okay it's played great
 chess but still I knew very little about chess compared to Magnus crossing 2019who Biden will learn from me as well so
 that's why yeah I'm extremely cautious in making anyjudgment that involves you know time
 gaps you ask you know soccer fans so who is your favorite Pele Maradona or Messiyeah yeah who's your favorite Messi miss
 because maybe because he's younger but that's simple your instinct answer iscorrect because you saw you didn't say
 marathon in action I saw all of them in action so that's why but it's but sinceyou know when I was you know just
 following it in air just it's pillion and Maradona they were just you knowthere were big stars and it's Macy's
 already just get I I was gradually losing interest other things so Iremember Pele 1970 the final match
 Brazil Italy so that's the first world war World Cup soccer I watched so that'sthe and and actually my answer when it
 just where that just you know I because I I was asked this question as well so Isay that is this while it's impossible
 to make a choice I would sue probably go with Maradona for simple reason theBrazilian team in 1970 could have won
 without Collette it was absolutely great still could have wonmaybe but it is the Argentinian team in
 1986 without Maradona would not be in the 5s so this is and Messi he still hasthat's not good argue for that for an
 hour but yes you could say if you ask

0:21:36
Speaker 1 :Maradona if you look in his eyes
 especially let's say Gary Kasparov 99 he would have said I was sure as hell wouldbe magnus carlsen it's just simply the


0:21:48
Speaker 0 :confidence fire simply because simply
 because again it's just a so mean action so this again it's it's the age factoras important therefore is a passion and
 energy and and being equipped with all modern ideas but again then you make ina very just important assumption that
 you could empower Gary Kasparov 89 with all ideas that have been accumulatedover 30 years that would not be Garrigus
 part that would be someone else because again I belong to 1989 I was way aheadof the field and I you know a bit Karpov
 several times in World Championship matches and I crossed 2,800 which by theway if you look at the chest in rating
 which is just it's even today so this is this is the rating that I retire so thatsays it's still you know it's just it's
 a it's a top two to three so that says this is kerwin and eaglets about thesame rating now and I crossed 2,100 in
 1990 we just look at the inflation when I cross 2,800 in in 1990 there was onlyone player in 2700 category Anatoly
 Karpov now he had more than 50 so just you see thisso if you add inflation so I think my
 28:51 it could probably could be more valuable as Magnus 2882 which washighest rating but anyway yeah you know


0:23:06
Speaker 1 :so many hypotheticals you're lost to IBM
 gee blue in 1997 in my eyes there's one of the most seminal moments in thehistory again I apologize for being
 romanticized in the notion but in the history of our civilization becausehumans as the civilizations for century
 saw chess as you know the peak of what man can accomplish of intellectualmastery right and that moment when a
 machine could beat a human being was inspiring to just an entire anyone whocares about science innovation
 the entire generation of AI researchers and yet to you that laws at least ifreading your face was seemed like a
 tragedy extremely painful like you said physically painful why when you lookback at your psychology that lost why
 was it so painful when you're not able to see the seminal nature of that moment

0:24:05
Speaker 0 :Oh


0:24:06
Speaker 1 :or was that exactly why was that


0:24:09
Speaker 0 :powerful as I already said losing was
 painful physically passing and the match I lost in 1997 was not the first match Ilost to a machine it was the first match
 I lost period yes that's oh yeah it's right yeah thatmakes all the difference to me yes first
 time I lost it's just now I lost and the reason I was so angry that I just youknow I had suspicions that my loss was
 not just the result of my bad play yes SoDo I played quite poorly you know justwhen you started looking at the games
 today I made tons of mistakes but you know I had all reasons to believe thatyou know there were other other factors
 that had nothing to do with the game of chess and that's what I was angry butlook it was 22 years ago
 it's what under the bridge we can analyze this match and this is witheverything you said I I agree it was
 probably one exception is that considering chess you know as the sortof as a pinnacle of intellectual
 activities what's our mistake because you know wejust thought oh it's a it's a game of
 the highest intellect and I just you know you have to be so you knowintelligent and as you could see things
 that you know the or the ordinary ordinary mortals could not see it's agame and all machines had to do with
 this game is just to make fewer mistakes not to solve the game because the gamecannot be solved I mean according to
 Shannon the number of legal moves is ten to the 46 power too many zeroes for anycomputer to finish the job you know in
 in in neck billion years but it doesn't have toit's all about making fewer mistakes and
 I think that's the this match actually and what's happened afterwards withother games with go with shrug II with
 video games it's a demonstration that it's the machines will always beathumans in what I call closed systems the
 moment you build a closed system no matter how this system is called chessgo
 froggie daughter machines will prevail simply because they will bring downnumber of mistakes machines don't have
 to solve it they just have to it's the way they outplay us it's not by justbeing more intelligent it's just by by
 doing something else but eventually it's just it's capitalizing on our mistakeswhen you look at the chess machines
 ratings today in compare compare this to Magnus Carlsen is the same as comparingFerrari to Hussein bold it's the the gap
 is is I meant by chess standards is insane thirty four thirty five hundredto twenty eight hundred twenty eight
 twenty eight twenty eight fifty one man knows it's like difference betweenmacros and AB and an ordinary player
 from an open international tournament it's not because machine understandsbetter than magnus carlsen but simply
 because it's steady machine has steady hand and I think that is what we we wehave to learn from 1997 experience and
 from further encounters with computers and sort of the the current state stateof affairs was alpha zero you beating
 other machines the idea that we can compete with computers in so-calledintellectual fields it's it was wrong
 from the very beginning it's just it's by the way if 1997 match was not thefirst victory of machines over our
 masters or masters yeah no actually it's I played against first decent chesscomputers from late from late 80s so I
 played with the prototype of deep blue called deep thought in 1989 to repeatchest
 in New York I want handily those games we played against new chess engines likeFritz and other programs and then it
 Steve was Israeli problem jr. that appeared in yeah so there were severalproblems I you know I lost few games in
 blitz I lost one match against the computer a chess engine 1994 rapid chessso I lost one game 2d blue in 1996 match
 the manner the match chef I want some people you know tend to forget about itthat I won the first match yes
 but it's it's we we made a very important psychological mistake thinkingthat the reason we lost blitz matches
 five five minutes games the reason we lost some of the rapid chess matchestwenty five minutes just because we
 didn't have enough time if you play a longer match we will not make the samemistake nonsense so this yeah we had
 more time but we still make mistakes and machine also has more time and machinesmachine will always you know I will
 always be stated inconsistent compared to humans instabilities andinconsistencies and today we are at a
 point where yes nobody talks about you know humans playing use machinesmachines can offer handicap two to two
 top players still you know will will will be favoring I think we're justlearning that is it's it's no longer
 human versus machines it's about human working with machines that's what Irecognized in 1998 just after licking my
 wounds and spending one year in just in a ruminating Saudi so what's happened atin this match and I knew that though we
 still could play against the machines I had two more matches in 2003 playingboth a deep freeze and deep jr. both
 matches and there's a tie mmm-hmm though this machines were not weaker at least Ipromise stronger and II blue and by the
 way today just app on your mobile phone is probably stronger than the blueindividual I'm not speaking of any bit
 about chess engines that are so much superior and by the way when you analyzegames who played against the blue 90 97
 on your chess engine they'll be laughing yeah so this is and it's also showsthat's how it just changed because
 just commentators they look at some of our games like game for Game five andidea now you asked stockfish you asked
 Houdini you asked Commodore all the leadingchess engines yeah within 30 seconds
 they will show you how many mistakes booze Gary and D blue mate in the gamethat was from Pettitte as the as a great
 chess match in 1997 well okay so you've

0:30:51
Speaker 1 :made an interesting if you can untangle
 that comment so now in retrospect it was a mistake to see chess as the peak ofhuman intellect nevertheless that was
 done for centuries

0:31:07
Speaker 0 :so even in Europe because you know you
 move to the far east they will go there shogi games again I guess some of thegames like you look our board games yes
 yes yeah so if I push back a little bit

0:31:22
Speaker 1 :so now you say that okay but it was a
 mistake to see chess as the epitome and now and then now there's other thingsmaybe like language that conversation
 like some of the things that in your view is still way out of reach ofcomputers but inside humans do you think
 can you talk about what those things might be and do you think just likechess that might fall soon with the same
 set of approaches if you look at alpha zero the same kind of learningapproaches as the machines grow in size


0:31:58
Speaker 0 :no no it's not about in size it's about
 again it's about understanding the difference but in closed system anopen-ended system so you think that key


0:32:05
Speaker 1 :difference so the board games are closed
 in terms of the rules that they actions simple the state spaceeverything is just constrained you think
 once you open it the machines are lost

0:32:19
Speaker 0 :not lost but again the effectiveness is
 very different because machine does not understand the moment it's reaching theterritory of diminishing returns hmm
 it's the simple in a different way machine doesn't know how to ask rightquestions it can ask questions but
 we'll never tell you which questions are relevant so this D it's like about theit's the it's a direction so these it's
 I think is in human relations we have to consider so our role and people manypeople feel uncomfortable that is the
 territory that that belongs to us is is shrinking I'm saying so what you know isthis is eventually will belong to the
 last few decimal points but it's like having so very powerful gun that's andand and and all you can do there is
 slightly you know alter direction of the bullet maybe you know point one thedegree of this angle but that means a
 mile away ten meters of tourists so so that's we have to recognize that is acertain unique human qualities that
 machine's in the foreseeable future will not be able to reproduce and and theeffectiveness of this cooperation
 collaboration depends on our understanding what exactly we can bringinto the game so the greatest danger is
 when we try to interfere with machines superior knowledge so that's why Ialways say that sometimes you'd rather
 have by reading these pictures in radiology you may probably prefer anexperienced nurse then rather than
 having top professor because she will not try to interfere with machinesunderstanding so this it's very
 important to know that if machines knows how to do better things in 95% 96% ofterritory we should not touch it because
 it's it happened we it's like in chess recognize they they do it better seewhere we can make the difference you
 mentioned alpha 0 alpha 0 it's a it's actually a first step into what you maycall AI because everything that's being
 called AI today is just it's it's it's one or another variation of what ClaudeShannon characterized as a brute force
 is a type a machine whether it's deep blue whether its what's in it and allthese the modern technologies that are
 being competitors as AI it's still boot force it's the all video it's they dooptimization it's this they are you know
 they they keep you know improving the way toprocess human generated data hmm now
 alpha zero is is the first step towards you know machine produced knowledge yeswhich is why what by the way it's quite
 ironic that the first company that jumped on that was ideal oh it's inbackgammon interesting in that again yes


0:35:14
Speaker 1 :

0:35:15
Speaker 0 :you just you should you should you
 should look at IBM is this it's a new gammon it's the it's the he's still

0:35:21
Speaker 1 :

0:35:22
Speaker 0 :working IBM they had in early nineties
 it says it's the it's in the program that played in LD alpha 0 type so justtrying to come up with own strategies
 but because of success of the blue this project had been not abandoned but justyou know it's it's it wasn't was put on
 call and now it just you know it's it's it's you know it's every talks aboutabout this t the machines generated
 knowledge so as a revolutionary and it is but there's still you know manyopen-ended questions yes
 alpha 0 generates its own data many ideas that alpha 0 generating chess workquite intriguing so I I looked at these
 games was not just with interest but was no it was quite exciting to learn howmachine could actually you know juggle
 all the pieces and just play positions with a broken material balancesacrificing material always being ahead
 of other programs you know one or two moves ahead by by foreseeing theconsequence not over calculating because
 machines other machines were at least as powerful in calculating but it's havingthis unique knowledge based on
 discovered patterns after playing 60 million games almost something like

0:36:37
Speaker 1 :feels like intuition exactly but there's


0:36:40
Speaker 0 :one problem
 yeah now the simple question if if alpha 0 faces superior point let's say anotherpowerful computer accompanied by human
 who could help just to discover certain problems because I already I look atmany alpha 0 games I visited their lab
 spoke to demis hassabis and his team and I I know that certain witnesses therenow if these wings are exposed and that
 question is how many games will it take for alpha zero to correct it the answeris hundreds of thousands even if it
 keeps losing it it's this because the whole system is based yes so it's nowimagine so that says you can have a
 human by just making few tweaks so humans are still more flexible and andas long as we recognize what is what is
 our raw where we can play sort of so the most valuable part in this collaborationso it's it will help us to understand
 what are the next steps in human machine collaboration beautifully put

0:37:40
Speaker 1 :so let's talk about the thing that
 machine's certainly don't know how to do yet which is morality machines and

0:37:46
Speaker 0 :morality but it's another question that
 I know just it's that's as being asked all the time these days and I I thinkit's another phantom that is haunting a
 general public because it's just being fed with this you know illusions is thathow can we vote machines you know having
 bias need prejudices you cannot because it's like looking in the mirror andcomplaining about what you see if you
 have certain bias in the society machine will will just follow it it's just it'sit's you know you look at the mirror you
 don't like what you see there you can you know you can break it you can try todistort it or you can try to actually
 change something just itself yes by yourself yes so it's very importantto understand is this is you cannot
 expect machines to to improve the ease of our society and moreover machineswill simply know just you know amplified
 yes yeah but the thing is people are

0:38:42
Speaker 1 :more comfortable with other people doing
 injustice would being biased we're not comfortable with machineshaving the same kind of bias so that's a
 that's an interesting standard that we place on machines with autonomousvehicles they have to be much safer with
 automated systems because they're much

0:39:04
Speaker 0 :safer statistically they're much safer
 than then of course why would they it's

0:39:08
Speaker 1 :not of course it's it's not given
 autonomous vehicles you have to work really hard to make them

0:39:17
Speaker 0 :is safer i I think it just goes without
 saying is the the outcome of the of this alcohol competition but comparison isvery clear but the problem is not about
 being in a safer it's the forty thousand people will show every year died in caraccidents United States and it's its
 statistics one accident ways with autonomous vehicle and it's front pageof a newspaper yeah this was cycle so
 it's while people you know kill each other in car accidents because they makemistakes they make more mistakes for me
 it's it's it's not a question of course we make more mistakes because we humanyes machines old and by the way no
 machine will ever reach hundred percent perfection that's not that that'sanother important take story that that
 that is being fed to the public if machine doesn't reach hundreds andperformance is not safe no all you can
 ask any computer whether it's you know playing chess or or doing the stockmarket calculations or driving your
 autonomous vehicle it's to make fewer mistakes and yes I know it's not youknow it's not easy for us to accept
 because ah if you know if you have to humansyou know colliding in their cars okay
 it's like if one of one of these cars is autonomous very vehicle and by the wayeven if it's humans fault
 terrible how could you allow a machine to do it you to run without driver ID atthe wheel
 so you know let's think of that for a

0:40:43
Speaker 1 :second that double standard the way you
 felt with your first loss against D blue were you treating the Machinedifferently than you would have a human
 or so what do you think about that difference between the way we seemachines and humans no it's a match and


0:41:02
Speaker 0 :that's why I was angry because I believe
 they're lost the match was not you know fairly organized so the statesdefinitely they were unfair advantages
 for for IBM and I want to play there another match like rubble mess

0:41:17
Speaker 1 :so you're angered or displeasure was a
 more like at the humans behind IBM versus the actual your absolute

0:41:24
Speaker 0 :algorithm absolutely look I I knew at
 the time and by the way I was objectively speaking I was stronger atthat time so that's that
 we added to my anger because I knew I could beat machine yeah yeah so this andthat's the and I lost and I knew I was
 not well prepared so because they I have to give them credit they did some goodwork from 1996 and I but I still could
 beat the machine so I made too many mistakes also this is the hole is thisthe publicity around the match so I
 underestimated the effect you know just it's Andy and being called the you knowthe the brains lost and ounce okay no
 pressure okay well let me ask so I was

0:42:02
Speaker 1 :born also in the Soviet Union what
 lessons do you draw from the rise and fall of the Soviet Unionin the 20th century when you just look
 at this nation that is now look I'm pushing forward into what Russia is ifyou look at the long arc of history of
 the 20th century what do we take away what do we take away from that I think

0:42:29
Speaker 0 :the lesson of history is clear
 undemocratic systems totalitarian regimes systems that are based oncontrolling their citizens and just
 every aspect of their life not offering opportunities to for private initiativecentral planning systems they duped they
 just you know they they cannot be driving force for innovation so they inin history timeline I mean they could
 cause certain you know distortion of the concept of progressthey by the way call themselves
 progressive but we know that is this the damage that they cost to to humanity isjust it's it's it's yet to be measured
 but at the end of the day they fail they fail and it's and the end of the ColdWar was a great triumph of the free
 world it's not that the free world is perfect it's very important to recognizeits factors I always like to mention you
 know one of my favorite books a lot of the Rings daddy there's no there's noabsolute good but there's an absolutely
 good you know it comes in many forms but we all you know it's humans or beingeven you know humans from fairy tales or
 just some sort of mystical creatures it's they you can always find spots onthe song so this is conducting war and
 just and fighting you for justice there are always things that you know can beeasily criticized and human history is
 the is a never-ending quest for perfection but we know that there isabsolutely you
 we know it's for me it's now clear that's I mean it's nobody argues aboutHitler being absolutely well but I think
 it's very poor against Stalin was absolutely communism caused more damagethan any other ideology in the 20th
 century and unfortunately while we all know that fascist was condemned butthere was no nerble for common communism
 and that's why we could see you know still is the these the successors ofStalin are feeling far more comfortable
 so you is one of them you highlight a

0:44:40
Speaker 1 :few interesting connections actually
 between Stalin and Hitler I mean there that in in terms of the adjusting orclarifying the the history of war to
 which they're interesting of course we don't have time so let me ask you I just

0:44:56
Speaker 0 :I just recently delivered a speech in
 Toronto yeah at a decent roast of Malta ribbon from pact it's something that Ibelieve you know just you know has must
 must be taught in the schools and the world what you had been started by todictators by signing these these
 criminal criminal treaty collusion of two tyrants in August 1939that
 the beginning of the world World War two and the fact that eventually Stalin hadno choice but to join allies because
 Hitler attack him so it just doesn't you know eliminated the fact that Stalinhelped Hitler to start World War two and
 he was one of the beneficiary said early at early stage by annexing part ofEastern Europe and as a result of the
 war with you he annexed always entire Eastern Europe and for many EasternEuropean nations the end of the world
 would you was the beginning of communist occupation hmm

0:45:50
Speaker 1 :so Putin you've talked about as a man
 who stands between Russia and democracy essentially today you've been a strongopponent and critic of Putin let me ask
 again how much does fear enter your mind and heart so in 2007 there's thisinteresting comment from Oleg Kalugin
 KGB general he said that I do not talk details people who knew them are alldead now because they were vocal I'm
 quiet there's only one man who's vocal and he may be in troubleWorld Chess Champion Kasparov he has
 been very outspoken in his attacks on Putin and I believe he's probably nexton the list so clearly your life has
 been and perhaps continues to be in danger how do you think about having theviews you have the ideas you have being
 in opposition as you are in this kind of context when your life could be in

0:46:54
Speaker 0 :danger oh that's the reason I live in
 New York so what's they was not my first choicebut I knew I had to leave Russia at one
 point and among other places New York is the safest is it safe no I meaninterested Steve I know what happens
 what happened what is happening who is many of Putin enemies but at the end ofthe day I mean what can I do it it's I I
 could be very proactive by trying to change things I can influence but hereare way effects I I cannot stop doing
 what I've been doing for a long time it's the right thing to do I grew upwith my family teaching me sort of the
 wisdom of Soviet dissidents do what you must and so be itI could try to be cautious by not
 traveling to certain places were you know my security could be at riskthere's so many invitations to speak at
 different locations in the world and I have to say that many countries are justnow are not destinations that I can
 afford to travel my mother still lives in Moscow and meet her a few times ayear she was devastated when I had to
 leave Russia because since my father died in 1971 so she was 33 and shededicated her entire life to her only
 son but she recognized in just a year or so since I left Russia that it was theonly chance for me to continue my normal
 life so just is to I mean to be relatively safe and to to do what shetaught me to do to make the difference
 do you think you will ever return to

0:48:36
Speaker 1 :Russia or oh I'm sure when it won't


0:48:41
Speaker 0 :sooner than many people think because I
 think Putin regime is facing insurmountable different difficultiesand again I read enough historical books
 to know that dictatorships they they end suddenly it's just on Sunday dictatorfeels comfortable he believes he's
 popular on Monday morning his bust the good news and bad news I mean the badnews is that I don't know when and how
 Putin rule ends the good news he also doesn't know

0:49:18
Speaker 1 :okay well put let me ask a question that
 seems to preoccupy the American mind from the perspective of Russia one didRussia interfere in the 2016 US election
 government-sanctioned and future two will rush into fear inthe 2020 US election and what does that
 interference look like

0:49:45
Speaker 0 :it's very old you know we had such an
 intelligent conversation and you are ruining everything by asking such ashealthy but it's it's insulting for my
 intellect okay of course they did interfere over horse they did absoleverything to elect Trump I mean they
 said it many times he this is you know I met enough KGB Colonels in my life totell you that you know just the way put
 it looks at Trump yeah this is the way Luke said I don't have to hear what hesays what Trump says it just is I don't
 need to go through congressional instigations the way he put it looks atTrump it's the way the KGB officers
 looked at the assets it's just and following to 20/20 of course they willdo absolutely everything to help Trump
 to survive because I think they damage that Trump's relations could cause toAmerica and to the free world it's just
 it's beyond one's imagination I think basically from was reelected she'll ruinNATO because he's already heading in
 this direction but now he's just he's still limited by the re-election hurdlesif he's still in the office after
 November 2020 okay January 2021 I don't think about it my problem is not justTrump because Trump is basically it's a
 symptom but the problem is that I don't see it just it's the in Americanpolitical horizon politicians who could
 take on Trump for for all damage that he's doing for the free world not justthings that that's happened that went
 wrong in America so this the it seems to me that the campaign political campaignon the Democratic side is is fixed on
 certain important but still second duration guess when you have thefoundation the Republican jeopardy I
 mean you cannot talk about health care I mean understand how important it is butit's still secondary because the a
 framework familiar political life is at risk and you have rather intrusion justyou know just it's having the free hands
 bye-bye he's by attacking America and other free countries and by doing wehave so much evidence about Russia
 intervals and brexit in elections in almost every European country andthinking that they will be shy of
 attacking America in 2020 now is we strong in the office yeah Ithink it's um yeah it definitely
 diminishes the intellectual quality falklands I do what I can

0:52:23
Speaker 1 :last question if you can go back just
 look at the entirety of your life you accomplished more than most humans willever do if you could go back and relive
 a single moment in your life what would

0:52:39
Speaker 0 :that moment be there are moments in my
 life when I think about what could be done differently but no experience

0:52:52
Speaker 1 :happiness and joy and pride
 just-just-just is this it's the it's

0:52:59
Speaker 0 :look I made many mistakes in my life so
 I just it's there I know that at the end of the day it's I believe in thebutterfly effect so is the it's the I
 knew moments where I could now if I'm there at that point in 89 in 93 pick upa year I could improve my actions by not
 doing this stupid thing but then how do you know that I will have all othercompliments yeah I just I'm I'm afraid
 that you know we just have to just follow this if you make all wisdombefore is Gumpy know it's the life as
 this you know it's this it's a box of affair of chocolate and you don't knowwhat's inside but you have to go one by
 one so it's the I'm I'm happy with who I am and where I am today and I am veryproud not only with my chess
 accomplishments but that I made this transition and since I left chess youknow i built my own reputation that had
 some influence of the game of chess but not it's not you know directly derivedfrom from the game I'm grateful for my
 wife so who helped me to build his life we actually married in 2005 it was mysure
 marriage that's why I said that make mistakes in my wife but I died by theway I'm close with two kids from my
 previous marriages so that's tasty I mean I managed to sort of to balance mylife and and hear it I live in New York
 so we have our two kids born here in New York it's its new life and it's you knowit's it's busy sometimes I wish I could
 you know I could limit my engagement in many other things that said I still youknow taking time and energy but life is
 exciting and as long as I can feel that I've energy I have strengths I havepassion to make the difference I'm happy
 I think that's a beautiful moment and on

0:54:57
Speaker 1 :Gary spicy buh-bye sure thank you very
 much for talking to me thank you
