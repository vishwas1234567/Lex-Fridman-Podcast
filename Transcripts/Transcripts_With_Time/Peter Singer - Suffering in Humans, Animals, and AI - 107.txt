Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Peter Singer professor of bioethics at Bristol University best known for his1975 book Animal Liberation that makes
 an ethical case against eating meat he has written brilliantly from anethical perspective on extreme poverty
 euthanasia human genetic selection sports doping the sale of kidneys andgenerally happiness including in his
 books ethics in the real world and the life you can save he was a keypopularizer of the effective altruism
 movement and is generally considered one of the most influential philosophers inthe world quick summary of the ads to

 my diet is made up of me I do not hunt the food I eat though one day I hope toI love fishing
 for example fishing and eating the fish I catch has always felt much more honestthan participating in the supply chain
 of factory farming from an ethics perspective this part of my life hasalways had a cloud over it
 it makes me think I've tried a few times in my life to reduce the amount of meatI eat but for some reason whatever the
 makeup of my body whatever the way I practice the dieting I have I get a lotof mental and physical energy and
 performance from eating meat so both intellectually and physically it's acontinued journey for me I returned to
 Peters work often to reevaluate the ethics of how I live this aspect of mylife let me also say that you may be a
 vegan or you may be a meat-eater it may be upset by the words I say or Petersays but I asked for this podcast

 and now here's my conversation with Peter Singeryou first become conscious of the fact
 that there is much suffering in the

0:05:30
Speaker 0 :world I think I was conscious of the
 fact that there's a lot of suffering the world pretty much as as soon as I wasable to understand anything about my
 family and its background because I lost three of my four grandparents in theHolocaust and obviously I knew why I
 only had one grandparent and she herself had been in the camps and survived so Ithink I knew a lot about that pretty
 early

0:05:57
Speaker 1 :my entire family comes from the Soviet
 Union I was born in so V and so sort of World War two has deep roots and aculture and the the suffering that the
 war brought the millions of people who died is in the is in the music is in theliterature's and the culture what do you
 think was the impact of the war broadly on our society the war had many impacts

0:06:24
Speaker 0 :I think one of them a beneficial impact
 is that it showed what racism and authoritarian government can do and atleast as far as the West was concerned I
 think that meant that I grew up in an era in which there wasn't the kind ofovert racism and anti-semitism that had
 existed for my parents in Europe I was growing up in Australia and certainlythat was clearly seen as something
 completely unacceptable there was also the fear of a furtheroutbreak of war which this time we
 expected would be nuclear because of the way the Second World War had ended sothere was this overshadowing of my
 childhood about the possibility that I would not live to grow up and be anadult because of catastrophic nuclear
 war there was a the film on the beach was made in which the city that I wasliving Melbourne was the last place on
 earth to have living human beings because of the nuclear cloud that wasspreading from the north so
 that certainly gave us a bit of that that sense there were many you knowthere were clearly many other legacies
 that we got of the war as well and the whole set up of the world and the thecold war that followed all of that has
 its roots in the Second World War you

0:07:54
Speaker 1 :know there is much beauty that comes
 from war sort of at a conversation with Eric Weinstein he said everything is isgreat about war except all the death and
 suffering do you think there's something positive that they came from the war thethe mirror that have put to our society
 sort of the ripple effects on it ethically speaking do you think there

0:08:22
Speaker 0 :are positive aspects to war I find it
 hard to see positive aspects in war and some of the things that other peoplethink of as as positive and beautiful
 maybe questioning so there's a certain kind of patriotism people say you knowduring wartime we all pull together we
 all work together against the common enemy and that's true an outside enemydoes unite a country and in general it's
 good for countries to be united and have common purposes but it also engenders akind of a nationalism and the patriotism
 that cannot be questioned and that I'm I'm more skeptical about what about the

0:09:01
Speaker 1 :the Brotherhood that people talk about
 from soldiers the the sort of counterintuitive sad idea that theclosest that people feel to each other
 is in those moments of suffering of being at the sort of the edge of seeingyour comrades dying in your arms that
 somehow brings people extremely closely together suffering brings people closertogether how do you make sense of that


0:09:30
Speaker 0 :it might bring people close together but
 there are other ways of bonding and being close to people I think withoutthe suffering and death that war entails


0:09:41
Speaker 1 :perhaps you could see you can already
 hear the romanticized Russian in me we tend to romanticize suffering just alittle bit in our literature and culture
 and so on could you take a step back and I apologize if it's a ridiculousquestion but what is suffering if you'll
 try to define what suffering is how

0:10:05
Speaker 0 :would you go about it suffering is a
 conscious state they can be neither suffering for a being who is completelyunconscious and it's distinguished from
 other conscious states in terms of being one that considered just in itself wewould rather be with that it's a
 conscious state that we want to stop if we're experiencing or we want to avoidhaving again if we've experienced it in
 the past and that's as I say emphasized for its own sake because of coursepeople will say well suffering
 strengthens the spirit it has good consequencesand sometimes it does have those
 consequences and of course sometimes we might undergo suffering we set ourselvesa challenge to run a marathon or climb a
 mountain or even just to go to the dentist so that the toothache doesn'tget worse
 even though we know the dentist is going to hurt us to some extent so I'm notsaying that we never choose suffering
 but I am saying that other things being equal we would rather not be in that

0:11:10
Speaker 1 :state of consciousness is the ultimate
 goal sort of you have the new ten year anniversary release the life you can saybook really influential book we'll talk
 about it a bunch of times throughout this conversation but do you think it'spossible to eradicate suffering errors
 at the goal or do we want to achieve a a kind of minimum threshold of sufferingand then keeping a little drop of poison
 that to keep things interesting in the

0:11:46
Speaker 0 :world in practice I don't think we ever
 will eliminate suffering so I think that little drop of poison as you put it orif you like that the contrast
 - of an unpleasant color perhaps something like that in a otherwiseharmonious and beautiful composition
 that is going to always be there if you ask me whether in theory if we could getrid of it I we should I think the answer
 is whether in fact we would be better off or whether in terms of byeliminating the suffering we would also
 eliminate some of the highs the positive hires and if that's so then we might beprepared to say it's worth having a
 minimum of suffering in order to have the best possible experiences as well is

0:12:33
Speaker 1 :there a relative aspect to suffering so
 we when you talk about eradicating poverty in the world is this the moreyou succeed the more the bar of what
 defines poverty raises or is there at the basic human ethical level a barthat's absolute that once you get above
 it then it we can morally converge to feeling like we have eradicated poverty

0:13:04
Speaker 0 :I think they're both and I think this is
 true for poverty as well as suffering there's an objective level of sufferingor of poverty where we're talking about
 objective indicators like you're constantly hungry you don't you can'tget enough food you're constantly cold
 you can't get warm you have some physical pains that you're never rid ofI think those things are objective but
 it may also be true that if you do get rid of that and you get to the stagewhere all of those basic needs have been
 met there may still be there new forms of suffering that develop and perhapsthat's what we're seeing in the affluent
 societies we have that people get bored for example they don't need to spend somany hours a day earning money to get
 enough to eat and shelter so now they're bored they like a sense of purpose thatcan happen
 and that then is a kind of a relative suffering that is distinct from theobjective forms of suffering but in your


0:14:14
Speaker 1 :focus on eradicating suffering you don't
 think about that kind of the the kind of interesting challenges and sufferingthat emerges in affluent societies
 that's just not in your ethical philosophical brain is that of interest

0:14:30
Speaker 0 :at all it would be of interest to me if
 we had eliminated all of the objective forms of suffering which I think of asgenerally more severe and also perhaps
 here at this stage anyway to know how to eliminate so yes in some future statewhen we've eliminated those objective
 forms of suffering I would be interested in trying to eliminate the relativeforms as well well that's not a
 practical need for me at the moment

0:14:59
Speaker 1 :sorry to linger on it because you kind
 of said it but just the is elimination the goal for the affluent society so isthere a crew you know do you see as
 suffering as a creative force suffering

0:15:14
Speaker 0 :can be a creative force
 I think repeating what I said about the highs and whether we need some of thelows to experience the highs so it may
 be that suffering makes us more creative and we regard that as worthwhile maybethat that brings some of those highs
 with it that we would not have had if we'd had no suffering I I don't reallyknow many people have suggested that and
 I certainly can't have no basis for denying itand if it's true then I would not want
 to eliminate suffering completely but

0:15:49
Speaker 1 :the focus is on and the absolute not to


0:15:55
Speaker 0 :be cold not to be hungry yes that's at
 the present stage of where the world's population is that's that's the focus

0:16:03
Speaker 1 :talking about human nature for a second
 do you think people are inherently good or do we all have good and evil in usthat basically everyone is capable of
 evil based on the environment certainly

0:16:16
Speaker 0 :most of us have
 potential for both good and evil I'm not prepared to say that everyone is capableof evil maybe some people who even in
 the worst of circumstances would not be capable of it but most of us are verysusceptible through environmental
 influences so when we look at things that we were talking about previouslylet's say the what the Nazis did during
 the Holocaust I think it's quite difficult to say I know that I would nothave done those things even if I were in
 the same circumstances as those who did them even if let's say I had grown upunder the Nazi regime and had been
 indoctrinated with racist ideas had also had the the idea that I must obey ordersfollow the commands of the Fuhrer plus
 of course perhaps the threat that if I didn't do certain things I might getsent to the Russian front and that would
 be a pretty grim fight I think it's really hard for anybody to saynevertheless I know I would not have
 killed those Jews or whatever so what's

0:17:27
Speaker 1 :your intuition how many people will be


0:17:31
Speaker 0 :able to say that truly to be able to say
 it I think very few less than 10% to me

0:17:37
Speaker 1 :it seems a very interesting and powerful
 thing to meditate on so I've read a lot about the war a world war 2 and I can'tescape the thought that I would have not


0:17:50
Speaker 0 :been one of the 10% right I have to say
 I simply don't know I would like to hope that I would have been one of the 10%but I don't really have any basis for
 claiming that I would have been different from the majority is it aworthwhile thing to contemplate it would
 be interesting if we could find a way of really finding these answers thereobviously is quite a bit of research on
 people during the Holocaust on how ordinary Germans got led to do terriblethings and there's what there are also
 studies of the resistance some heroic people in the white rose group forexample who resisted even though they
 knew they were likely to die for it but I don't know whether these studiesreally can answer your larger question
 of how many people would have been capable of doing that

0:18:47
Speaker 1 :well sort of the reason I think it's
 interesting is in the world as you described you know when when there arethings that you'd like to do they're
 good that are objectively good it's useful to think about whether I'm notwilling to do something or I don't even
 I'm not willing to acknowledge something as good and the right thing to dobecause I'm simply scared of putting my
 life of damaging my life in some kind of way and that kind of thought exercise ishelpful to understand what is what is
 the right thing in my current skill set and the capacity to do so if there'sthings that are convenient and there's I
 wonder if there are things that are highly inconvenient where I would haveto experience derision or hatred or or
 death or all those kinds of things but it's truly the right thing to do andthat kind of balance is I feel like in
 America we don't have it's it's difficult to think in the current timesit seems easier to put yourself back in
 history when you can sort of objectively contemplate whether how willing you areto do the right thing when the cost is


0:20:01
Speaker 0 :high true but I think we do face those
 challenges today and I think we can still ask ourselves those questions soone stand that I took more than 40 years
 ago now was to stop eating meat become a vegetarian at a time when you hardly metanybody who was a vegetarian or if you
 did they might have been a Hindu or they might have had some weird theories aboutmeat and health and I I know thinking
 about making that decision I was convinced that it was the right thing todo but I still did have to think how all
 my friends are going to think that I'm a crankbecause I'm now refusing to eat meat
 so you know I'm not saying there were any terrible sanctions obviously but Ithought about that and I guess I decided
 well I still think this is the right thing to do and if I'll put up with thatif it happens and one or two friends
 were clearly uncomfortable with that decision but you know that was prettyminor compared to the historical
 examples that we've been talking about but other issues that we have around toolike global poverty and what we ought to
 be doing about that is is another question where people I think can havehave the opportunity to take a stand on
 what's the right thing to do now climate change would be a third question whereagain people are taking a stand over you
 know look at great Atun Berg there and say well I think it must have taken alot of courage for a school girl to say
 I'm going to go on strike about climate change and see what happened yeah

0:21:39
Speaker 1 :especially in this divisive world she
 gets exceptionally huge amounts of support and hatred both there's a verydifficult for teenager to operate in in


0:21:51
Speaker 0 :

0:21:53
Speaker 1 :your book ethics in the real world
 amazing book people should check it out very easy read eighty two brief essayson things that matter one of the essays
 asks should robots have rights you've written about this so let me ask surerobots have rights if we ever develop


0:22:11
Speaker 0 :robots capable of consciousness capable
 of having their own internal perspective on what's happening to them so thattheir lives can go well or badly for
 them then robots should have rights

0:22:29
Speaker 1 :until that happens they shouldn't so its
 consciousness essentially a prerequisite to sufferingso everything that possesses
 consciousness is capable of suffering put another way and if so what is

0:22:47
Speaker 0 :consciousness I certainly think that
 consciousness is a prerequisite for suffering you can't suffer if you're notkind
 but is it true that every being is conscious will suffer or has to becapable of suffering I suppose you could
 imagine a kind of consciousness especially if we can construct it outofficially that's capable of
 experiencing pleasure but just automatically cuts out the consciousnesswhen when they're suffering sort of like
 you know instant anesthesia as soon as something is going to cause yousuffering
 so that's possible but doesn't exist as as far as we know on this planet yet ifyou asked what is consciousness
 philosophers often talk about it as their being a subject of experiences soyou and I and everybody listening to
 this is a subject of experience there is a conscious subject who is taking thingsin responding to it in various ways
 feeling good about it feeling bad about it and that's different from the kindsof artificial intelligence we have now I
 take out my phone I ask Google directions to where I'm goingGoogle gives me the directions and I
 choose to take a different way you know Google doesn't care it's not like I'moffending Google or anything like that
 there is no subjective experiences there and I think that's the indication thatGoogle day I we have now is is not
 conscious or at least that level of AI is not conscious and that's the way tothink about it now it may be difficult
 to tell of course whether a certain eye eye is or isn't conscious it may mimicconsciousness and we can't tell if it's
 only mimicking it or if it's the real thing but that's what we're looking foris there a subjective experience a
 perspective on the world from which things can go well or badly from that

0:24:49
Speaker 1 :perspective so our idea what Cocteau of
 what suffering looks like comes from our just watching our selves when we're in

0:25:00
Speaker 0 :pain sort of oh when we're experiencing


0:25:02
Speaker 1 :pleasure it's not only a pleasure and
 pain yes yes so and then you could actuallyback on us but I would say that's how we
 kind of build an intuition about animals is we can infer the similarities betweenhumans and animals and so infer that
 they're suffering or not based on certain things and they're conscious ornot so what if robots you mentioned
 Google Maps and I've done this experiment so I work in robotics justfrom my own self or I have several
 Roomba robots and I play with different speech interaction voice basedinteraction and if the Roomba or the
 robot or Google Maps shows any signs of pain like screaming or moaning or beingdispleased by something you've done that
 in my mind I can't help but immediately upgrade it and even when I myselfprogrammed it in just having another
 entity that's now for the moment disjoint from me showing signs of painmakes me feel like it is conscious like
 I immediately and then the whatever the I immediately realize it's not obviouslybut that feeling is there so sort of I
 guess I guess what do you think about a world where Google Maps and rope rumbasare pretending to be conscious and we
 descendants of apes are not smart enough to realize it or not or or whatever orthat is conscious they appear to be
 conscious and so you then have to give them rights the reason I'm asking thatis that kind of capability may be closer
 than then we realize yes that kind of

0:26:51
Speaker 0 :capability may be closer but I don't
 think it follows that we have to give them rightsI suppose the the argument for saying
 that in those circumstances we should give them rights is that if we don'twe'll harden ourselves against other
 beings who are not robots and who really do suffer that's a possibility that youknow if we get used to looking at a
 being suffering and saying man we don't have to doanything about that that being doesn't
 have any rights maybe we'll feel the same about animalsfor instance and interestingly among
 philosophers and thinkers who denied that we have any direct duties toanimals and this includes people like
 Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant they did say yes but still it's better not tobe cruel to them not because of the
 suffering we're inflicting on the animals but because if we are we maydevelop a cruel disposition and this
 will be bad for humans you know because we were more likely to be cruel to otherhumans and that would be wrong so but


0:28:05
Speaker 1 :you don't accept that kahin I don't


0:28:07
Speaker 0 :accept that as a the basis of the
 argument for why we shouldn't be cruel to animals I think the basis of theargument for why we shouldn't be cruel
 to animals is just that we're inflicting suffering on them and the suffering is abad thing but possibly I might accept
 some sort of parallel of that argument as a reason why you shouldn't be cruelto these robots that mimic the symptoms
 of pain if if it's gonna be harder for us to distinguish I would venture to say

0:28:33
Speaker 1 :I'd like to disagree with you and what
 most people I think at the risk of sounding crazy I would like to say thatif that Roomba is dedicated to faking
 the consciousness in the suffering I think we will it will be impossible forus
 I would I would like to apply the same arguments with animals to robots thatthey deserve rights in that sense now we
 might outlaw the addition of those kinds of features into rumors but once you doI think I'm quite surprised by the
 upgrade in consciousness that the display of suffering creates it's atotally open world but I'd like to just
 sort of the difference between animals and other humans is that in the robotcase we've added it in ourselves
 therefore we can say something about the how real it is but I would like tosay that the display of it is what makes
 it real and there's some I'm not a philosopher I'm not making that argumentbut at least like to add that as a
 possibility and I've been surprised by it is all I'm trying to sort ofinoculate poorly I suppose so there is a


0:29:55
Speaker 0 :philosophical view has been held about
 humans which is rather like what you're talking about and that's behaviorism sobehaviorism was employed both in
 psychology people like BF Skinner was a famous behavioristbut in psychology it was more a kind of
 a what is it that makes this science well you need to have behavior becausethat's what you can observe you can't
 observe consciousness but in philosophy the view defended by people like GilbertRyle who was a professor of philosophy
 at Oxford wrote a book called the concept of mind in which you know inthis kind of phase this is in the 40s of
 linguistic philosophy he said well the meaning of a term is its use and we useterms like so-and-so is in pain when we
 see somebody writhing or screaming or trying to escape some stimulus andthat's the meaning of the term so that's
 what it is to be in pain and you point to the behavior and Norman Malcolm whowas another philosopher in the school
 from Cornell had had the view that you know so what is it to dream after all wecan't see other people's dreams well
 when people wake up and say I just had a dream of you know here I was undressedwalking down the Main Street or whatever
 it is you've dreamt that's what it is to have a dream it's to basically to wakeup and recall something so you could
 apply this to to what you're talking aboutand say so what it is to be in pain is
 to exhibit these symptoms of pain behavior and therefore these robots arein pain that's what the word means but
 nowadays not many people think that riles kind of philosophical behaviorismis really very plausible so I think they
 would say the same about your view so

0:31:44
Speaker 1 :yes I'd just spoken with Noam Chomsky
 who basically was part of dismantling the behavioristbut and I'm with that 100% for studying
 human behavior but I am one of the few people in the world who has made Roombasscream in pain and I just don't know
 what to do with that empirical evidence because it's hard it's sort ofphilosophically I agree but the only
 reason I philosophically agree in that case is because that was the programmerbut if somebody else was a programmer
 I'm not sure I would be able to interpret that wall so it's uh I thinkit's a new world that I was just curious
 what your thoughts are for now you feel that the display of the what we can kindof intellectual say is a fake display of
 suffering is not suffering that's right

0:32:49
Speaker 0 :that would be my view but that's
 consistent of course with the idea that it's part of our nature to respond tothis display if it's reasonably
 authentically done and therefore it's understandable that people would feelthis and maybe as I said it's even a
 good thing that they do feel it and you wouldn't want to harden yourself againstit because then you might harden
 yourself against beings who are really

0:33:16
Speaker 1 :suffering but there's this line you know
 so you said once a artificial general intelligence system a human levelintelligence system become conscious I
 guess if I could just linger on it now I've wrote really dumb programs theyjust say things that I told them to say
 but how do you know when oh when a system like Alexa was just officiallycomplex you can introspect to how it
 works starts giving you signs of consciousnessthrough natural language that there's a
 there's a feeling there's another entity there that's self-aware that has a fearof death immortality but as awareness of
 itself that we kind of associate with other living creaturesit I guess I'm sort of trying to do the
 slippery slope from the very naive thing where I started into into somethingwhere it's sufficiently a black box to
 where it's starting to feel like it's conscious it wears that threshold or youwould start getting uncomfortable well
 the idea of robot suffering do you think

0:34:23
Speaker 0 :I don't know enough about the
 programming that we're going to this really to answer this question but Ipresume that somebody who does know more
 about this could could look at the program and see whether we can explainthe behaviors in a harmonious way that
 doesn't require us to suggest that some sort of consciousness has emerged oralternatively whether you're in a
 situation where you say I don't know how this is happening I the program doesgenerate a kind of artificial general
 intelligence which is autonomous you know starts to do things itself and isautonomous of the basic programming that
 set it up and so it's quite possible that actually we have achievedconsciousness in a system of artificial


0:35:18
Speaker 1 :intelligence sort of the the approach to
 that worker that most of the community is really excited about now is withlearning methods so machine learning and
 the learning methods are unfortunately are not capable of revealing which iswhy somebody like Noam Chomsky
 criticizes them you've created our philosophy the science of how it worksand so it's possible if those are the
 kinds of methods that succeed we won't be able to know exactly sort of try toreduce try to find whether there is this
 thing is conscious or not this thing is IntelliJ or not it's simply giving whenwe talk to it it displays wit and humor
 and cleverness and emotion and fear and then we won't be able to say we're inthe billions of nodes new
 in this artificial neural network is is the fear coming from sort of in thatcase that's a really interesting place
 where we do now start to return to behaviorism and say yeah that's that's

0:36:27
Speaker 0 :there isn't an interesting issue I would
 say that if we have serious doubts and think it might be conscious then weought to try to give it the benefit of
 the doubt just as I would say with animals we I think we can be highlyconfident that vertebrates are conscious
 but when we get that and and some invertebrates like the octopus but butwith insects it's much harder to be to
 be confident of that I think we should give them the benefit of the doubt wherewe can which means you know I think
 would be wrong to torture an insect but this doesn't necessarily mean it's wrongto slap a mosquito that's about to bite
 you and stop you getting to sleep so I think you you try to achieve somebalance in these circumstances of


0:37:22
Speaker 1 :uncertainty if it's okay with you if we
 can go back just briefly so forty four years ago like you mentioned forty plusyears ago you've heard an animal
 liberation the classic book that started that launched was a foundation of themovement of animal liberation deep can
 you summarize the key set of ideas that

0:37:44
Speaker 0 :underpin netbook certainly the the key
 idea that underlies that book is the concept of speciesism which i did notinvent that term I took it from a man
 called Richard Ryder who was in Oxford when I was and I saw a pamphlet thathe'd written about experiments on
 chimpanzees that used that term but I think I contributed to making itphilosophically more precise and to
 getting it into a broader audience and the idea is that we have a bias or aprejudice against taking seriously the
 interests of beings who are not members of our species just as in the pastEuropeans for example had a bias against
 taking Syria the interests of Africans racism and menhave had a bias against taking seriously
 the interests of women sexism so I think something analogous not completelyidentical but something analogous goes
 on and has gone on for a very long time with the way humans see themselvesvisibly animals we see ourselves as more
 important we see animals as existing to serve our needs in various ways and youcan find this very explicit in earlier
 philosophers from Aristotle through the Kant others and either we don't need totake their interests into account at all
 or we can discount it because they're not humans they can a little bit butthey don't count nearly as much as
 humans do my book I use that that attitude is responsible for a lot of thethings that we do to animals that are
 wrong confining them indoors in very crowded cramped conditions in factoryfarms to produce meat or eggs or milk
 more cheaply using them in some research that's by no means essential forsurvival or well-being and a whole lot
 you know some of the sports and things that we do to animalsso I think that's unjustified because I
 think the significance of pain and suffering does not depend on the speciesof the being who is in pain or suffering
 any more than it depends on the race or sex with the being who is in pain orsuffering and I think we ought to
 rethink our treatment of animals along the lines of saying if the pain is justas great in animal and it's just as bad
 that it happens as if it were a human

0:40:24
Speaker 1 :maybe if I could ask
 I apologize hopefully it's not a ridiculous question but so as far as weknow we cannot communicate with animals
 to a natural language but we would be able to communicate with robots so I'mreturning just of a small parallel
 between perhaps animals in the future of AI if we do create nature a system or aswe approach creating that age a system
 what kind of questions would you ask her to try to to try to intuit whetherwhether there is consciousness whether
 or more importantly whether there's

0:41:10
Speaker 0 :capacity to suffer I might ask the AGI
 what she was feeling well does she have feelings and if shesays yes to describe those feelings to
 describe what they were like to see what the phenomenal account of consciousnessis like that's one question I might also
 try to find out if the AGI has a sense of itself so for example the idea wouldyou you know we often ask people so
 suppose you're in a car accident and your brain were transplanted intosomeone else's body do you think you
 would survive or would it be the person whose body was still survivingyou know your body having been destroyed
 and most people say I think I would you know if my brain was transplanted alongwith my memories and so on I would
 survive so we could ask Adi those kinds of questions if they were transferred toa different piece of hardware would they
 survive what would survive that effect

0:42:15
Speaker 1 :so it's sort of on that line another
 perhaps absurd question but do you think having a body is necessary forconsciousness so do you think digital
 beings can suffer presumably digital

0:42:30
Speaker 0 :beings need to be running on some kind


0:42:36
Speaker 1 :of hardware right yes it ultimately
 boils down to but this is exactly we just said is moving the brain right one

0:42:42
Speaker 0 :place so you couldn't move it to a
 different kind of highway you know and I could say look you know your hardware isneeds getting worn out we're going to
 transfer you to a fresh piece of hardware so we kind ofshut you down for a time but don't worry
 you know you'll be running very soon on a nice fresh piece of hardware and youcould imagine this conscious AG are
 saying that's fine I don't mind having a little rest just make sure you don'tlose me like that yeah I mean that's an


0:43:08
Speaker 1 :interesting thought that even with us
 humans the suffering is in the software we right now don't know how to repairthe hardware yeah but we're learning
 we're getting better at it and better and the idea I mean a lot of some peopledream about one day being able to
 transfer certain aspects of the software to another piece of hardware what do youthink just on that topic there's been a
 lot of exciting innovation in brain computer interfaces I don't know ifyou're familiar with the companies like
 neural link with Elon Musk communicating both ways from a computer being able tosend activate neurons and being able to
 read spikes from neurons with it with the dream of being able to expand sortof increase the bandwidth of which your
 brain can like look up articles on Wikipedia I don't think expanding keptin the knowledge capacity of the brain
 do you think that notion is is that interesting to you as the expansion ofthe human mind yes that's very


0:44:15
Speaker 0 :interesting
 I'd love to be able to have that increased bandwidth and I you know if Iwant better access to my memory I have
 to say to is yet older you know you I talked to my wife about things that wedid 20 years ago or something her memory
 is often better about particular events where were we who was at that event whatdid he or she where even she may know
 and I have not the faintest idea about this but perhaps it's somewhere in mymemory and if I had at this extended
 memory I could I could search that particular year and rerun those things Ithink that would be great in some sense


0:44:48
Speaker 1 :we already have that by storing so much
 of our data online like pictures of

0:44:54
Speaker 0 :different yes well Gmail is fantastic
 for that because you know people people email me as if they know me well yeah Ihaven't got a clue who they are but then
 I search for their name email me in 2007 and I know who they are now yeah so we

0:45:06
Speaker 1 :already do it taking the first steps
 already so on the flip side of AI people x2 Russell and others focus on thecontrol problem value alignment in AI
 which is the problem of making sure we build systems that align to our ownvalues or ethics do you think sort of
 high level how do we go about building systems do you think is it possible thatalign with our values align with our
 human ethics or living being ethics

0:45:39
Speaker 0 :presumably it's it's possible to do that
 I know that lot of people who think that there's a real danger that we won't thatwill more or less accidentally lose
 control of of AGI yeah laughs hear

0:45:52
Speaker 1 :

0:45:53
Speaker 0 :yourself personally I'm not quite sure
 what to think I talk to philosophers like Nick Bostrom and Toby Ord and theythink that this is a real problem where
 you need to worry about then I talk to people who work for Microsoft ordeepmind or somebody and I say no we're
 not really that close to producing a gr you know super intelligence so if you

0:46:19
Speaker 1 :look at Nick Bostrom's of the arguments
 it's very hard to defend some of course and I myself engineer I a system so I'mmore with the deep mind folks were it
 seems that we're really far away but then the counter-argument is is thereany fundamental reasonable that we'll
 never achieve it and if not and eventually there will be a direexistential risk so we should be
 concerned about it and do you have give define that argument at all appealing inthis domain or any domain that
 eventually this will be a problem so we should be worried about it yes I think

0:46:56
Speaker 0 :it's a problem I think there's that's a
 valid point of course when you say eventually that raises the question howfar off is that and is there something
 that we can do about it now because if we're talking about this is going to bea hundred years in the future
 and you consider how rapid our knowledge of artificial intelligencehas grown in the last 10 or 20 years it
 seems unlikely that there's anything much we could do now that wouldinfluence whether this is going to
 happen a hundred years in the future you know people in 80 years in the futurewould be in a much better position to
 say this is what we need to do to prevent this happening then than we arenow
 so to some extent I find that reassuring but I'm all in favor of some peopledoing research into this to see if
 indeed it is that far off or if we are in a position to do something about itsooner I'm I'm very much of the view
 that extinction is a terrible thing and therefore even if the risk of extinctionis very small if we can reduce that risk
 that's something that we ought to do my disagreement with some of these peoplewho talk about long term risks
 extinction risks is only about how much priority that should have is compared to

0:48:20
Speaker 1 :present questions no such it if you look
 at the math of it from a utilitarian perspective if it's existential risk soeverybody dies that there's a it feels
 like an infinity in the math equation that if that makes the math where thepriority is difficult to do that if we
 don't know the time scale and you can legitimately argue this nonzeroprobability that all happened tomorrow
 that how do you deal with these kinds of existential risks like from nuclear warfrom nuclear weapons from biological
 weapons from I'm not sure if global warming falls into that category becauseglobal warming is a lot more gradual


0:49:04
Speaker 0 :mm-hmm and people say it's not an
 existential risk because they'll always be possibilities of some humans existingfarming Antarctica or wrestles in
 Siberia or something of that sort yeah

0:49:14
Speaker 1 :but you don't find this of did did
 complete existential risks a fundamental like an overriding part of the equations

0:49:24
Speaker 0 :of ethics I wouldn't know you know
 certainly if you treated as an infinity then it plays havoc with anycalculations
 arguably we shouldn't only one of the ethical assumptions that goes into thisis that the loss of future lives that is
 of merely possible lives of beings who may never exist at all is in some waycomparable to the sufferings or deaths
 of people who who do exist at some point and that's not clear to me I thinkthere's a case for saying that but I
 also think there's a case for taking the other view so that has some impact on itof course you might say ah yes but still
 if there's some uncertainty about this and the the costs of extinction areinfinite then still it's gonna overwhelm
 and everything else but I suppose I I'm not convinced of that I'm not convincedthat it's really infinite here and even
 Nick Bostrom in his discussion of this doesn't claim that there'll be aninfinite number of lives live is he and
 what is a 10 to the 56th or something it's a vast number that I think hecalculates this is assuming we can
 upload consciousness onto these you know Dilek on digital form did digital formsand therefore there'll be much more
 energy efficient but he calculates the amount of energy in the universe orsomething like that so then I was a vast
 but not infinite which gives you some prospect maybe of resisting some of the

0:50:55
Speaker 1 :argument the the beautiful thing with
 Nick's arguments is he quickly jumps from the individual scale to theuniversal scale which is just
 awe-inspiring to think right when you think about the entirety of the span oftime of the universe it's both
 interesting from a computer science perspective AI perspective and from anethical perspective the idea of
 utilitarianism because you say what is

0:51:18
Speaker 0 :utilitarianism utilitarianism is the
 ethical view that the right thing to do is the act that has the greatestexpected utility where what that means
 is it's the act that will produce the best consequences discounted by the oddsthat you won't be able to produce those
 consequences that something will go wrong but in simple case let's assume wewe have certainty about what the
 consequences of our actions will be then the right action is the action thatwill produce the best consequences is


0:51:49
Speaker 1 :that always and by the way there's a
 bunch of nuanced stuff the talk with Sam Harris on this podcast on the peopleshould go listen to it's great to think
 two hours of moral philosophy discussion but is that an easy calculation no it's

0:52:05
Speaker 0 :a difficult calculation and actually
 there's one thing that I need to add and that is utilitarians certainly theclassical utilitarians think that by
 best consequences we're talking about happiness and the absence of pain andsuffering there are other
 consequentialists who are not really utilitarians who say there are differentthings that could be good consequences
 justice freedom you know human dignity knowledge they all kind as goodconsequences too and that makes the
 calculations even more difficult because then you need to know how to balancethese things off if you are just talking
 about well-being using that term to express happiness and the absence ofsuffering I think that the calculation
 becomes more manageable in a philosophical sense it's still inpractice we don't know how to do it we
 don't know how to measure quantities of happiness and misery we don't know howto calculate the probabilities that
 different actions will produce this or that so at best we can use it as a as arough guide to different actions and one
 way we have to focus on the short-term consequences because we just can'treally predict all of the longer-term
 ramifications

0:53:24
Speaker 1 :so what about the sort of what about
 this the extreme suffering of very small groups sort of utilitarianism is focusedon the overall aggregate right how do
 you would you say you yourself a utilitarian you'll find that sort of doyou what do you make of the difficult
 ethical maybe poetic suffering of very few individuals I think it's possible

0:53:54
Speaker 0 :that that gets overwritten by benefits
 to very large numbers of India I think that can can be the right answerbut before we conclude that is the right
 us that we have to know how severe the suffering is and how that compares withthe benefits so I I tend to think that
 extreme suffering is worse than always further if you like below the neutrallevel then extreme happiness or bliss is
 above it so when I think about the worst experience as possible and the bestexperience as possible I don't think of
 them as equidistant from neutral so like it's a scale that goes from minus 100through zero as a neutral level to plus
 a hundred because I know that I would not exchange an hour of my mostpleasurable experiences for an hour of
 my most painful experiences even I wouldn't have an hour of my most painfulexperiences even for two hours or ten
 hours of my most painful experiences did

0:55:03
Speaker 1 :I say that correctly yeah maybe 20 hours
 then yeah well one what's the exchange

0:55:06
Speaker 0 :rate oh that's the question what is the
 exchange rate but I think it's it can be quite high so that's why you shouldn'tjust assume that you know it's okay to
 make one person suffer extremely in order to make two people much better offit might be a much larger number but at
 some point I do think you should aggregate and and the result will beeven though it violates our intuitions
 of justice and fairness whatever it might be giving priority to those whoare worse off at some point I still
 think that will be the right thing to do

0:55:43
Speaker 1 :yes I'm complicated nonlinear function
 and ask the sort of out there question is the more remote put our data outthere the more we're able to measure a
 bunch of factors of each of our individual human lives and I guessforesee the ability to estimate
 well-being of without whatever we public we together collectively agree and agood object function for from a
 utilitarian perspective do you think it do you think it'll be possible and is agood idea to
 push that kind of analysis to make then public decisions perhaps with the helpof AI that you know here's a tax rate
 here's a tax rate at which well-being will be optimized and yeah that would be

0:56:28
Speaker 0 :great if we could if we really knew that
 if we could really could calculate that

0:56:31
Speaker 1 :nobody do you think it's possible to
 converge towards an agreement amongst humans but towards an objective functionis just a hopeless pursuit I don't think


0:56:41
Speaker 0 :it's hopeless I think it's difficult be
 difficult to get converged towards agreement at least at present becausesome people would say you know I've got
 different views about justice and I think you ought to give priority tothose who are worse off even though I
 acknowledge that the gains that the worst offer making our less than thegains that those who are sort of medium
 badly off could be making so we still have all of these intuitions that we weargue about so I don't think we would
 get agreement but the fact that we wouldn't get agreement doesn't show thatthere isn't a right answer there do you


0:57:17
Speaker 1 :think who gets to say what is right and
 wrong do you think there's place for Ethics oversight from from thegovernment so I'm thinking in the case
 of AI overseeing what is what kind of decisions they I can't make and not butalso if you look at animal animal rights
 or rather not rights or perhaps rights but the idea is you've explored in anAnimal Liberation who gets to so you
 eloquently beautifully write in your book that this will here you know weshouldn't do this but is there some
 harder rules that should be imposed or is this a collective thing wouldconverge towards a society and thereby
 make the better and better ethical

0:58:00
Speaker 0 :decisions politically I'm still a
 Democrat despite looking at the flaws in democracy and why it doesn't workalways very well so I don't see a better
 option than allowing the public to vote for governments in accordance with theirpolicies and I hope that they will vote
 for policies policies that reduce the suffering of animals andreduce the suffering of distant humans
 whether geographically distant or distant because their future humans butI recognize that democracy isn't really
 well set up to do that and in a sense you could imagine a wise and benevolentyou know omni-benevolent leader who
 would do that better than democracies could but in the world in which we liveit's difficult to imagine that this
 leader isn't going to be corrupted by a variety of influences you know we'vewe've had so many examples of people
 who've taken power with good intentions and then have ended up being corrupt andfavoring themselves so I don't know if
 you know that's why as I say I don't know that we have a better system thandemocracy to make this decision well so


0:59:20
Speaker 1 :you also discuss effective altruism
 which is a mechanism for going around government for putting the power in thehands of the people to donate money
 towards causes to help you know do you know did remove the middleman and giveit directly to the to the causes they
 care about sort of maybe this is a good time to ask you 10 years ago wrote lifeyou can save that's now I think
 available for free online that's right

0:59:51
Speaker 0 :you can download either the ebook or the
 audiobook free from the life you can

0:59:57
Speaker 1 :saved org and what are the key ideas the
 present in in the book the main thing I

1:00:03
Speaker 0 :want to do in the book is to make people
 realize that it's not difficult to help people in extreme poverty that there arehighly effective organizations now but
 doing this that they've been independently assessed and verified byresearch teams that are expert in this
 area and that it's a fulfilling thing to do to for at least part of your life youknow we can't all be Saints but at least
 one of your goals should be to really make a positive contribution to theworld and to do something to help people
 who through no fault of their own are in very direcircumstances and and living a life that
 is barely or perhaps not at all a decent life for a human being to live so you

1:00:51
Speaker 1 :described a minimum ethical standard of
 giving what what advice would you give to people that want to be effectivelyaltruistic in their life like live an
 effective altruism life there are many

1:01:08
Speaker 0 :different kinds of ways of living as an
 effective altruists and if you're at the point where you're thinking about yourlong term career I'd recommend you take
 a look at a website called 80,000 hours 80,000 hours org which looks at ethicalcareer choices and they range from for
 example going to work on Wall Street so that you can earn a huge amount of moneyand then donate most of it to effective
 charities to going to work for a really good nonprofit organization so that youcan directly use your skills and ability
 and hard work to further a good cause or perhaps going into politics may be smallchances but because I off sin in
 politics go to work in the public service where if you're talented youmight rise to a higher level where you
 can influence decisions do research in an area where the payoff could be greatthere are a lot of different
 opportunities but too few people are even thinking about those questionsthey're just going along in some sort of
 preordained rut to particular careers maybe they think they land a lot ofmoney and have a comfortable life but
 they may not find that as fulfilling as actually knowing that they're making apositive difference to the world what


1:02:25
Speaker 1 :about in terms of so that's like
 long-term $80,000 sure a shorter term giving part of well actually it's a partof that and go to Walker work at Wall
 Street if you would like to give a percentage of your income you talk aboutlife you can save that I mean is it I
 was looking through it's quite a compelling it's I mean I'm just a dumbengineer so I like there's simple


1:02:52
Speaker 0 :rulz okay so I do actually set out
 suggested levels of giving because people often ask me about this a popularanswer is give 10% the traditional tithe
 that's recommended in Christianity and also Judaism but you know why should itbe the same percentage irrespective of
 your income tax scales reflect the idea that the more income you have the moreyou can pay tax and I think the same is
 true in what you can give so I I do set out a progressive donor scale whichstarts out at 1% for people on modest
 incomes and rises to 33 and a third percent for people who are reallyearning a lot and my idea is that I
 don't think any of these amounts really impose real hardship on on peoplebecause they are progressive and geared
 to income so I think anybody can do this and can know that they're doingsomething significant to play their part
 in reducing the huge gap between people in extreme poverty in the world andpeople living effluent lives and aside


1:04:02
Speaker 1 :from it being an ethical life it's 1
 Nephi more fulfilling because like there's something about our human naturethat or some of our human nature's maybe
 most of our human nature that enjoys doing the the ethical thing yes I make

1:04:21
Speaker 0 :both those arguments that it it is an
 ethical requirement and like kind of world we live in today to help people ingreat need when we can easily do so but
 also that it is a rewarding thing and there's good psychological researchshowing that people who give more tend
 to be more satisfied with their lives and I think this has something to dowith with having a purpose that's larger
 than yourself and therefore never being if you like never never being boredsitting around oh you know what will I
 do next I've got nothing to do in a world like this there are many goodthings that you can do and enjoy doing
 them plus you're working with other people in the effective altruismmovement
 forming a community of other people with similar ideas and they tend to beinteresting thoughtful and good people
 as well and having friends of that sort is another big contribution to having a

1:05:16
Speaker 1 :good life so we talked about big things
 that are beyond ourselves but we where we're also just human and mortal do youponder your own mortality is there
 insights about your philosophy the ethics that you gain from pondering yourown mortality clearly you know as you


1:05:35
Speaker 0 :get into your 70s you can't help
 thinking about your own mortality but I don't know that I have great insightsinto that from my philosophy I don't
 think there's anything after the death of my bodyassuming that we won't be able to upload
 my mind into anything at the time when I die so I don't think there's anyafterlife or anything to look forward to
 in that sense we fear death so if you

1:06:01
Speaker 1 :look at Ernest Becker and describing the
 motivating aspects of the our ability to be cognizant of our mortality do youhave any of those elements in your
 driving your motivation life I suppose

1:06:21
Speaker 0 :the fact that you have only a limited
 time to achieve the things that you want to achieve gives you some sort ofmotivation to get going and achieving
 them and if we thought very mortal we might say you know I can put that offfor another decade or two so there's
 that about it but otherwise you know no I'd rather have more time to do more I'dalso like to be able to see how things
 go that I'm interested in you know his climate change gonna turn out to be asdire as a lot of scientists say that it
 is is going to be will we somehow scrape through with less damage than we thoughtI'd really like to know the answers to
 those questions but I guess I'm not

1:07:02
Speaker 1 :going to well you said there's nothing
 afterwards so let me ask the even more absurd question what do you think is themeaning of it all I think the meaning of


1:07:10
Speaker 0 :life is the meaning we give to it I
 don't think that we were brought into the universefor any kind of larger purpose but given
 that we exist I think we can recognize that some things are objectively badextreme suffering is an example and
 other things are objectively good like having a rich fulfilling enjoyablepleasurable life and we can try to do
 our part in reducing the bad things and

1:07:46
Speaker 1 :increasingly good things so one way the
 meaning is to do a little bit more of the good things objectively good thingsand a little bit less of the bad things


1:07:55
Speaker 0 :yes or do as much of the good things as
 you can and there's little of the bad

1:08:00
Speaker 1 :things either beautifully put I don't
 think there's a better place to end it thank you so much for talking today
