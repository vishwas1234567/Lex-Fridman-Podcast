Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 michael i jordan a professor at berkeley and oneof the most
 influential people in the history of machine learning statisticsand artificial intelligence he has been
 cited over 170 thousand times and has mentored many of the world-classresearchers defining the field
 of ai today including andrew eng zubin garamani bentascar and

0:00:26
Speaker 0 :yoshio banjo all this


0:00:26
Speaker 1 :to me is as impressive as the over 32
 000 points and the six nba championships of the michaelj jordan of basketball fame
 there's a non-zero probability that i talked to the other michael jordangiven my connection to and love the
 chicago bulls of the 90s but if i had to pick one i'm going withthe michael jordan
 of statistics and computer science or as john le calls himthe miles davis of machine learning
 in his blog post titled artificial intelligence the revolution hasn'thappened yet
 michael argues for broadening the scope or the artificial intelligence fieldin many ways the underlying spirit of
 this podcast is the same to see artificialintelligence
 as a deeply human endeavor to not only engineeralgorithms and robots but to understand
 and empower human beings at all levels of abstractions from theindividual
 to our civilization as a whole this is the artificial intelligence podcastif you enjoy it
 subscribe on youtube give it five stars at apple podcastsupport it on patreon or simply connect
 with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled fridayas usual i'll do one or two minutes of
 ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of theconversation
 i hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience

Speaker 1 :this show is presented by cash app the
 number one finance app in the app store

0:01:59
Speaker 0 :when you get it use code lex podcast


0:02:00
Speaker 1 :cash app unless you send money to
 friends buy bitcoin and invest in the stock market with aslittle as one dollar
 since cash app does fractional share trading let me mentionthat the order execution algorithm that
 works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of thefractional orders
 is to me an algorithmic marvel so big props for the cash app engineersfor solving a hard problem that in the
 end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layerof abstraction over the stock market
 making trading more accessible for new investorsand diversification much easier
 so once again if you get cash app from the app store or google playand use the code lex podcast you'll get
 ten dollars and cash app will also donate tendollars the first one of my favorite
 organizations that is helping to advance robotics and stem education for youngpeople


0:02:55
Speaker 0 :

0:02:56
Speaker 1 :around the world and now here's my
 conversation

0:03:00
Speaker 0 :with michael i jordan


0:03:01
Speaker 1 :given that you're one of the greats in
 the field of ai machine learning computer science and so onyou're trivially called the michael
 jordan of machine learning although as you know you were bornfirst so technically mj is the michael i
 jordan of basketball but anyway my my favorite is yan lacalling you the miles davis
 of machine learning because as he says you reinvent yourself periodically andsometimes leave
 fans scratching their heads after you change direction socan you put at first your historian hat
 on and give a history of computer scienceand ai as you saw it
 as you experienced it including the four generations of ai successes

0:03:47
Speaker 0 :that i've seen you talk about
 sure yeah first of all i much prefer yon'smetaphor um miles davis is uh was
 a real explorer in jazz and um he had a coherent story so i think i have one andbut it's not just the one you live
 it's the one you think about later what a good historian does is theylook back and they revisit um i think
 what happening right now is not ai that was an intellectualaspiration
 um that's still alive today is an aspirationbut i think this is akin to the
 development of chemical engineering from chemistry or electrical engineeringfrom from electromagnetism
 so if you go back to the 30s or 40s there wasn't yet chemical engineeringthere was chemistry there was fluid flow
 there was mechanics and so on but peoplepretty clearly viewed interesting goals
 try to build factories that you make chemicals products and do itviably safely
 make good ones do it at scale so people started to try to do that ofcourse and some factories worked some
 didn't you know some were not viable someexploded but in parallel
 developed a whole field called chemical engineering right and chemicalengineering is a field it's it's no
 no bones about it it has theoretical aspects to it it haspractical aspects it's not just
 engineering quote unquote it's the real thing real concepts are neededsame thing with
 electrical engineering you know there was maxwell's equations which in somesense
 were everything you know about electromagnetism but you needed tofigure out how to build circuits how to
 build modules how to put them together how to bring electricity from one pointto another
 safely and so on so forth so whole field is developed called electricalengineering
 all right i think that's what's happening right now is that we have wehave a proto
 field which is statistics compute more the theoretical side of the algorithmicside of computer science
 that was enough to start to build things but what things systemsthat bring value to human beings and use
 human data and mix in human decisions the engineering side of that is all adhoc
 that's what's emerging in fact if you want to call machine learning a fieldi think that's what it is that's a proto
 form of engineering based on statistical and computational ideas of previous

0:05:55
Speaker 1 :generations
 but do you think there's something deeper about ai in his dreams andaspirations
 as compared to chemical engineering and

0:06:02
Speaker 0 :electrical engineering well the dreams
 and aspirations maybe but those are from those are500 years from now i think that that's
 like the greek sitting there and saying it would be neat to get to the moonsomeday
 right um i hate we have no clue how the brain does computation uh we're just aclueless we're like we're even worse
 than the greeks almost anything interesting uhscientifically of our era


0:06:23
Speaker 1 :can you linger on that just for a moment
 because you stand not completely unique but a little bitunique in that in the clarity of that
 can you can you elaborate your intuition ofwhy we like where we stand in our
 understanding of the human brain and a lot of people say you knowscientists say we're not very far in
 understanding human brain but you're like you're saying we're in

0:06:43
Speaker 0 :the dark here well i know i'm not unique
 i don't even think in the clarity but if you talk to real neuroscientists thatreally study real
 synapses or real neurons they agree they agree it's a hundred year hundreds ofyear
 tasks and they're building it up slowly surelywhat the signal is there is not clear we
 think we have all of our metaphors we think it's electrical maybe it'schemical it's a whole soup
 it's ions and proteins and it's a cell and that's even around like a singlesynapse if you look at a
 electromicrograph of a single synapse it's a it's a city of its ownand that's one little thing on a
 dendritic tree which is extremely complicated you know electrochemicalthing
 and it's doing these spikes and voltages have been flying around and thenproteins are taking that and
 taking it down into the dna and who knows what so it is theproblem of the next few centuries it is
 fantastic but we have our metaphors about it is it an economic device is itlike the immune system or is it like a
 layered you know set of copy you know arithmeticcomputations what
 we have all these metaphors and they're fun but that's notreal science per se there is
 neuroscience that's not neuroscience all right that that's that's like thegreek speculating about how to get to
 the moon fun right and i think that i like to saythis fairly strongly because i think a
 lot of young people think we're on the vergebecause a lot of people who don't talk
 about it clearly let it be understood that yes we kind of this isbrain inspired we're kind of
 close you know breakthroughs are on the horizonand unscrupulous people sometimes who
 need money for their labs um as i'm saying scrupulous but peoplewill oversell um i need money from a lab
 i'm gonna i'm studying here you know computationalneuroscience
 um i'm gonna oversell it and so there's been too much of that

0:08:25
Speaker 1 :so i'll step into the slight the gray
 area between metaphor and engineering with uh i'm not sure if you're familiarwith
 brain computer interfaces so a company like elon musk has neural linkthat's working on putting electrodes
 into the brain and trying to be able to read both readand send electrical signals just as you
 said even the basic mechanism ofcommunication
 in the brain is not something we understand butdo you hope without understanding the
 fundamental principles of how the brain workswe'll be able to do something
 interesting at that gray area of metaphor it's not

0:09:06
Speaker 0 :my area so i i hope
 in the sense like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen fromresearch
 i would expect more something like alzheimer's will get figured out frommodern neuroscience that you know a lot
 of there's a lot of human suffering based on brain diseaseand we throw things like lithium at the
 brain it kind of works no one has a clue whythat's not quite true but you know
 mostly we don't know and that's even just about the biochemistry of the brainand how it leads to mood swings and so
 on how thought emerges from that we just we were really really completelydim
 so that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signalprocessing on that and try to find
 patterns fine you know by all means go for itit's just not scientific at this point
 it's just it's so it's like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching theemissions
 from a city and trying to affirm things about the micro economy even though youdon't have microeconomic concepts
 i mean it's really that kind of thing and so yes can you find some signalsthat do something interesting or useful
 can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain yeah absolutely you knowand then
 i can imagine business models based on that and evenyou know medical applications of that
 but from there to understanding algorithms that allow us toreally tie in deeply to from the brain
 to computer you know i just no i don't agree with elon musk i don't thinkthat's even that's not for our
 generation it's not even for the century

0:10:26
Speaker 1 :so just uh in hopes of getting you to
 dream uh you've mentioned kolmogorov andtouring might pop
 up do you think that there might be breakthroughsthey'll get you to sit back in five ten
 years and say

0:10:42
Speaker 0 :wow oh i'm sure there will be but i
 don't think that there'll be demos that impress mei don't think that having a computer
 call a restaurant and pretend to be a humanis a breakthrough and people you know
 some people present it as such it's imitating human intelligence it'seven putting coughs
 in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt and sofine the world runs on those things too
 and i don't want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that goesbehind things like that and
 and the ultimate value to the human race but that's not scientific understandingand and i know the people who work on
 these things they are after a scientific understandingyou know in the meantime they've got to
 kind of you know the trains got to run and they got miles to feed and they gotthings to do
 and there's nothing wrong with all that i would call that though justengineering and i want to distinguish
 that between an engineering field like electoral internet chemical injury thatoriginally that originally
 emerged that had real principles and you really knew what you're doing and youhad a little scientific understanding
 maybe not even complete so it became more predictable and it wasreally gave value to human life because
 it was understood and and so we have to we don't want tomuddle too much these waters of
 you know what we're able to do versus what we really can do in a way that'sgoing to impress the next
 so i don't i don't need to be wowed but i i think that someone comes along in 20years
 a younger person who's absorbed all the uhthe technology and for them to be wowed
 i think they have to be more deeply impressed a young kulmogorov would notbe wowed by some of the stunts that you
 see right now coming from the big

0:12:13
Speaker 1 :companies the demos but do you think the
 breakthroughs from kolmogorov would be and give this question a chancedo you think they'll be in the
 scientific fundamental principles arena or do youthink it's possible to have fundamental
 breakthroughs in engineering meaning you know i would say some of thethings that elon musk is working with
 spacex and then others sort of trying torevolutionize the fundamentals of
 engineering of manufacturing of of saying here's a problem we know howto do a demo of and actually taking it


0:12:43
Speaker 0 :to scale
 yeah so so there's going to be all kinds of breakthroughs i just don't like thatterminology i'm a scientist and i work
 on things day in and day out and things move along and eventuallysay wow something happened but it's i
 don't like that language very much also i don't like to prize theoreticalbreakthroughs over practical ones
 um i tend to be more of a theoretician and i think there's lots to do in thatarena right now um and so i wouldn't
 point to the komo gurus i might point to the edisons of the era and maybe musk isa bit more like that
 but um you know musk god bless him also we'll say things about ai that he knowsvery little about
 and and he doesn't know what he's he he is you know leads people astray when hetalks about things he doesn't know
 anything about trying to program a computer tounderstand natural language to be
 involved in a dialogue we're having right now that can happenin our lifetime you could fake it
 you can mimic sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread themwith the deep understanding of language
 now it's not going to happen and so from thatyou know i hope you can perceive that
 the deeper yet deeper kind of aspects and intelligence are not going to happennow will there be breakthroughs you know
 i think that google was a breakthrough i think amazon's abreakthrough you know i think uber is a
 breakthrough you know that bring value to human beings at scale innew brand new ways based on data flows
 and and so on a lot of these things are slightlybroken because there's not a kind of a
 engineering field that takes economic value in context of dataand and at you know planetary scale and
 and worries about all the externalities the privacy youknow we don't have that field so we
 don't think these things through very wellbut i see that is emerging and that will
 be cons that will you know looking back from 100 years that will be constituteda breakthrough in this era just like
 electrical engineering was a breakthrough in the early part of thelast century and chemical injury was a
 breakthrough

0:14:24
Speaker 1 :so the scale the markets that you talk
 about and we'll get to will be seen as sort of breakthrough andwe're in the very early days of really
 doing interesting stuff there and we'll get tothat but it's just taking a quick step
 back can you give uh we kind of threw off thehistorian hat
 i mean you briefly said that uh in the history of ai kind of mimics thehistory of chemical engineering


0:14:48
Speaker 0 :but i keep saying machine learning you
 keep want to say ai just to let you know i don't you know ii'd resist that i don't think this is
 about ai really was john mccarthy as almost a philosopher saying wouldn'tit be cool if we could put thought in a
 computer if we could mimic the human capabilityto think or
 put intelligence in in some sense into a computerthat's an interesting philosophical
 question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy he wanted to actuallywrite down logical formula and
 algorithms that would do that and that is a perfectly valid reasonablething to do that's not what's happening
 in this era

0:15:21
Speaker 1 :right so so the reason i keep saying ai
 actually and i'd love to hear what you thinkabout it machine learning has uh
 has a very particular set of methods and

0:15:32
Speaker 0 :tools
 maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't no it does it's very very openit does optimization it does sampling it
 does

0:15:40
Speaker 1 :so systems that learn is what machine


0:15:41
Speaker 0 :learning is systems that learn and make
 decisions and make decisions so what is patternrecognition and from you know
 finding patterns it's all about making decisions in real worlds and havingclose feedback loops


0:15:52
Speaker 1 :so something like symbolic ai expert
 systems reading systems knowledge based representationall of those kinds of things search does
 that neighbor fit into what you think of asmachine learning


0:16:04
Speaker 0 :so i don't even like the word but you
 know i think that with the field you're talking about is all about making largecollections of decisions under
 uncertainty by large collections of entitiesyes right and there are principles for
 that at that scale you don't have to say the principles arefor a single entity that's making
 decisions a single agent or a single humanit really immediately goes to the
 network of decisions is a good award for that or no no there's no good words forany of this that's kind of part of the
 problem um so we can continue the conversationuse ai for all that i just want to kind
 of raise our flag here that this is notabout
 we don't know what intelligence is and real intelligence we don't know muchabout abstraction and reasoning at the
 level of humans we don't have a clue we're not trying tobuild that because we don't have a clue
 eventually it may emerge they'll make i don't know if there'll be breakthroughsbut eventually we'll start to get
 glimmers of that it's not what's happening right now thoughokay we're taking data we're trying to
 make good decisions based on that we're trying to scale we're trying to do iteconomically viably we're trying to
 build markets we're trying to keep value at that scaleand
 aspects of this will look intelligent it will look computers were so dumbbefore they will seem more intelligent
 we will use that buzz word of intelligence so we can use it in thatsense but
 you know so machine learning you can scope it narrowly is just learning fromdata and pattern recognition
 but whatever i when i talk about these topics i maybe data science is anotherword you could throw in the mix
 it really is important that the decisions are as part of it it'sconsequential decisions in the real
 world are i have a medical operation am igoing to drive down the street
 you know things that where their scarcity things thatimpact other human beings or other you
 know the environment and so on how do i do that based on data how do ido that adaptively how i use computers
 to help those kind of things go forward whatever you want to call thatso let's call it ai let's agree to call
 it ai but it's um let's let's not say that what the goalof that is
 is intelligence the goal of that is really good working systems at planetaryscale
 we've never seen before so reclaiming

0:17:56
Speaker 1 :the word ai from the dartmouth
 conference from many decades ago of the

0:18:00
Speaker 0 :dream of humanity i don't want to
 reclaim it i want a new word i think it was a bad choice i mean i i you know iif you read one of my little things um
 the history was basically that uh mccarthy needed a new name becausecybernetics already existed
 and he didn't like you know no one really liked norbert wiener you knowravina
 was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all thisand in some sense he did
 you look at the language of cybernetics it was everything we're talking about itwas control theory and single processing
 and some notions of intelligence and close feedback loops and datait was all there it's just not a word
 that lived on partly because of maybe the personalitiesbut mccarthy needed a new word to say
 i'm different from you i'm not part of your your showi got my own invented this word um
 and again as a kind of a thinking forward about the movies that would bemade about it
 uh it was a great choice but thinking forward about creating a sober academicand real world discipline it was a
 terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that weunderstand
 we understand artificial perhaps but we don't understand intelligence

0:18:59
Speaker 1 :it's a small tangent because you're one
 of the great personalities of machine learning whatever the heck you call thefield
 the do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamentalprinciples and theories
 and research that's outside of

0:19:14
Speaker 0 :personality
 both and i wouldn't say there should be one kind of personality i have mineand i have my preferences and i have a
 kind of network around me that feeds me and and some of them agreewith me and some disagree but
 all kinds of personalities are needed um right now i think the personality that'sa little too exuberant a little bit too
 ready to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendanceum and i do
 i do think that that's there's some good to that it certainly attracts lots ofyoung people to our field
 but a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions and they have tothen
 unlearn those and then find something you knowto do um and so i think there's just got
 to be some multiple voices and there's i didn't iwasn't hearing enough of the more sober
 voice

0:19:54
Speaker 1 :so uh as a continuation of a fun tangent
 and speaking of vibrant personalities what would you say is the mostinteresting disagreement you have with
 yon lacoon

0:20:06
Speaker 0 :so john's an old friend and i just say
 that i i don't think we disagree about verymuch really
 he and i both kind of have a let's build that kind of mentalityand does it work kind of mentality and
 uh kind of concrete um we both speak french and we speakfrench more together and we have we have
 a lot a lot in common um and so you know if one wanted tohighlight a
 a disagreement it's not really a fundamental one i think it's just kindof
 where we're emphasizing um jan has uh emphasized pattern recognition anduh has emphasized prediction all right
 so you know um and it's interesting to tryto take that as far as you can if you
 could do perfect prediction what would that give you kind of as a thoughtexperiment
 um and um i think that's way too limited um we cannot do perfectprediction we will never have the data
 sets allow me to figure out what you're about ready to do what question you'regoing to ask next i have no clue i will
 never know such things moreover most of us findourselves
 during the day in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation ofthat are kind of very
 very novel in various ways and in that moment we want to think throughwhat we want and also there's going to
 be market forces acting on us i'd like to go down that street but nowit's full because there's a crane in the
 street i gotta i gotta think about that i gottathink about what i might really want
 here and i gotta sort of think about how much it cost me to do this action versusthis action
 i got to think about the risks involved you know a lot of our current patternrecognition and prediction systems don't
 do any risk evaluations they have no error barsright i got to think about other
 people's decisions around me i got to think about a collection of my decisionseven just thinking about like a medical
 treatment you know i'm not going to take the prediction of a neural net about myhealth
 about something consequential am i about to have a heart attack because somenumber is over 0.7
 even if you had all the data in the world never been collected about heartattacks
 better than any doctor ever had i'm not going to trust the output of that neuralnet to predict my heart attack
 i'm going to want to ask what if questions around that i'm going to wantto look at some us or other possible
 data i didn't have causal things i'm going to have adialogue with a doctor about things we
 didn't think about we gathered the data you know it i could go on and on i hopeyou can see and i don't i think that if
 you say predictions everything that that you're missing all of thisstuff
 and so prediction plus decision making is everything but both of them areequally important
 and so the field has emphasized prediction yan rightly so has seen howpowerful that is
 but at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where therubber really hits the road where human
 lives are at stake where risks are being taken where you got to gather more datayou got to think about the arab bars you
 got to think about the consequences of your decisions on others you about theeconomy around your decisions blah blah
 blah i'm not the only one working on thosebut we're a smaller tribe and right now
 we're not the the one that people talk about themost um
 but you know if you go out in the real world in industry um you knowat amazon i'd say half the people there
 are working on decision making and the other half are doing you know thepattern recognition


0:23:04
Speaker 1 :it's important and the words of pattern
 recognition and prediction i think the distinction therenot to linger on words but the
 distinction there is more a constrained sort ofin the lab data set versus decision
 making is talking about consequential decisionsin the real world under the messiness
 and the uncertainty of the real world and just the whole of it the whole messof it that actually touches human beings
 and scale like you said market forces that's the that's the distinction yeah

0:23:30
Speaker 0 :it helps add those that perspective that
 broader perspective you're right i totally agree uh on theother hand if you're a real prediction
 person of course you want it to be in the real world you want to predict realworld events i'm just saying that's not
 possible with just data sets uh that it has to bein the context of you know
 uh strategic things that someone's doing data they might gatherthings they could have gathered the
 reasoning process around data it's not just taking data and making predictionsbased on the data


0:23:53
Speaker 1 :so one of the the things that you're
 working on i'm sure there's others working on itbut i don't hear often
 it talked about especially in the clarity that you talk about itand i think it's both the most exciting
 and the most concerning area of ai in terms of decision makingso you've talked about ai systems that
 help make decisions that scale in a distributed way millions billionsdecisions
 it's sort of markets of decisions can you as a starting point sort of give anexample of a system that you think about
 when you're thinking about these kinds

0:24:26
Speaker 0 :of systems
 uh yeah so first of all you're absolutely getting into some territorywhich
 i will be beyond my expertise and and there are lots of things that are goingto be very non-obvious to think about
 just like just again i like to think about historya little bit but think about put
 yourself back in the 60s there was kind of a banking system that wasn'tcomputerized really there was there was
 database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do iactually not just move data around but
 actual money and have it be you know valid and havetransactions that atms happen that are
 actually you know all valid and so on so forth so that's the kind ofissues you get into when you start to
 get serious about sort of things like thisi like to think about as kind of almost
 a thought experiment to help me think uh something simpler which is a musicmarket
 and uh because there is the first door there is no music marketin the world right now or in the con in
 our country for sure uh there are uh something called thingscalled record companies
 and they make money uh and they prop up a few umreally good musicians and make them
 superstars and they all make huge amounts of money butthere's a long tale of huge numbers of
 people that make lots and lots of really good music that is actually listened toby more people than the famous people
 um they are not in a market they cannothave a career they do not make money
 the creators the creators the creators the so-called influencers or whateverthat diminishes who they are
 right so there are people who make extremely good music especially in thehip-hop or latin
 world these days uh they do it on their laptop that's what they doon the weekend and they have another job
 during the week and they put it up on soundcloud or other siteseventually it gets streamed it down gets
 turned into bits it's not economically valuablethe information is lost it gets put up
 there people stream it you walk around in a big city you seepeople with headphones all you know
 especially young kids listen to music all the timeif you look at the data none of them
 very little the music they listen to is the famous people's music andnone of it's old music it's all the
 latest stuff but the people who made that latest stuff are like some 16 yearold somewhere who will never make a
 career out of this who will never make moneyof course there will be a few counter
 examples the record companies incentivize to pick out a few andhighlight them
 long story short there's a missing market there there is not aconsumer producer relationship at the
 level of the actual creative acts um the pipelines and spotifys of theworld that take this stuff and stream it
 along they make money off of subscriptions oradvertising and those things they're
 making the money all right and then they will offer bits and pieces of it to afew people again to highlight that
 you know they're they simulate a market anyway a real market would beif you're a creator of music that you
 actually are somebody who's good enough that people want to listen to youyou should have the data available to
 you there should be a dashboard showing a map of the united states so inlast week here's all the places your
 songs were listened to it should be transparent umvettable so that if someone in down in
 providence sees that you're being listened to ten thousandtimes in providence that they know
 that's real data you know it's real data they will have you come give a show downthere they will broadcast to the people
 who've been listening to you that you're comingif you do this right you could you could
 you know go down there make twenty thousand dollarsyou do that three times a year you start
 to have a career so in this sense ai creates jobsit's not about taking away human jobs
 it's creating new jobs because it creates a new marketonce you've created a market you've now
 connected up producers and consumers you know the new person who's making themusic can say to someone who comes to
 their shows a lot hey i'll play your daughter's weddingfor ten thousand dollars you'll say
 eight thousand they'll say nine thousand um then you again you you can now get anincome up to a hundred thousand dollars
 you're not going to be a millionaire all right and and now even think aboutreally the value of music is in these
 personal connections even so much so that uma young kid wants to wear a t-shirt with
 their favorite musician's signature on it rightso if they listen to the music on the
 internet the internet should be able to provide them with a button as they pushand the merchandise arrives the next day
 we can do that right and now why should we do that well because thekid who bought the shirt will be happy
 but more the person who made the music will get the moneythere's no advertising needed right so
 you could create markets between personal consumers takefive percent cut
 your company will be perfectly uh sound it'll go forward into the future and itwill create new markets and that raises
 human happiness um now this seems like it was easy justcreate this dashboard kind of create
 some connections and all that but you know if you think about uber orwhatever you think about the challenges
 in the real world of doing things like this and there are actually newprinciples going to be needed
 you're trying to create a new kind of two-way market at a different scalethat's ever been done before there's
 going to be you know unwanted aspects of the marketthere'll be bad people they'll be
 you know the data will get used in the wrong ways you know it'll fail in someways it won't deliver value you have to
 think that through just like anyone who like ran a big auction or you knowran a big matching service in economics
 will think these things through and so that maybe doesn't get at all thehuge issues that can arise when you
 start to create markets but it starts for at leastfor me solidify my thoughts and allow me
 to move forward in my own thinking

0:29:28
Speaker 1 :yeah so i talked to how to research at
 spotify actually i think their long-term goal they'vesaid is to uh
 have at least 1 million creators make a make a comfortable living putting onspotify


0:29:42
Speaker 0 :so in and


0:29:44
Speaker 1 :i think you articulate a really nice
 vision of uh the world and the digital and thecyber space of markets
 what what do you think companies like spotifyor youtube or netflix
 can do to create such markets is it an ai problem is itan interface problem so interface design
 is it uh some other kind of it was an economics problemwho should they hire to solve these


0:30:14
Speaker 0 :problems well part of it's not just top
 down so the silicon valley has its attitudethat they know how to do it they will
 create the system just like google did with the search box that will be so goodthat they'll just everyone will adopt
 that right um it's not it's it's everythingyou said but really i think missing the
 kind of culture all right so it's literally that 16 yearold who's able to create the songs
 you don't create that as a silicon valley entity you don't hire themper se right you have to create an
 ecosystem in which they are wanted and that they belong right so you haveto have some cultural credibility to do
 things like this you know netflix to their credit wantedsome of that sort of credibility they
 created shows you know content they call itcontent it's such a terrible word but
 it's called it's culture right and so with movies you can kind ofgo give a large sum of money to somebody
 graduate from the usc film school it's a whole thing of its own but it'skind of like rich white people's thing
 to do you know and you know american culturehas not been so much about rich white
 people it's been about all the immigrants allthe africans who came and brought
 that culture and those those rhythms and and thatthat to to this world and created this
 whole new thing you know american culture and and so companiescan't artificially create that they
 can't just say hey we're here we're going to buy it up you got apartner right and um
 so but anyway you know not to integrate these companies are all trying and theyshould and they
 they are i'm sure they're asking these questions and some of them are evenmaking an effort but it is
 it is partly a respect the culture as you were as a technology person you gotto blend your technology with cultural
 with cultural uh you know meaning how

0:31:49
Speaker 1 :much
 of a role do you think the algorithm machine learning has in connecting theconsumer to the creator
 sort of uh the recommender system aspect

0:31:59
Speaker 0 :of this yeah it's a great question i
 think pretty high recommend you know um there's no magic in thealgorithms but a good recommender system
 is way better than a bad recommender systemand uh recommender systems was a billion
 dollar industry back even you know 10 20 years ago um and itcontinues to be extremely important
 going forward

0:32:17
Speaker 1 :what's your favorite recommender system


0:32:19
Speaker 0 :just so we can put something well just
 historically i was one of the you know when i first went to amazon andyou know i first didn't like amazon
 because they put the book people out of business or the libraryyou know the local book sellers went out
 of business um i've come to accept that they're youknow there probably are more books being
 selled now and more people reading them thanever before and then local books stores
 are coming back so you know that's how economicssometimes work you go up and you go down
 but anyway when i finally started going there and i bought a few books i wasreally pleased to see another few books
 being recommended to me that i never would have thought ofand i bought a bunch of them so they
 obviously had a good business model but i learned thingsand i still to this day kind of browse
 using that service um and i think lots of people get a lotyou know they're
 that that is a good aspect of a recommendation system i'm learning frommy peers
 in a in an indirect way and their algorithms are not meant tohave them impose what we what we learn
 it really is trying to find out what's in the datauh it doesn't work so well for other
 kind of entities but that's just the complexity of human life likeshirts you know i'm not gonna get
 recommendations on shirts and uh but that'sthat's that's interesting uh if you try
 to recommend um uh restaurants it's it's it's it'sit's
 hard it's hard to do it at scale and and umbut uh a blend of recommendation systems
 with other economic ideas matchings and so on isreally really still
 very open research-wise and there's new companies that could emerge that do thatwell


0:33:47
Speaker 1 :what what do you think is going to the
 messy difficult land of say politics and things like that thatyoutube and twitter have to deal with in
 terms of recommendation systems being able to suggest i think facebookjust launched facebook news
 so they're having recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to beinteresting
 you think this is this ai solvable again whatever term want to use do you thinkit's a solvable problem for machines or
 is it a deeply human problem that's

0:34:17
Speaker 0 :unsolvable
 uh so i don't even think about it that level i think that what's broken withsome of these companies it's all
 monetization by advertising they're not at least facebook let's iwant to critique them they didn't really
 try to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic wayright no one wants to pay for anything
 and so they all you know starting with google andfacebook they went back to the playbook
 of you know the the television companies back in the dayno one wanted to pay for this signal
 they will pay for the tv box but not for the signalat least back in the day and so
 advertising kind of filled that gap but advertising was new and interesting andit somehow didn't take over our lives
 quite right fast forward google provides aservice that people don't want to pay
 for um and so somewhat surprising in the 90sthey made
 end up making huge amounts they cornered the advertising market it didn't seemlike that was going to happen at least
 to me um these little things on the right handside of the screen just did not seem all
 that economically interesting but that companies had maybe no other choice thetv market was going away and billboards
 and so on um so they've they got it and i thinkthat sadly that uh google just has me it
 was doing so well with that and making such right they didn't think much moreabout how wait a minute
 is there a producer consumer relationship to be set up here not justuh between us and the advertisers
 market to be created is there an actual market between the producer and consumerthey're the producers the person who
 created that video clip the person that made thatwebsite the person who could make more
 such things the person who could adjust it and as a function of demandthe person on the other side who's
 asking for different kinds of things you know soyou see glimmers of that now there's
 influencers and there's kind of a little glimmering of a market but it shouldhave been done 20 years ago it should
 have been thought about it should have been created in parallel with theadvertising ecosystem
 and then facebook inherited that and i think they also didn't think very muchabout that
 so fast forward and now they are making huge amounts of money off of advertisingand the news thing and all these clicks
 is just is feeding the advertising it's all connected up to the advertiserso you want more people to click on
 certain things because that money flows to youfacebook you're very much incentivized
 to do that and when you start to find it's breakingpeople are telling you well we're
 getting into some troubles you try to adjust it with your smart aialgorithms right and figure out what are
 bad clicks though maybe shouldn't be click-through rate it should besomething
 i find that pretty much hopeless it does get into all the complexity in lifeand you can try to fix it you should but
 you could also fix the whole business modeland the business model is that really
 what are are there some human producers and consumers out thereis there some economic value to be
 liberated by connecting them directly is it such that it's so valuable that uhpeople are willing to pay for it
 all right and micro payments like smart micro but even have to be microso i i like the example suppose i'm
 going next week i'm going to india never been to india beforeright uh i have a couple days in in
 mumbai um i have no idea what to do there rightand i could go on the web right now and
 search it's going to be kind of hopeless i'm not going to find you knowum i'll have lots of advertisers in my
 face right what i really want to do is broadcast tothe world that i am going to mumbai
 and have someone on the other side of a market look at me andand there's a recommendation system
 there so i'm not looking at all possible people coming to mumbai they're lookingat the people who are relevant to them
 so someone my age group someone who kind ofknows me in some level i give up a
 little privacy by that but i'm happy because what i'm going to get back isthis person's going to make a little
 video for me or they're going to write a littletwo-page paper on here's the cool things
 that you want to do and move by this week especiallyright i'm going to look at that i'm not
 going to pay a micro payment i'm going to pay you know 100or whatever for that it's real value
 it's like journalism um as i'm not a subscription it's that i'mgonna pay that person in that moment
 company's gonna take five percent of that and that person has now got it it'sa gig economy if you will but you know
 done for in you know thinking about a little bitbehind youtube there was actually people
 who could make more of those things if they were connected to amarket they would make more of those
 things independently you have to tell them whatto do you don't have to incentivize them
 any other way um and so yeah these companies i don'tthink have thought long long and hard
 about that so i do distinguish on you know facebook onthe one side who just not thought about
 these things at all i think uh thinking that ai will fix everythinguh and amazon thinks about them all the
 time because they were already out in the real world they were deliveringpackages people's doors they were they
 were worried about a market they were worrying about sellers and you know theyworry and
 some things they do are great some things maybe not so great but you knowthey're in that business model and then
 i'd say google sort of hover somewhere in betweeni don't i don't think for a long long
 time they they got it i think they probably see that youtubeis more pregnant with possibility than
 than than they might have thought and that they'reprobably heading that direction um
 but uh you know silicon valley's been dominated by the google facebook kind ofmentality and the subscription and
 advertising and that is that's the core problemright the fake news actually rides on
 top of that because it means that you're monetizingwith click-through rate and that is the
 core problem you got to remove that

0:39:06
Speaker 1 :so advertisement if you're going to
 linger on that i mean that's an interesting thesis i don't know ifeveryone really deeply thinks about that
 so you're right the thought is the advertising model is the only thingwe have the only thing we'll ever have
 so we have to fix we have to build algorithmsthat despite that business model
 you know find the better angels of our nature and do good by society and by theindividual
 but you think we can slowly you think first of allthere's a difference between should and
 could so you're saying we should slowly move away from theadvertising model and have a direct
 connection between the consumer and the creatorthe the question i also have is can we
 because the advertising model is so successfulnow in terms of just making a huge
 amount of money and therefore being able to build a bigcompany that provides has really smart
 people working that create a good service do you think it'spossible and just to clarify you think
 we should

0:40:07
Speaker 0 :move away well i think we should yeah
 but uh we is you know me so society yeah will the companies umi mean so first of all full disclosure
 i'm doing a day a week at amazon because i kind of want to learn more about howthey do things so you know i'm not
 speaking for amazon in any way but um you know i did go there because iactually believe they get a little bit
 of this are trying to create these markets

0:40:25
Speaker 1 :and they don't really use advertising is


0:40:29
Speaker 0 :not a crucial part of it that's a good
 question so it has become not crucial but it'sbecome more and more present if you go
 to amazon website and you know without revealing too manydeep secrets about amazon i can tell you
 that you know a lot of people company question thisand there's a huge questioning going on
 you do not want a world where there's zero advertising that actually is a badworld
 okay so here's a way to think about it you'rea company that like amazon is trying to
 bring products to customers all right and the customer at any givenyou want to buy a vacuum cleaner say
 you want to know what's available for me and you know it's not gonna be thatobvious you have to do a little bit of
 work at it the recommendation system will sort ofhelp all right but now suppose this
 other person over here has just made the world you know they spent a huge amountof energy they had a great idea they
 made a great vacuum cleaner they know they they really did it theynailed it it's an mit you know
 whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner all right it's not going to bein the recommendation system
 no one will know about it the algorithms will not find it and ai will not fixthat
 okay at all right how do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to getin front of people be sold well
 advertising and here what advertising is it's a signalthat you're you believe in your product
 enough that you're willing to pay some real money for itand to me as a consumer i look at that
 signal i say well first of all i know these are not just cheap little adsbecause we have now right now i know
 that you know these are super cheap you knowpennies uh if i see an ad where it's
 actually i know the company is only doing a few of these and they're makingyou know
 real money is kind of flowing and i see an ad i may pay more attention to it andi actually might want that
 because i see hey that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaneror maybe there's something good there so
 i will look at it and and so that's part of the overall information flow in agood market
 uh so advertising has a role um but the problem is of course that thatsignal is now completely gone
 because it just you know dominar by these tiny little things that add up tobig money
 for the company you know so i i think it will justi think it will change because the
 societies just don't you know stick with things thatannoy a lot of people and advertising
 currently annoys people more than it provides informationand i think that at google probably is
 smart enough to figure out that this is a dead this is a bad modeleven though it's a hard huge amount of
 money and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it and slowlyand i'm sure the ceo there will figure
 it out but um they need to do it and uh they need toso if you reduce advertising not to zero
 but you reduce it at the same time you bring upproducer consumer actual real value
 being delivered so real money is being paid and they take a five percent cutthat five percent could start to get big
 enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the the kind of the poor kind ofadvertising and i think that a good
 company will will do that we'll realize that um andthey're com you know facebook you know
 again god bless them they they bring you know grandmother'suh you know uh they bring children's
 pictures into grandmother's lives it's fantasticum but they need to think of a new
 business model and and they that's that's the coreproblem there um until they start to
 connect producer consumer i think they will justjust continue to make money and then buy
 the next social network company and then buy the next oneand the innovation level will not be
 high and the health the health issues will not go away so i

0:43:34
Speaker 1 :apologize that we kind of return to
 words i don't think the exact terms matter butin sort of defensive advertisement
 don't you think the kind of direct connection between consumerand creator producer
 is the best like the is what advertisement strives to doright so that is the best advertisement
 is literally now facebook is listening to ourconversation and heard that you're going
 to india and we'll be able to actually startautomatically for you making these
 connections and start giving this offer so like iapologize if it's just a matter of terms
 but just to draw a distinction is it possible to make advertisements justbetter and better and better
 algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection almost

0:44:25
Speaker 0 :address that's a good question so let's
 component all that push first of all i i what we justtalked about i was defending advertising
 okay so i was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don'tcome any other way
 especially algorithmically it's a sign that someone spent money on it it's asign they think it's valuable
 and if i think that if other things someone else thinks it's valuableand if i trust other people i might be
 willing to listen i don't trust that facebook though is who's an intermediarybetween this
 i don't think they care about me okay i don't think they do and i find itcreepy that they know i'm going to india
 next week because of our conversation why do you think that

0:45:01
Speaker 1 :can we so what can you just put your pr
 hat on why do you think you find facebook uhcreepy and not trust them as
 as do majority of the population so they'reout of the silicon valley companies i
 saw like not approval rate but there's there's ranking of how much people trustcompanies and facebook is in in the


0:45:22
Speaker 0 :gutter
 in the gutter including people inside of facebook so what

0:45:25
Speaker 1 :uh what do you attribute that to because


0:45:28
Speaker 0 :when i come on you don't find it creepy
 that right now we're talking i might walk out on the street right now thatsome unknown person who i don't know
 kind of comes up to me and says i hear you going to india i mean that's noteven facebook that's just a
 if i want transparency in human society i want to have if you know somethingabout me there's actually some reason
 you know something about me that's something that if i look at itlater and audit it kind of i approve
 you know something about me because you care in some way there's a caringrelationship
 even or an economic one or something not just that you're someone who couldexploit it in ways i don't
 know about or care about or or i'm troubled by or or whateverand we're in a world right now where
 that happens way too much and that facebook knows things about alot of people and
 could exploit it and does exploit it at times i think most people do find thatcreepy it's not for them it's not
 it's not that it's facebook that's not doing it because they care about themright in any real sense and they
 shouldn't they should not be a big brother caring about us that is not therole of a company like that


0:46:28
Speaker 1 :why not wait not the big brother part
 but the sharing the trust thing i mean don't those companies just to lingerbecause a lot of companies have a lot of
 information about us i would argue that there's companieslike microsoft that has more information
 about us than facebook does and yet we trust

0:46:45
Speaker 0 :microsoft more well microsoft is
 pivoting microsoft you know under satya nadellahas decided this is really important
 we don't want to do creepy things we really want people to trust us toactually only use information in ways
 that they really would approve of that we don't decideright and um i'm just kind of adding
 that the health the health of a market is thatuh when i connect to someone who
 produces a consumer it's not just a random producer consumer it'speople who see each other they don't
 like each other but they sense that if they transactsome happiness will go up on both sides
 if a company helps me to do that and moments that i choose of my choosingthen fine so and also think about the
 difference between you know browsing versus buying right there aremoments in my life i just want to buy
 you know a gadget or something i need something for that moment i need someammonia for my house or something
 because i got a problem a spill i want to just go in i don'twant to be advertised
 at that moment i don't want to be led down very dire you know that's annoyingi want to just go and have it
 extremely easy to do what i want um other moments i might say no it's liketoday i'm going to the shopping mall
 i want to walk around and see things and see people and be exposed to stuff so iwant control over that though i don't
 want the company's algorithms to decide for meright and i think that's the thing we
 it's a total loss of control if facebook thinks they should take the control fromus
 of deciding when we want to have certain kinds of information when we don't whatinformation that is
 how much it relates to what they know about us that we didn't really want themto know about us
 they're not i don't want them to be helping me in that way i don't want themto be helping them but they decide
 well they have control over um um what i want and when

0:48:22
Speaker 1 :i totally agree so facebook by the way i
 have this optimistic thing where i think facebook has the kind ofpersonal information about us
 that could create a beautiful thing so i i'm really optimisticof what facebook could do uh it's not
 what it's doing but what it could do

0:48:38
Speaker 0 :so i don't see that i think that
 optimism is misplaced because there's not a bit you have tohave a business model behind these
 things yes create a beautiful thing is really let'sbe let's be clear
 it's about something that people would value and and i don't think they havethat business model
 and i don't think they they will suddenly discover it by what you knowhave
 a long hot shower i disagree i disagree

0:48:58
Speaker 1 :in terms of uh you can discover a lot of
 amazing things in the shower so if i didn't say that i

0:49:04
Speaker 0 :said they won't come they won't they
 won't do it but in the shower i think a lot of otherpeople will discover it i think that
 this guy so i should also uh full disclosure there's a companycalled united masters which i'm on their
 board and they've created this music marketyes they have a hundred thousand artists
 now signed on and they've done things like gone to the nbaand the nba the music you find behind me
 the eclipse right now is their music right that's a company that had theright business model in mind from the
 get-go right executed on that and and from dayone there was value brought to
 so here you have a kid who made some songs who suddenly their songs are onthe nba website
 right that that's real economic value to peopleand uh so you know so you and i differ


0:49:45
Speaker 1 :on the optimism of being able to
 sort of uh um change the direction of the titanic

0:49:55
Speaker 0 :right so i yeah i'm older than you so i
 think titanic's crash got it

0:49:59
Speaker 1 :but uh so and just to elaborate because
 i totally agree with you and i just want to know how difficult you think thisproblem is of
 so for example i um i want to read some newsand i would there's a lot of times in
 the day where something makes me either smileor think in a way where i like
 consciously think this really gave me valuelike i sometimes listen to uh the daily
 podcast in the new york times way better than the new york timesthemselves by the way for people
 listening that's like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcastspace it doesn't make sense to me
 but often i'll listen to it 20 minutes and ii would be willing to pay for that like
 five dollars ten dollars for that experience absolutelyand how difficult that's kind of what
 you're getting at is that little transactionhow difficult is it to create a
 frictionless system like uber has for examplefor other things what's your intuition


0:50:54
Speaker 0 :there uh so i first of all
 i pay little bits of money to you know to say there's something called courtsthat does financial things i like medium
 as a site i don't pay there but um i would you had a great post on

0:51:04
Speaker 1 :medium
 i would have loved to pay you a dollar

0:51:08
Speaker 0 :and but i wouldn't
 want it i wouldn't have wanted it per se because umthere should be also sites where that's
 not actually the goal the goal is to actually have a broadcast channelthat i monetize in some other way if i
 chose to i mean i could now people know about it i could i'm notdoing it but um
 that's fine with me there also the musicians who are making all this musici don't think the right model is that
 you pay a little subscription fee to them all right because because peoplecan copy the bits too easily and it's
 just not that somewhere the value is the value is that a connection was madebetween real human beings then you can
 follow up on that right and create yet more value so no ithink um


0:51:45
Speaker 1 :there's a lot of open questions here hot


0:51:45
Speaker 0 :open questions but also yeah i do want
 good recommendation systems that recommendcool stuff to me and but it's pretty
 hard right i don't like them to recommend stuff just based on mybrowsing history
 i don't like that based on stuff they know about me quote quote what's unknownabout me is the most interesting


0:52:01
Speaker 1 :so this is the this is the really
 interesting question we may disagree maybe noti think that i love recommender systems
 and i want to give them everything about me in a way that i trust

0:52:12
Speaker 0 :yeah but you but you don't because so
 for example this morning i clicked on i you know i was pretty sleepy thismorning um i
 clicked on a story about the queen of england yesright i do not give a damn about the
 queen of england i really do not but it was clickbait it kind of lookedfunny and i had to say what the heck are
 they talking about i don't want to have my lifeyou know heading that direction now
 that's in my browsing history the system in any reasonable systemwe'll think about
 history right but but you're saying all the trace all the digital exhaust orwhatever that's been kind of the models
 if you collect all this stuff you're gonna figure all of us out wellif you're trying to figure out like kind
 of one person like trump or something maybe you could figure him outbut if you're trying to figure out you
 know 500 million people you know no way no way do you think sono i do
 i think so i think we are humans are just amazingly rich and complicatedevery one of us has our little quirks
 everyone else has our little things that could intrigue us that we don't evenknow and will intrigue us
 and there's no sign of it in our past but by god there it comes andyou know you fall in love with it and i
 don't want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that okaywell
 i want them to provide a forum a market a place that i kind of goand by hook or by crook this happens you
 know i i'm walking down the street and i hearsome chilean music being played and i
 never knew i like chili music but wow so there is that side and i want them toprovide a limited but you know
 interesting place to go right and so don't try touse your ai to kind of
 you know figure me out and then put me in a world where you figured me outyou know no create huge spaces for human
 beings where our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forwardand it'll be a lot more transparency i
 won't have people randomly anonymously putting comments upand especially based on stuff they know
 about me facts that you know we are so broken right now if you'reyou know especially if you're a
 celebrity but you know it's about anybody thatuh anonymous people are hurting lots and
 lots of people right now and that's part of thisthing that silicon valley is thinking
 that you know just collect all this information and use it in a great way sono i i'm
 i'm not i'm not a pessimism i'm very much an optimist by nature but i thinkthat's just been the wrong path for the
 whole technology to take be more limited create let humans riseup
 don't don't try to replace them that's the ai mantra don't try toanticipate them don't try to predict
 them because you're you're not good at you're notgoing to do those things you're going to
 make things worse

0:54:34
Speaker 1 :okay so right now just give this a
 chance uh right now the recommender systems arethe creepy people in the shadow
 watching your every move so they're looking at traces of youthey're not directly interacting with
 you sort of the your close friends and family the waythey know you is by having conversation
 by actually having interactions back and forthdo you think there's a place for
 recommender systems sort of to step because you you justemphasize the value of human to human
 connection but yeah just give it a chance ai humanconnection is there a role for an ass
 system to have conversations with you in terms of to try to figure out whatkind of music you like not by just
 watching what you're listening but actually having a conversationnatural language or otherwise yeah no


0:55:19
Speaker 0 :i'm i'm so i'm not against it
 i just want to push back against them maybe you're saying you have options forfacebook so
 there i think it's misplaced but but um i think that this onepending facebook yeah now so good for
 you um go for it that's a hard spot to beyeah no good human interaction like on
 our daily the context around me in my own home issomething that i don't want some big
 company to know about at all but i would be more than happy to have technologyhelp me with it
 which kind of technology well you know just alexa amazon well a goodalexa's done right i think alex is a
 research platform right now more than anything elsebut alexa done right you know could do
 things like i i leave the water running in my gardenand i say hey alex so the waters are in
 my garden um and even have alexa figure out thatthat means when my wife comes home that
 she should be told about that that's a little bit of a reasoning icall that ai and by any kind of stretch
 it's a little bit of reasoning and it actually kind of makes my life a littleeasier and better
 and you know i don't i wouldn't call this a wow moment but i kind of thinkthat
 overall rises human happiness up to have that kind of thing

0:56:18
Speaker 1 :um but not when you're lonely alexa
 knowing loneliness

0:56:21
Speaker 0 :no no there i don't want to let you that
 be feel intrusive and i and i don't want just the designer ofthe system to kind of work all this out
 i really want to have a lot of control and i want transparency and control andif the company can stand up and give me
 that in the context of new technology i think they're good first of all be waymore successful than our current
 generation and like i said i was mentioningmicrosoft earlier i really think
 they're pivoting to kind of be the trusted old uncle but you know i thinkthat they get that this is the way to go
 that if you let people find technology empowers them to havemore control and have and have control
 not just over privacy but over this rich set of interactionsum that that people gonna like that a
 lot more and that's that's the right business model going forward

0:57:00
Speaker 1 :what does control over privacy look like
 do you think you should be able to just viewall the data that no it's much more than


0:57:04
Speaker 0 :that i mean first of all it should be an
 individual decision some people don't want privacy they wanttheir whole life out there other
 people's want it um privacy is not a zero one it's not alegal thing it's not just about which
 data is available which is not um i like to recall to people that youknow
 a couple hundred years ago everyone there was not really big cities everyonelived down the countryside and villages
 um and in villages everybody knew everything about you very youdidn't have any privacy is that bad are
 we better off now well you know arguably no because whatdid you get for that loss of
 at least certain kinds of privacy um well uhpeople helped each other if they because
 they know everything about you they know something's bad's happening they willhelp you with that
 right and now you live in a big city no one knows their mouth you get no helpum so uh it kind of depends the answer i
 want certain people who i trust and there should berelationships i should kind of manage
 all those but who knows what about me i should havesome agency there it shouldn't i
 shouldn't be a drift in a sea of technology wherei have no idea
 i don't want to go reading things and checking boxesso i don't know how to do this and i'm
 not a privacy researcher per se i just i recognize the vast complexity of thisit's not just technology it's not just
 legal scholars meeting technologists there's got to be kind ofwhole layers around it and so i when i
 allude to this emerging engineering fieldthis is a big part of it um like when
 electrical engineering come came i'm not wasn't around in the timebut you just didn't
 plug electricity you know into walls and it all kind of worked you don't have tohave like
 underwriter's laboratory that reassured you that that plug's not going to burnup your house
 and that that machine will do this and that and everything there'll be wholepeople who can install things there'll
 be people who can watch the installers there'll be a wholelayers you know an onion of these kind
 of things and for things as deeply interesting as privacy which is hisleast essential electricity
 um that that's gonna take decades to kind of work out but it's gonna requirea lot of new structures that we don't
 have right now so it's kind of hard to talk about it

0:59:01
Speaker 1 :and you're saying there's a lot of money
 to be made if you get it right so absolutely

0:59:05
Speaker 0 :a lot of money to be made and all these
 things that provide human services and people recognize them as useful partsof their lives uh so yeah um so yeah the
 dialect sometimes goes from the exuberant technologiststo the no technology is good kind of and
 that's you know in our public discourse you know in newspapers you see too muchof this kind of thing
 and and the sober discussions in the middle which are the challenging ones tohave are where we need to be having our
 conversations and you know there's not actuallythere's not many forum forum for those
 um you know there's that's that's kind of what i would look for maybe i couldgo and i could read a comment section of
 something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue going back andforth you don't see much of this right
 which is why actually there's a

0:59:46
Speaker 1 :resurgence of
 podcasts out of all because good people are really hungry for conversationbut their technology is not helping
 much so comment sections of anything including youtubeyeah is not hurting i'm not hurting yeah
 and you think technically speaking it's possible

1:00:07
Speaker 0 :to help i don't know the answers but
 it's it's a it's a less anonymity a little more locality umyou know worlds that you kind of enter
 in and you trust the people there in those worlds so that when you starthaving a discussion you know
 not only is that people not gonna hurt you but it's not gonna be a total wasteyour time
 because there's a lot of wasting of time that you know a lot of us i i pulled outof facebook early on because it was
 clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there was some value um andso yeah
 worlds that are somehow you enter in you know what you're getting and it's kindof
 appeals to you might new things might happen but you kind of have somesome trust in that world and there's


1:00:40
Speaker 1 :some
 deep interesting complex psychological aspects around anonymityuh how that changes human behavior
 indeed quite dark

1:00:49
Speaker 0 :and quite dark yeah i think a lot of us
 are especially those of us who really love the adventof technology i loved social networks
 when it came out i was just i didn't see any negatives there at allbut then i started
 uh seeing comment sections i think it was maybe you know cnn or somethingand i started going wow this this
 darkness i just did not know about and um and our technology is nowamplifying it


1:01:12
Speaker 1 :so sorry for the big philosophical
 question but on that topic do you think human beings because you've also out ofall things had
 a foot in psychology too the do you think human beings arefundamentally good like
 all of us have good intent that could be minedor is it depending on context and
 environment everybody could be evil thought my

1:01:34
Speaker 0 :answer is
 fundamentally good um but fundamentally limitedall of us have very you know blinkers on
 we don't see the other person's pain that easily we don't see the otherperson's point of view that easily
 we're very much in our own head in our own worldand on my good days i think that
 technology could open us up to you know more perspectives and more lessblinkered and more understanding
 you know a lot of wars in human history happen because of just ignorancethey didn't they they thought the other
 person was doing this well other person wasn't doing this and we have hugeamounts of that
 um but in my lifetime i've not seen technology really help in that wayyet and i do i do i do believe in that
 but you know no i think fundamentally humansare good the people suffer
 people have grievances because you have grudges and those things cause them todo things they probably wouldn't want
 they regret it often um so no i i i think it's a you know part of theprogress of technology is to indeed
 allow it to be a little easier to be the realgood person you actually are


1:02:32
Speaker 1 :well but do you think individual human
 life or society could be modeled as anoptimization problem


1:02:40
Speaker 0 :um not the way i think typically i mean
 that's your time one of the most complex phenomena in thewhole you know in all


1:02:47
Speaker 1 :ways individual human life for society


1:02:49
Speaker 0 :as a whole both
 both i mean individual human life is amazingly complex and umso uh you know optimization is kind of
 just one branch of mathematics that talks about certain kind of things anduh it just
 feels way too limited for the complexity of such things

1:03:04
Speaker 1 :what properties of optimization problems
 do you think so do you think most interesting problems that could besolved through optimization
 uh what kind of properties does that surface have non-convexity convexitylinearity
 all those kinds of things saddle points

1:03:19
Speaker 0 :well so optimization's just one piece of
 mathematics you know there's like you justeven in our era we're aware that say
 sampling um is coming up with examples ofsomething um coming up with a
 description

1:03:31
Speaker 1 :what's sampling well you they you can if


1:03:32
Speaker 0 :you're a kind of a certain kind of
 mathematician you can try to blend them and make themseem to be sort of the same thing but
 optimization is roughly speaking trying touh find a point that um a single point
 that is the optimum of a criterion function of somekind um
 and sampling is trying to from that same surfacetreat that as a distribution or density
 and find prop points that have high density so umi i want the entire distribution and the
 sampling paradigm and i want the um you know the the single point that's thebest point in the par in the sample
 in the uh optimization paradigm now if you were optimizing in the space ofprobability measures
 the output of that could be a whole probability distribution so you canstart to make these things
 the same but in mathematics if you go too high up that kind of abstraction arcyou start to lose
 the uh you know the ability to do the interesting theorems so you kind ofdon't try to you don't try to overly
 over abstract so as a small tangent

1:04:26
Speaker 1 :what kind of world view do you find more
 appealing one that is deterministic or stochastic

1:04:35
Speaker 0 :well that's easy i mean i'm a
 statistician you know the world is highly stochastic wait i don't knowwhat's going to happen in the next five
 minutes right because you're going to ask whatwe're going to do
 massive uncertainty yeah you know massive uncertainty and so the best ican do is have come
 rough sense or probability distribution on things and somehow use that in myreasoning about what to do
 now so

1:04:59
Speaker 1 :how does the distributed at scale when
 you have multi-agent systems look like so optimization can optimizesort of
 it makes a lot more sense sort of uh at least fromfrom a robotics perspective for a single
 robot for a single agent trying to optimize some objective functionwhen you start to enter the real world
 this game theoretic concept starts popping upand that how do you see optimization in
 this because you've talked about markets in ascale what does that look like
 do you see this optimization do you see it as sampling do you seelike how how should you modify these all


1:05:37
Speaker 0 :blend together um and a system designer
 thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have ablend of all these things so
 you know a particle in a potential well is optimizing a function calledlagrangian
 right the particle doesn't know that there's no algorithm runningthat does that it just happens it's so
 it's a description mathematically of something that helps usunderstand as analysts what's happening
 right and so the same will happen when we talk about you know mixtures ofhumans and computers
 and markets and so on so forth there'll be certain principles that allow us tounderstand what's happening and whether
 or not the actual algorithms are being used by any senseit's not clear now at some point i may
 have set up a multi-agent or market kind of systemand i'm now thinking about an individual
 agent in that system and they're asked to do some tasks andthey're incentivized in some way they
 get certain signals and they they have some utility maybe what theywill do at that point is they just won't
 know the answer they may have to optimize to find an answerokay so an autism could be embedded
 inside of an overall market you know and game theory is is very verybroad it is often
 studied very narrowly for certain kinds of problemsbut it's roughly speaking this is just
 the i don't know what you're going to do so i kind of anticipate that a littlebit
 and you anticipate what i'm anticipating and we kind of go back and forth in ourown minds we run kind of thought
 experiments

1:06:55
Speaker 1 :you talked about this interesting point
 in terms of game theory you know most optimization problemsreally hate
 saddle points maybe you can describe what saddle points are buti've heard you kind of mentioned that
 there's a there's a branch of optimizationyou could try to explicitly look for
 saddle points that's a good thing oh not optimization

1:07:14
Speaker 0 :that's just game theory that that's so
 uh there's all kinds of differentequilibria in game theory and some of
 them are highly explanatory behavior they're not attempting to be algorithmicthey're just trying to say if you happen
 to be at this equilibrium you would see certain kind of behaviorand we see that in real life that's what
 an economist wants to do especially behavioral economistum uh in in continuous
 uh differential game theory you're in continuous spacesa um some of the simplest equilibria are
 saddle points a nash equilibrium is a saddle pointit's a special kind of salon point so
 classically in game theory you were trying to find nash equilibriaand algorithmic games here you're trying
 to find algorithms that would find them and so you're trying to find saddlepoints i mean so that's literally what
 you're trying to do um but you know any economist knows thatnash equilibria have their limitations
 they are definitely not that explanatory in many situationsthey're not what you really want um
 there's other kind of equilibria and there's names associated with thesebecause they came from history with
 certain people working on them but there will be new ones emergingso you know one example is a stackelberg
 equilibrium so you know nash you and i are bothplaying this game against each other or
 for each other maybe it's cooperative and we're both going to think it throughand then we're going to decide and we're
 going to off you know do our thing simultaneously you know in a stackelbergno i'm going to be the first mover i'm
 going to make a move you're going to look at my move and thenyou're going to make yours now since i
 know you're going to look at my move i anticipate what you're going to do andso i don't do something stupid
 but and but then i know that you were also anticipating me so we're kind ofgoing back and so far am i but there is
 then a first mover thing and so there's a those aredifferent equilibria
 all right and uh so just mathematically yeah these things have certaintopologies certain shapes they're like
 southwest and algorithmically or dynamically how do you move towards themhow do you move away from things
 um you know so some of these questions have answers they've been studiedothers do not and especially if it
 becomes stochastic especially if there's large numbers ofdecentralized things there's just uh you
 know young people getting in this field who kind of think it's all done becausewe have you know tensorflow
 well no these are all open problems and they're really important and interestingand it's about
 strategic settings how do i collect data suppose i don't know what you're goingto do because i don't know you very well
 right well i got to kind of date about you so maybe i want to push you in apart of the space where i don't know
 much about you so i can get data because and then later i'll realize that you'llnever you'll never go there because of
 the way the game is set up but you know that's part of the overallyou know data analysis context is that


1:09:44
Speaker 1 :yeah even the game of poker is
 fascinating space whenever there's any uncertainty yourlack of information is it's a
 super exciting space yeah uh just uh lingard optimization for a second soif we look at deep learning it's
 essentially minimization of a complicated lossfunction
 so is there something insightful or hopeful that you seein the kinds of function surface that
 loss functions that deep learning in in the real worldis trying to optimize over is there
 something interesting this is just the usual kind of problemsof optimization


1:10:19
Speaker 0 :i think from an optimization point of
 view that surface first of all it's pretty smoothum and secondly if there's over if it's
 over parameterized there's kind of lots of paths down to reasonable optimaand so kind of the getting downhill to
 the to an optimum is viewed as not as hard as you might have expectedin high dimensions the fact that some
 optima tend to be really good ones and others not so good and you tend to it'snot
 sometimes you find the good ones is sort of still needs explanationyes but but the particular surface is
 coming from the particular generation of neural nets i kind of suspect those willthis
 those will change in 10 years it will not be exactly those surfaces there'llbe some others that are
 and optimization theory will help contribute to why other surfaces are whyother algorithms
 layers of arithmetic operations with a little bit of nonlinearitythat's not that didn't come from
 neuroscience per se i mean maybe in the minds of some of the people working onit they were thinking
 about brains but uh they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields you knowuh computer science control theory and
 so on and that layers of these could transformthings in certain ways and that
 if it's smooth maybe you could uh you know find parameter valuesum you know it's a big is a is
 a sort of big discovery that it's it's working it's able to work at this scalebut um
 um i don't think that we're stuck with that and we're certainly not stuck withthat because we're understanding the
 brain

1:11:41
Speaker 1 :so in terms of uh on the algorithm size
 of gradient descent do you think we're stuck with gradientdescent this is uh variants of it what
 variants do you find interesting or do you think there'll be something elseinvented
 that uh is able to walk all over these optimization spaces in more interestingways


1:11:59
Speaker 0 :so there's a co-design of the surface
 and or the architecture and the algorithmso if you just ask if we stay with the
 kind of architectures we have now and not just neural nets but you knowphase retrieval architectures or
 materials completion architectures and so onum you know i think we've kind of come
 to a place where yeah a stochastic gradient algorithms aredominant
 and um there are versions uh they're you know that are a little better thanothers they you know have more
 guarantees they're more robust and and so on and there's ongoing research tokind of figure out which is the best
 downforce situation um but i think that that'll start toco-evolve that that'll put pressure on
 the actual architecture and so we shouldn't do it in this particular waywe should do it in a different way
 because this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a differentway
 um so uh that that i can't really anticipate thatco-evolution process but
 you know gradients are amazing uh mathematical objectsum they uh have a lot of people who
 uh start to study them more deeply mathematicallyare kind of shocked about what what they
 are and what they can do um i mean to think about this way if uhsuppose that i tell you if you move
 along the x-axis you get uh uh uh you know you go uphill in someobjective by you know three units
 whereas if you move on the y-axis you go uphill byseven units right now i'm gonna only
 allow you to move a certain you know unit distanceall right what are you gonna do well the
 most not people will say i'm gonna go along the y-axis i'mgetting the biggest bang for my buck
 you know and my buck is only one unit so i'm gonna put all of it in the y-axisright
 and uh why should i even take any of my strength my step size and put any of itin the x-axis because i'm getting less
 bang for my buck that seems like a completely you knowclear cl
 argument and it's wrong because the gradient direction is not to go alongthe y-axis
 it's to take a little bit of the x-axis uh and thatto understand that you have to you have
 to know some math and um so even a you know trivial soso-called operator like grading is not
 trivial and so you know exploiting its properties isstill very very important um now we know
 that just providing descent has got all kinds of problems it gets stuck in manyways and it hadn't have
 you know good dimension dependence and so on so ummy own line of work recently has been
 about what kinds of stochasticity how can we get dimension dependence howcan we do the theory of that
 um and we've come up pretty favorable results with certain kinds ofstochasticity
 we have sufficient conditions generally we know if you if you do this we willgive you a good guarantee
 we don't have necessary conditions that it must be done a certain way in general

1:14:32
Speaker 1 :so stochasticity how much randomness to
 inject into the into the walking along the gradient andwhat kind of randomness


1:14:39
Speaker 0 :

1:14:39
Speaker 1 :why is randomness good in this process
 why is stochasticity good

1:14:44
Speaker 0 :yeah so um i give you simple answers but
 in some sense again it's kind of amazing stochasticity justuh um you know particular features of a
 surface that could have hurt you if you were doing one thingum deterministically it won't hurt you
 because uh you know by chance there's very littlechance that you would get hurt
 and um you know so here stochasticity um you know is just kind ofsaves you from some of the particular
 features of surfaces that um you know and in fact if you thinkabout
 you know surfaces that are discontinuous in a first derivative like you knowabsolute value function
 um you will go down and hit that point where there's non-differentiabilityright and if you're running a
 deterministic argument at that point you can really do something badright whereas stochasticity just means
 it's pretty unlikely that's going to happenyou're going to you're going to hit that
 point so you know it's again not trivially analyzed but umespecially in higher dimensions also
 stochasticity our intuition isn't very good about it but it hasproperties that kind of are very
 appealing in high dimensions for a lot of large number of reasonsum so it's it's all part of the
 mathematics to kind of that's what's fun to work in the field is that you get totry to
 understand this mathematics and um but long story short you know partlyempirically it was discovered stochastic
 gradient is very effective and theory kind of followed i'd say um thatbut
 i don't see that we're getting clearly out of that uh

1:16:08
Speaker 1 :what's the most beautiful mysterious a
 profound idea

1:16:14
Speaker 0 :to you in optimization i don't know the
 most but let me just say that uh you knownestorov's work on nest drive
 acceleration to me is uh pretty pretty surprising andpretty deep


1:16:26
Speaker 1 :um can you elaborate well install


1:16:26
Speaker 0 :acceleration is just that um
 i suppose that we are going to use gradients to move around into space forthe reasons i've alluded to there there
 are nice directions to move and suppose that i tell you that you're only allowedto use gradients
 you're not going to be allowed to you'll see this local person it can only sensekind of a change in the surface
 um but i'm going to give you kind of a computer that's able to store all yourprevious gradients and so you start to
 learn some something about the the surface umand i'm going to restrict you to maybe
 move in the direction of like a linear span of all the gradientsso you can't kind of just move in some
 arbitrary direction right so now we have a well-definedmathematical complexity model there's a
 certain classes of algorithms that can do that and others that can'tand we can ask for certain kinds of
 surfaces how fast can you get down to the optimumso there's an answers to these so for a
 you know a smooth convex function there's an answer whichis one over the number of steps squared
 you will be within a ball of that size after after k steps umgradient descent in particular has a
 slower rate it's one over k okay um so you could ask is gradient issaid actually even though we know it's a
 good algorithm is it the best algorithm in the sense of the answer is nowell well not clear yet because what
 one of our case score is a lower bound that's that's probably the best you cando
 what gradient is one over k but is there something betterand so i think as a surprise to most
 though nest drove discovered a new algorithmthat is got two pieces to it it uses two
 gradients um and uh puts those together in acertain kind of obscure way
 and uh the thing doesn't even move downhill all the time it sometimes goesback uphill
 and if you're a physicist that kind of makes some sense you're building up somemomentum
 and that is kind of the right intuition but that that intuition is not enough tounderstand kind of how to do it and why
 it works um but it does it achieves one over ksquared
 and uh it has a mathematical structure and it's still kind ofto this day a lot of us are writing
 papers and trying to explore that and understand itum so there are lots of cool ideas in
 optimization but just kind of using gradients i think is number one thatgoes back you know
 150 years um and then nest drive i think has made a major contribution with thisidea so like you said gradients


1:18:44
Speaker 1 :themselves are
 in some sense mysterious yeah they're not uhthey're not as trivial as they're not as


1:18:50
Speaker 0 :trivial coordinate descent
 is more of a trivial one you just pick one of the coordinates that's how wethink


1:18:56
Speaker 1 :that's our human mind that's our human


1:18:57
Speaker 0 :minds think and gradients are not
 that easy for our human mind to grapple with

1:19:03
Speaker 1 :an absurd question but uh what is
 statistics

1:19:07
Speaker 0 :so the here it's a little bit it's
 somewhere between math and science and technology it's somewhere in that convexhole so it's a
 set of principles that allow you to make inferences that have got some reason tobe believed
 and also principles allow you make decisions where you canhave some reason to believe you're not
 going to make errors so all of that requires some assumptions about what doyou mean by an error what do you mean by
 you know the probabilities and um but you know you start after you startmaking some of those assumptions you're
 led to uh conclusions that yes i can guaranteethat you know
 you know if you do this in this way your probability of making error will besmall
 your probability of continuing to not make errors over time will be smalland probability you found something
 that's real will be small uh will be high so decision making

1:19:53
Speaker 1 :is a big part


1:19:54
Speaker 0 :of the big part yeah so uh the original
 so statistics uh you know short history was that you know it's kind of goes backas a formal discipline you know 250
 years or so it was called inverse probability because around that eraprobability was developed sort of
 especially to explain gambling situations of course and um interestingso you would say well given the state of
 nature is this there's a certain roulette board that has a certainmechanism in it
 uh what kind of outcomes do i expect to see uh andum especially if i do things long long
 amounts of time what outcomes i see and the physicists start to pay attention tothis
 um and then people say well given let's turn the problem around what if isaw certain outcomes could i infer what
 the underlying mechanism was that's an inverse problem and in factfor quite a while statistics was called
 inverse probability that was the name of the field and ibelieve
 that uh it was laplace uh who was working in napoleon's government who wastrying to who needed to do a census of
 france learn about the people there so he went and gathered dataand he analyzed that data to determine
 policy and uh said let's call this field that doesthis kind of thing statistics because
 um the the word state is in there in french that's etabut you know it's the study of data for
 the state so anyway that caught on and um it'sbeen called statistics ever since but um
 uh but by the time it got formalized it was sort of in the 30sum and uh around that time there was
 game theory and decision theory developednearby people in that era didn't think
 of themselves as either computer science or statistics or controlled or econ theywere all
 they were all the above and so you know von neumann is developing game theorybut also
 thinking of that as decision theory wall is an econometriciandeveloping decision theory and then you
 know turning that into statistics and so it's all about here's a here'snot just data and you analyze it here's
 a loss function here's what you care about here's the question you're tryingto ask
 here is a probability model and here's the risk you will faceif you make certain decisions um and
 to this day in most advanced statistical curricula you teach decision theory isthe starting point
 and then it branches out into the two branches of bazin or frequentist but umthat's it's all about decisions in


1:22:11
Speaker 1 :statistics
 what is the most beautiful mysterious maybe surprising idea thatyou've come across


1:22:21
Speaker 0 :uh yeah good question um
 i mean there's a bunch of surprising ones there's something that's way tootechnical for this thing but something
 called james stein estimation which is kind of surprisingand really takes time to wrap your head
 around can you try to maybe i think i don't even want to try um letme just say a colleague
 at steve steven stickler at university of chicago wrote a really beautifulpaper on james stein estimation which
 helps to its views of paradox it kind of defeats the mind's attempts tounderstand it but
 you can and steve has a nice perspective on thatum there uh so one of the troubles with
 statistics is that it's like in physics that are in quantum physics you havemultiple interpretations there's a wave
 and particle duality in physics and you get used to that over time but itstill kind of haunts you that you don't
 really you know quite understand therelationship the electrons away when
 electrons a particle well um well the same thing happens herethere's bayesian ways of thinking and
 frequentist and they are different they they all they sometimes become sortof the same in practice
 but they are physically different and then in some practice they are not thesame at all they give you rather
 different answers um and so it is very much like wave andparticle duality and that is something
 you have to kind of get used to in the fieldcan you define beijing and frequencies


1:23:36
Speaker 1 :yeah in decision theory you can make


1:23:38
Speaker 0 :i have a like i have a video that people
 could see it's called are you a bayesian or a frequentist and kind of helptry to to make it really clear it comes
 from decision theory so you know decision theoryuh you're talking about loss functions
 which are a function of data x and parameter theta it's afunction of two arguments
 okay neither one of those arguments is known you don't know the data a prioriit's random and the parameter is unknown
 all right so you have this function of two things you don't know and you'retrying to say i want that function to be
 small i want small loss right well um what are you gonna do soyou sort of say well i'm gonna average
 over these quantities or maximize over them or something sothat you know
 i turn that uncertainty into something certainso you could look at the first argument
 an average over it or you could look at the second argument average over itthat's bayesian frequencies so
 the frequencies says i'm going to look at the x the dataand i'm going to take that as random and
 i'm going to average over the distribution so i take the expectationloss
 under x theta is held fixed all right that's called the risk and soit's looking at other all the data sets
 you could get all right and say how well will acertain procedure do under all those
 data sets that's called a frequency guarantee allright so i think it is very appropriate
 when like you're building a piece of software and you're shipping it outthere and people are using all kinds of
 data sets you want to have a stamp a guarantee onit that as people run it on many many
 data sets that you never even thought about that95 of the time it will do the right
 thing um perfectly reasonable the bayesian perspective says well noi'm going to look at the other argument
 of the loss function the theta part okay that's unknown and i'm uncertainabout it so i could have
 my own personal probability for what it is you know how many tall people arethere out there i'm trying to infer the
 average height of the population well i have an idea roughly what the height isso i'm going to average over the um
 the theta so now that loss function has only now again one argument's gonenow it's a function of x and that's what
 a bayesian does is they say well let's just focus on the particular x wegot the data set we got we condition on
 that conditional on the x i say somethingabout my loss
 that's a bayesian approach to things and the bayesianwill argue that it's not relevant to
 look at all the other data sets you could have gottenand average over them the frequentest
 approach it's really only the data set you got all right andi do agree with that
 especially in situations where you're working with a scientist you can learn alot about the domain
 and you really only focus on certain kinds of data and you've gathered yourdata and you make inferences
 i don't agree with it though that it you know in the sense that there areneeds for frequency guarantees you're
 writing software people are using it out there you want to say something so thesetwo things have to go out to fight each
 other a little bit but they have to blendso long story short there's a set of
 ideas that are right in the middle they're called empirical baysand empirical base sort of starts with
 the bayesian framework it's it's kind of arguablyphilosophically more
 you know reasonable and kosher write down a bunch of the math that kind offlows from that
 and then realize there's a bunch of things you don't know because it's thereal world then you don't
 know everything so you're uncertain about certain quantities at that pointask is there a reasonable way to plug in
 an estimate for those things okay and in some cases there's quite areasonable thing to do
 to plug in there's a natural thing you can observe in the world that you canplug in
 and then do a little bit more mathematics and assure yourself it'sreally good


1:27:06
Speaker 1 :so my math are based on human expertise
 what's

1:27:09
Speaker 0 :what are good they're both going in the
 bayesian framework allows you to put a lot of human expertise inbut the math kind of guides you along
 that path and then kind of reassures you at the end you could put that stamp ofapproval under certain assumptions
 this thing will work so perhaps you asked question what's my favorite youknow or what's the most surprising nice
 idea so one that is more accessible is somethingcalled false discovery rate
 which is um you know you're making not just one hypothesis test or making onedecision you're making a whole bag of
 them and in that bag of decisions you look atthe ones where you made a discovery you
 announced that something interesting it happenedall right that's gonna be some subset of
 your big bag in the ones you made a discovery whichsubset of those are bad
 there are false false discoveries you like the fraction of your falsediscoveries among your discoveries to be
 small that's a different criterion thanaccuracy or precision or recall or
 sensitivity and specificity it's it's a different quantitythose latter ones are almost all of them
 um have more of a frequencies flavor theysay given the truth
 is that the null hypothesis is true here's what accuracy i would getor given that the alternative is true
 here's what i would get so it's kind of going forward from the state of natureto the data the bayesian goes the other
 direction from the data back to the state of natureand that's actually what false discovery
 rate is it says given you made a discoveryokay that's condition on your data
 what's the probability of the hypothesis it's going the other direction and so umthe classical frequency look at that so
 i can't know that there's some priors needed in thatand the empirical bayesian goes ahead
 and plows forward and starts writing downthese formulas and realizes at some
 point some of those things can actually be estimated in a reasonable way ohand so it's kind of it's a beautiful set
 of ideas so i i this kind of line of argument has come outit's not certainly mine but it it sort
 of came out from robin's around 1960. uh brad ephron haswritten beautifully about this in
 various papers and books and uh and the fdr is you know ben yaminiin israel um john storey did this
 bayesian interpretation and so on so i've just absorbed thesethings over the years and find it a very
 healthy way to think about statistics let me ask you about

1:29:20
Speaker 1 :intelligence to jump slightly back out
 into philosophy perhaps you said that uh maybe you can elaborate but uh yousaid that defining just even the
 question of what is intelligence is a word is as a very difficult question isthat a useful question
 do you think we'll one day understand the fundamentals of human intelligenceand what it means
 you know have good uh benchmarks for general intelligence that we put beforeour machines


1:29:53
Speaker 0 :so i don't work on these topics so much
 you're really asking a question for a psychologist really and i juststudied some but i don't consider myself
 at least an expert at this point you know a psychologist aims to understandhuman intelligence right and i think
 many psychologists i know are fairly humble about thisthey they might try and understand how a
 baby understands you know whether something's a solid or liquid oruh whether something's hidden or not and
 um maybe how you know a child starts tolearn the meaning of certain words
 what's a verb what's a noun and also you knowslowly but surely trying to figure out
 things um but human's ability to take a reallycomplicated environment reason about it
 abstract about it find the right abstractions communicate about itinteract and so on is just you know
 really staggeringly rich and complicatedum and so you know i think in all
 humidity we don't think we're kind of aiming for that inthe near future certainly psychologists
 doing experiments with babies in the lab or with people talking is ishas a much more limited aspiration and
 you know conor mcversky would look at our reasoning patterns and they'rethey're not deeply understanding
 all the how we do our reasoning but they're sort of saying here's somehere's some oddities about the reasoning
 and some things you should you need to think about it but also i as i emphasizeand things
 some things i've been writing about um you know ai the revolution hasn'thappened yet
 yeah um great blog post i've i've been emphasizing thatyou know if you step back and look at uh
 intelligent systems of any kind whatever you mean by intelligence it'snot just the humans or the animals or
 you know the plants or whatever you know so a market that brings goods into acity you know food to restaurants or
 something every day uh is a system it's a decentralized setof decisions
 looking at it from far enough away it's just like a collection of neuronseveryone every neuron is making its own
 little decisions presumably in some way and ifyou step back enough
 every little part of an economic system is making us all of its decisionsand just like with the brain who knows
 what the individual neuron doesn't know what the overall goal isright but something happens at some
 aggregate level same thing with the economypeople eat in a city and it's robust it
 works at all scales small villages to big citiesit's been working for thousands of years
 uh it works rain or shine so it's adaptiveum so all kind of you know those are
 adjeeves one tends to apply to intelligent systems robustadaptive you know you don't need to keep
 adjusting it it's self self healing whatever plus not perfect you knowintelligences are never perfect and
 markets are not perfect um but i do not believe in this areathat you cannot that you can say well
 our computers our humans are smart but you knowno markets are not more markets are so
 they are intelligent uh now um we humans didn't evolve to bemarkets we've been participating in them
 right but we are not ourselves a market per seum the neurons could be viewed as the


1:32:44
Speaker 1 :market you can't


1:32:45
Speaker 0 :there's economic you know neuroscience
 kind of perspectives that's interesting topursue all that the point though is is
 that if you were to study humans and really bethe world's best psychologist study for
 thousands of years and come up with the theory of human intelligence you mighthave never discovered
 principles of markets you know spy demand curves andyou know matching and auctions and all
 that uh those are real principles and they lead to a form of intelligencethat's not
 maybe human intelligence it's arguably another kind of intelligencethere probably are third kinds of
 intelligence or fourth that none of us are really thinking too much about rightnow
 so if you really and then all those are relevant to computer systemsin the future certainly the market one
 is relevant right now whereas understand human intelligence isnot so clear that it's relevant right
 now probably not um so if you want general intelligencewhatever one means by that or you know
 understand the intelligence in a deep sense and all that it is definitelyhas to be not just human intelligence
 it's got to be this broader thing and that's not a mystery markets areintelligent so you know
 it's definitely not just a philosophical stance to say we gotta move beyond andtell who intelligence that sounds
 ridiculous yeah but it's not and in that blog post

1:33:48
Speaker 1 :you define different kinds of like
 intelligent infrastructure iii which i really like that's some of the conceptyou've just been
 describing do you see ourselves if we see earthhuman civilization is a single organism
 do you think the intelligence of that organismwhen you think from the perspective of
 markets and intelligence infrastructure isincreasing is it increasing linearly is
 it increasing exponentially what do you think the future of thatintelligence i don't know i don't tend


1:34:16
Speaker 0 :to think i don't
 tend to answer questions like that because you know that's science fictionhoping to catch you off guard


1:34:25
Speaker 1 :well again because you said it's so far
 in the future it's fun to ask and you'll probablyyou know like you said predicting the
 future is really nearly impossible but sayas an axiom one day we create
 a human level superhuman level intelligent not the scale of markets butthe scale of an
 individual what do you think is is what do you think it would take to dothat or maybe to ask another question
 is how would that system be different than the biological human beings that wesee
 around us today is it possible to say anything interesting to that question oris it just a stupid question


1:35:05
Speaker 0 :it's not stupid question but it's
 science fiction science fiction and so i'm totally happy to read sciencefiction and think about it from time my
 own life i loved there was this like brain in avat kind of you know little thing that
 people were talking about when i was a student i rememberyou know imagine that uh um you know
 between your brain and your body there's youknow there's a bunch of wires right
 and suppose that every one of them was replaced with a uhuh literal wire and then suppose that
 wire was turning actually a little wirelessyou know there's a receiver and sender
 so the brain has got all the senders and receiver you know on all ofits exiting uh
 you know axons and all the dendrites down the body havereplaced with syndrome receivers now you
 could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vatright and then you could do things like
 start killing off those centers of receivers one by oneand after you've killed off all of them
 where is that person you know they thought they were out in the bodywalking around the world and they moved
 on so those are science fiction things those are fun to think about it's justintriguing about where's what is thought
 where is it and all that and i think every 18 year old it's totake philosophy classes and think about
 these things and i think that everyone should thinkabout what could happen in society
 that's kind of bad and all that but i really don't think that's the rightthing for most of us that are my age
 group to be doing and thinking about i really think that we have so many morepresent
 you know first challenges and dangers andreal things to build and all that um
 such that uh you know uh spending too much time onscience fiction at least in public fora
 like this i think is is not what we should be doing maybe over

1:36:36
Speaker 1 :beers in private that's right


1:36:38
Speaker 0 :i'm well welcome welcome i'm not gonna
 broadcast where i have beers because this is gonna go on facebooka lot of people showing up there but um
 yeah i'll uh i love facebook twitter amazon

1:36:50
Speaker 1 :youtube i have i'm optimistic and
 hopeful but uh maybe maybe i don't have groundsfor such optimism and hope


1:36:59
Speaker 0 :

1:37:01
Speaker 1 :let me ask term you've mentored
 some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figures in the fieldcan you uh give advice
 to people who undergraduates today what does it take to takeyou know advice on their journey if
 they're interested in machine learning and ai in inthe ideas of markets from economics and
 psychology and all the kinds of things that you're exploringwhat what what steps should they take on
 that journey well yeah first of all the

1:37:28
Speaker 0 :door is open and second it's a journey i
 like your language there uh it is not that you're so brilliantand you have great brilliant ideas and
 therefore that's that's just you know that's how you have success orthat's how you enter into the field
 uh it's that you apprentice yourself you you spend a lot of time you work on hardthings you
 try and pull back and you be as broad as you can you talk lots of peopleum and it's like entering any kind of a
 creative community there's um years that are neededand uh human connections are critical to
 it so you know i think about you know being a musician or being anartist or something you don't just
 you know immediately from day one you know you you're a genius and thereforeyou do it no you
 um you know practice really really hard on basicsand you uh be humble about where you are
 and then and you realize you'll never be an expert on everything so you kind ofpick and there's a lot of randomness and
 a lot of kind of luck but luck just kind of picks outwhich
 branch of the tree go down but you'll go down some branch umso yeah it's it's a community so the
 graduate school is i still think is one of the wonderfulphenomena that we have in our in our
 world it's it's very much about apprenticeship with an advisor it's verymuch about a group of people you belong
 to it's a four or five year process so it'splenty of time to start from kind of
 nothing to come up to something you know more expertise and then start to haveyour own creativity start to flower even
 surprise into your own self um and it's a very cooperative endeavor it's i thinka lot of people uh think of
 science as highly competitive and i think in some other fields it might bemore so
 here it's way more cooperative than you might imagineand people are always teaching each
 other something and people are always more than happy touh be clear that so i i feel i'm an
 expert on certain kind of things but i'm very much not expert on lots ofother things and a lot of them are
 relevant and a lot of them are i should know butit should in some sense i you know
 you don't so um i'm always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around meso they can teach me things
 and uh i think a lot of us feel that way about our field so it's very cooperativeuh i might add it's also very
 international because it's so cooperative we see no barriersand uh so that the nationalism that you
 see especially in the current era and everything is justat odds with the way that most of us
 think about what we're doing here where this is a human endeavor and we wecooperate and
 are very much trying to do it together for the you knowthe benefit of everybody so last


1:39:57
Speaker 1 :question
 where and how and why did you learn frenchand which language is more beautiful
 english or french

1:40:04
Speaker 0 :um great question so um first of all i
 think italian's actually more beautiful than french and english and i also speakthat so i'm i'm
 i'm married to an italian and i have kids and we speak italianum anyway though all kidding aside that
 every language allows you to express things a bit differently umand it is one of the great fun things to
 do in life is to explore those things so in fact when i kids or you know teens oruh college students ask me what they
 just study i say well do what your heartwhere your heart is certainly do a lot
 of math math is good for everybody but do some poetry and do some historyand do some language too
 um you know throughout your life you'll want to be a thinking person you'llwant to have done that um for me
 uh yeah french i learned when i was i'd saya late teen um i was living in the
 middle of the country in kansas and uh not much was going onin kansas with all due respect to kansas
 but uh and so my parents happen to have somefrench books on the shelf and just in my
 boredom i pulled them down and i found this is funand i kind of learned the language by
 reading and when i first heard it spoken i hadno idea what was being spoken but i
 realized i somehow knew it from some previous lifeand so i made the connection
 um but then you know i traveled and just i i love to go beyond my own barriersand uh
 my own comfort or whatever and i found myself in you know on trains in francenext to
 say older people who would you know live the whole life of their own andthe ability to communicate with them was
 was you know special and uh ability to also see myself inother people's shoes and have empathy
 and kind of work on that language as part of thatum so um so after
 that kind of experience um and also embedding myself in french culture whichis you know
 quite quite amazing you know languages are rich not just because there'ssomething
 inherently beautiful about it but it's all the creativity that went into it soi learned a lot of songs read poems read
 books um and then i was here actually at mitwhere we're doing the
 podcast today and uh young professor um you know not yet married and uhum you know not having a lot of friends
 in the area so i just didn't have i was getting kind of a bored person isaid i heard a lot of italians around
 there's happened to be a lot of italians at mitbehind professor for some reason and so
 i was kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about i said well ishould learn this language too so i
 i did and then later met my spouse and uhyou know wow italian became a more
 important part of my life but um but i go to china a lot these days i go toasia i go to europe and um every time i
 go i kind of uh i'm amazed by the richness of humanexperience and the the
 people don't have any idea if you haven't traveled kind of how i'm youknow amazingly rich and i love
 the diversity it's not just a buzzword to me it really means something i lovethe
 you know you know embed myself with other people's experiences and uh soyeah learning language is a big part of
 that i think i've said in some interview at some point that if i hadyou know millions of dollars on the
 infinite time whatever what would you really work on if you really wanted todo ai and for me that is natural
 language and really done right you know deepunderstanding of language
 um that's to me an amazingly interesting scientific challengeand uh when we're very far away one


1:43:14
Speaker 1 :

1:43:15
Speaker 0 :we're very far away but good natural
 language people are kind of really invested then i think a lot of them seethat's where the core of ai is that if
 you understand that you really help human communicationyou understand something about the human
 mind the semantics that come out of the human mindand i agree i think that will be such a
 long time so i didn't do that in my career just because i kind ofi was behind in the early days i didn't
 kind of know enough of that stuff i was at mit i didn't learn muchlanguage and it was too late at some
 point to kind of spend a whole career doing that but i admirethat field and uh
 um and so in my little way by learning languageyou know kind of that part of my brain
 has um has been trained up

1:43:55
Speaker 1 :jan was right you truly are the miles
 davis and machine learning i don't think there's a better place thanit was mike is a huge honor talking to

1:44:35
Speaker 1 :let me leave you with some words of
 wisdom from michael i jordan from his blog post titled artificialintelligence
 the revolution hasn't happened yet callingfor broadening the scope of the ai field


1:44:48
Speaker 0 :

1:44:48
Speaker 1 :we should embrace the fact that what we
 are witnessing is the creation of a new branch ofengineering the term engineering is
 often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtones ofcold
 effectless machinery and negative connotations of loss of control byhumans
 but an engineering discipline can be what we want it to bein the current era we have a real
 opportunity to conceive of something historically newa human-centric engineering discipline
 i'll resist giving this emerging discipline a name but if the acronym aicontinues to be used let's be aware of
 the very real limitations of this placeholderlet's broaden our scope tone down the
 hype and recognize the serious challengesahead


1:45:36
Speaker 0 :

1:45:37
Speaker 1 :thank you for listening and hope to see
