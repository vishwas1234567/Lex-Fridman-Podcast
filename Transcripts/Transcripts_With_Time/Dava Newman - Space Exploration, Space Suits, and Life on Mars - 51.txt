Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 David Newman she's the Apollo program professor at MIT and the former deputyadministrator of NASA and has been a
 principal investigator on for spaceflight missionsher research interests are an aerospace
 biomedical engineering investigating human performance in varying gravityenvironments she has designed and
 engineered and built some incredible spacesuit technology namely the biosuitthat we talk about in this conversation
 due to some scheduling challenges on both our parts we only had about 40minutes together and in true engineering
 style she said I talk fast you picked the best questions let's get it done andwe did it was a fascinating conversation
 about space exploration and the future of space suits this is the artificialintelligence podcast if you enjoy it

 globe on boat so let's look back in history 500 years ago FerdinandMagellan's crew was first to
 circumnavigate the globe but he died I think people don't know like halfwaythrough and so did 242 of the 260
 sailors that took that three-year journey what do you think it was likefor that crew at that time heading out
 into the unknown to face probably likely death do you think they were filled withfear with excitement


0:03:46
Speaker 1 :probably not fear I think in all of
 exploration is the challenge and the unknownso probably wonderment and then just the
 when you really are sailing the world's oceans you have extreme weather of allkinds when we were circumnavigating it
 was challenging a new dynamic you really appreciate Mother Earth you appreciatethe winds of the ways so back to
 Magellan his crew since they really didn't have you know a three-dimensionalof the globe of the earth when they went
 out just probably looking over the horizon thinking what's there what'sthere so I would say the challenge that
 had to be really important in terms of the team dynamics on that leadership hadto be incredibly important team dynamics
 too how do you keep people focused on the mission do you think the psychology

0:04:32
Speaker 0 :that's interesting that's probably
 echoes of that and the space exploration stuff we'll talk about so the psychologyof the dynamics between the human beings
 on the mission is important absolutely

0:04:43
Speaker 1 :for a Mars mission it's there's lots of
 challenges technology but you know since I specialize in keep my astronauts alivethe cycle social issues the psychology
 of a psychosocial Team Dynamics leadership that's you know we're allpeople so that's gonna be that's a he
 always a huge impact one of the top three I think of any isolated confinedenvironment it can any mission that is
 really pretty extreme so your twitter

0:05:07
Speaker 0 :handle is david explorer so when did you
 first fall in love with the idea of

0:05:14
Speaker 1 :exploration ah that's a great question
 maybe as long as I can remember as I grew up in Montana in the RockyMountains and Helena and the capital is
 so literally a mount Helen it was my backyard was right up there so exploringbeing in the mountains looking at caves
 just running around but always being in nature so since my earliest memories Iyou know think of myself is kind of
 exploring the natural beauty of the Rocky Mountains where I grew up so

0:05:43
Speaker 0 :exploration is not living at changing
 domain it's just anything so the natural domain of any kind but going out to thewoods into the place you haven't been
 it's all exploration I think so yeah I

0:05:52
Speaker 1 :have a pretty all-encompassing
 definition what about space exploration

0:05:56
Speaker 0 :when we first captivated by the idea
 that we little humans couldn't venture out into the space into the greatunknown enough space so it's a great


0:06:06
Speaker 1 :year to talk about that the 50th
 anniversary of Apollo 11s I was alive during Apollo and specifically Apollowhen I was 5 years old and I distinctly
 remember that I remembered that humanity I'm sure I probably didn't know theirnames at the time you know there's Neil
 Armstrong Buzz Aldrin and never forget Michael Collins in orbit no those threeman
 you know doing something that just seemed impossible seemed impossible adecade earlier even a year earlier but
 the Apollo program really inspired me and then I think it actually just taughtme to dream to any impossible mission
 could be possible with enough focus yeah I'm sure you need some luck but youdefinitely need the leadership you need
 the the focus of the mission so since an early age I thought of course peopleshould be interplanetary of course
 people we need people on earth and we're gonna have people exploring space as

0:07:00
Speaker 0 :well that seemed obvious you know at


0:07:03
Speaker 1 :that age it opened it up before we saw
 men on the moon it was not obvious to me at all but once we understood that yesabsolutely
 astronauts that's what they do they explore they go into space and they landon other planets or moons so again maybe


0:07:16
Speaker 0 :a romanticized philosophical question
 but when you look up at the stars knowing that you know there's at least ahundred billion of them in the Milky Way
 galaxy right so we're really a small speck in this giant thing that's thevisible universe how does that make you
 feel about our efforts here I love the

0:07:39
Speaker 1 :perspective I love that perspective I
 always opened my public talks with a big Hubble Space Telescope image looking outuntil you mentioned just now the solar
 system the Milky Way because I really think it's really important to know thatwe're just a small pill blue dot we're
 really fortunate we're on the best planet by far life is fantastic that weknow of you're confident this is the
 best planet that we know of I mean I searched my research as you know inmission worlds and when will we find
 life I think actually in probably the next decade we find probably past lifeprobably the evidence of past life on
 Mars let's say you think there was

0:08:14
Speaker 0 :pretty like once life on Mars or do you
 think there's currently I'm more

0:08:19
Speaker 1 :comfortable saying about 3.5 billion
 years ago feel pretty confident there was life on Mars just because then ithad an electromagnetic shield it had an
 atmosphere has wonderful gravity level three 3s jeez fantastic you know you'reall super human we can all slam dunk a
 basketball I mean it's gonna be fun to play sports on Mars but so I think we'llfind past that no fossilize probably the
 evidence of past life on Mars currently that's again we need the nextdecade but the evidence is mounting for
 sure we do have the organics we're finding organics we have water seasonalwater on Mars we used to just know about
 the ice caps you know north and south pole now we have seasonal water we dohave the building blocks for life on
 Mars we really need to dig down into the soil because everything on the topsurface is radiated but once we find
 down will we see any any life form so we see any bugsI leave it open as a possibility but I
 feel pretty certain that past life or you know fossilized life forms will findand then we have to get to all these
 ocean worlds these these beautiful moons of other other planets since we knowthey have water and we're looking for
 since simple search for life or follow the wateryou know carbon-based life that's the
 only life we know there could be other life forms that we don't know about butit was hard to search for them because
 we don't know so in our search for life in the solar system it's definitely youknow search you know let's follow the
 water and look for the building blocks

0:09:40
Speaker 0 :of life do you think in the next decade
 we might see hints of past life or even

0:09:45
Speaker 1 :currently I think so I'm pretty active


0:09:48
Speaker 0 :you humans have to be involved or can
 this be robots and Rovers and probably

0:09:52
Speaker 1 :teams I mean we've been at it on Mars in
 particularly 50 years we've been exploring Mars for 50 years great daythat right our images of Mars today are
 phenomenal now we know how Mars lost its atmosphere you know we're starting toknow because of the lack of the
 electromagnetic shield we know about the water in Mars so we've been studying 50years with our robots we still haven't
 found it so I think once we have a human mission there we just accelerate thingsit's always humans and our Rovers and
 robots together but we just have to think that 50 years we've been lookingat Mars Mars and taking images and doing
 the best science that we can people need to realise Mars this really far awayit's really hard to get to you know this
 is extreme extreme exploration we mentioned Magellan first or all of thewonderful explorers and sailors of the
 past which kind of are lots of my inspiration for exploration Mars is adifferent ballgame I mean no sir eight
 months to get there year and a half to get home I mean it's really extreme

0:10:45
Speaker 0 :environment in all kinds of ways but the
 kind of organism might be able to see himself on Mars or kind ofmicroorganisms perhaps


0:10:54
Speaker 1 :yeah I remember that humans were canal
 you know we're hosts right we're hosts all of our bacteria and viruses right do

0:11:01
Speaker 0 :you think it's a big leap from the
 viruses in the bacteria to us humans put another way do you think on allthose moons beautiful wet moons that you
 mentioned you think there's intelligent life out there I hope so I mean that's

0:11:15
Speaker 1 :that's the hope but you know we don't
 have the scientific evidence for that now I think all the evidence we have interms of life existing is much more
 compelling again because we have the building blocks of life now when thatlife turns into intelligence that's a


0:11:32
Speaker 0 :big unknown if we ever meet do you think
 we would be able to find a common

0:11:36
Speaker 1 :language I hope so we haven't met yet
 it's just so far I mean do physics just play a role here look at all theseexoplanets 6000 exoplanets I mean even
 the couple dozen earth-like planets or exoplanets that really look likehabitable planets these are very
 earth-like they look like they have all the building blocks I can't wait to getthere the only thing is they're 10 to
 100 light years away so scientifically we know they're there we know thatthey're habitable they have you know
 everything going from right you know we call the Goldilocks zone not too hot nottoo cold just perfect for how
 habitability for life but now the reality is if they're ten at the best toa hundred to thousands of light-years
 away so what's out there but I just can'tthink that we're not the only ones so
 absolutely life life in the universe probably intelligent life as well do you

0:12:25
Speaker 0 :think there needs to be fundamental
 revolutions and how we the tools we use to travel through space in order for usto venture outside of our solar system
 or do you think the the ways the Rockets the ideas we have now the engineeringideas we have now will be enough to


0:12:42
Speaker 1 :venture out well it's a good question
 right now yokas can speed of light is it is it isthe limit we don't have a warp speed
 warp drive to explore our solar system to get to Mars to explore all theplanets then we need a technology push
 but technology push here is just advanced propulsion would be great Icould get humans to Mars and say you
 know three to four months not eight months I mean have the time 50%reduction that's great in terms of
 safety and wellness of the orbital my County but physics rules inorbital mechanics we can't defy physics
 I love that so the new physics I mean look at quantum you know look at quantumtheories so you never know exactly I
 mean we are always learning so we definitely don't know all the physicsthat exists too but where we still have
 to it's not science fiction you know we still have to pay attention to physicsin terms of our speed of travel for


0:13:32
Speaker 0 :space flight so you were the deputy
 administrator of NASA during the Obama administration there's a current Artemisprogram that's what kind of cooed
 mission to the moon and then perhaps the Mars what are you excited about therewhat are your thoughts on this program
 what are the biggest challenges do you think of getting to the moon of landingto the moon once again and then the big


0:13:56
Speaker 1 :step to Mars well I love you know the
 moon program now Artemis we it is definitely we've been in low-earth orbitI love low Earth orbit too but I just
 always look at those three phases so Laura Thoren where we've been 40 yearsso definitely time to get back to deep
 space time to get to the moon there's so much to do on the moon I hope we don'tget stuck on the moon for 50 years I
 really want to get to the moon spent the next decade first with the lander thenhumans there's just a lot to explore but
 to me is a big technology push it's only three days away so the moon isdefinitely the right place so we kind of
 buy down our technology we invest in specifically habitats life supportsystems so we need suits we really need
 to understand really how to live off planet we've been off planet and lowEarth orbit but still that's only you
 know 400 kilometers up 20 or 50 miles right so we get to the moon is really isa great proving ground for the
 technologies and now we're in deep space radiation becomes a huge issue can tokeep our astronauts well alive and I
 look at all of that investment for moon moon exploration to the ultimate goalyou know the horizon goals we call it to
 get people to Mars but we just don't go to Mars tomorrowright we really need a decade on the
 moon I think investing in the technologies learning making sure theastronauts are their health you know
 they're safe and well and also learning so much institute research you knowutilization is are you in situ resource
 utilization is huge when it comes to exploration for the moonand Marceau was need a testbed and to me
 it really is a lunar testbed and then we use those same investments to thinkabout getting people to Mars in the
 2030s so developing sort of a platform

0:15:33
Speaker 0 :of all the kind of research tools of all
 the what's the resource you know the can

0:15:39
Speaker 1 :you speak to that yeah so is are you for
 the moon it's will go to the South Pole and fascinating we have images of it ofcourse we know there's permanently
 shaded areas and Shackleton crater and there's areas that are permanently inthe Sun well it seems that there's a lot
 of water ice you know water that's in trapped in ice and the lunar cratersthat's the first place you go why
 because it's water and when you want to try to it could be fuel you knowlife-support systems so you kind of get
 in you go where the water is and so when the moon is kind of for resourcesutilization but to learn how to it can
 we make the fuels out of the resources that are on the moon we have to thinkabout 3d printing right you don't get to
 bring all this mass with you you have to learn how to literally live off the landwe need a pressure shell we need to have
 an atmosphere for people to to live in so all of that is going to bind down thetechnology doing the investigation doing
 the science what are the basically the lunar volatiles you know what is thatice on the moon how much of it is there
 what are the resources look like to me that helps us that's just the next stepin getting humans to Mars and it's


0:16:46
Speaker 0 :cheaper and more effective to sort of
 develop some of these difficult challenges like solve some of thesechallenges practice develop test and so
 on on the moon

0:16:54
Speaker 1 :absolutely so Mars absolutely people are
 gonna love to get to the moon you get to you have a beautiful earth rise I meanyou have the most magnificent view of
 Earth being off planet so it just makes sense I think we're gonna have thousandslots of people hopefully tens of
 thousands in low-earth orbit because Laura Thoren it's a beautiful place togo and look down on the earth but people
 want to return home I think that the lunar explorers will also want to doround trips and you know beyond beyond
 the moon three-day trip explore do science also because the lunar day is 14days in a lunar Nights also 14 days so
 in that 28-day cycle half of it is in light half of us in dark so people wouldprobably want to do you know a couple
 week trips month long trips not longer than that

0:17:35
Speaker 0 :what I mean by people what do you think


0:17:36
Speaker 1 :explorers yeah astronauts are gonna be
 civilians in the future too not all not all astronauts are gonna be governmentastronauts actually when I was at NASA
 we changed we actually got the law changed to recognize astronauts that arenot only government employees you know
 NASA astronauts or European Space Agency astronaut or Russian space agency thatastronauts because of the big push we
 put in the private sector that astronauts essentially you're gonna beastronauts you get over a hundred
 kilometres up and I think once you've done orbital orbital flight then you'rean astronaut so a lot of private
 citizens are going to become astronauts

0:18:10
Speaker 0 :do you think one day you might step foot


0:18:14
Speaker 1 :on the moon Mars I'm gonna it's my
 life's work to get the next generation to Mars that's that's that's you areeven younger than you you know my
 students generation yes will be the Martian explorersI'm just working to facilitate that but
 that's not gonna be me

0:18:30
Speaker 0 :hey the moon is pretty good and it's a
 lot tough I mean it's still a really

0:18:35
Speaker 1 :tough mission it is an extreme mission
 exactly it's great for exploration but doable but again before Apollo we didn'tthink getting humans to the moon was
 even possible so we kind of made that possible but we need to go back weabsolutely need to go back we're
 investing in the heavy lift launch capabilities that we need to get therewe haven't had that you know since the
 Apollo days since since Saturn five so now we have three options on the boardthat's what's so fantastic NASA has its
 you know Space Launch System SpaceX is gonna have its it's heavy capability andBlue Origin is coming along too with
 heavy lifts so that's pretty fantastic from where I said I'm the Apollo programprofessor today I have zero heavy lift
 launch capability I can't wait just in a few years we'llhave three different heavy lift launch
 capabilities so that's pretty exciting

0:19:17
Speaker 0 :you know your heart is perhaps with NASA
 but you mentioned SpaceX and Blue Origin what are your what are your thoughts ofSpaceX and the innovative efforts
 they're from the sort of private company aspect oh they're great they're mine

0:19:31
Speaker 1 :remember that the investments in SpaceX
 is government funding it's NASA funding is US Air Force funding just as itshould be because you're bettin on a
 company who is moving fast has some new technology development so I love it sowhen as
 it really was under our public-private partnerships so necessarily thegovernment needs to fund these these
 startups now SpaceX is no longer a start-up but you know it's been at itfor for ten years this has some axis
 learned a lot of lessons but it's great because it's the way you move faster andalso some private industry folks and
 businesses will take a lot more risk that's also really important for thegovernment what do you think about that


0:20:11
Speaker 0 :culture of risk I mean sort of NASA and
 the government are exceptionally good at delivering sort of safe like there's alittle bit more of a culture of caution
 and safety and sort of this kind of solid engineering and I think SpaceXwall has the same kind of stuff it has a
 little bit more of that startup feel where they take the bigger risk is thatexciting for you to see seeing bigger


0:20:33
Speaker 1 :risks in this case absolutely and the
 best scenario is both of them working together because there's reallyimportant lessons learned especially
 when you talk about human spaceflight safety quality assurance these thingsare the utmost importance but both
 aviation and space you know when human lives are at stake on the other handgovernment agencies NASA it can be
 European Space Agency you name it they become very bureaucratic prettyrisk-averse move pretty slowly so I
 think the best is when you you combine the partnerships from both sidesindustry necessarily has to push the
 government take some more risks you know I got me they're smart risk or actuallygave an award at NASA for failing smart


0:21:11
Speaker 0 :I love that you've seen kind of break up


0:21:12
Speaker 1 :when the cultures say no that they don't
 look Apollo that was a huge risk it was done well yeah so there's always aculture of safety quality assurance you
 know engineering you know edit at its best but on the other hand you want toget things done and you have to also get
 them you have to bring the cost down you know for when it comes to launch wereally have to bring the cost down and
 get the frequency up and so that's what the newcomers are doing they're reallypushing that so it's about the most
 exciting time I can imagine for for spaceflight again a little bit it reallyis the democratization of spaceflight
 opening it up not just because the launch capability but the science we cando on a CubeSat what you can do now for
 very those used to be you know student projects that we would go throughconceive design implement and think
 about what a small satellite would be now they're the most you know there's areally advanced instrument science
 instruments are flying on little team cube sets that pretty much anyone canafford so there's not a there's every
 nation you know every place in the world can fly a cube set and so that's cubeset Oh CubeSat is a this is called one
 YouYube says we measure in terms of units so you know just in terms of I putmy both my hands together that's one
 unit two units trees so little small satellites so cube sets are for smallsatellites and we actually go by mass as
 well you know small satellite might be 100 kilos 200 kilos all well under athousand kilos cube sets then our the
 next thing down from small sets you know basically you know kilos a tens of kilosthings like that but kind of the
 building blocks cube sets are fantastic designs kind of modular design so I cantake a1 u1 1 unit of CubeSat and you
 know but what if I have a little bit more money and payload I can fly threeof them and just basically put a lot
 more instruments on it but essentially think about something the size of ashoebox if you will you know that would
 be a cube set and those how do those

0:22:59
Speaker 0 :help empower you in terms of doing size
 doing exponents

0:23:03
Speaker 1 :oh right now there's getting back to
 private industry planet the company is you know flying cube sets and literallylooking down on earth and orbiting or
 taking a picture if you will of Earth every day every 24 hours covering theentire Earth so terms of earth
 observations in terms of climate change in terms of our changing earthit's revolutionising because they're
 affordable we can put a whole bunch of them up the telecoms we're all you knowon our cell phones and GPS we have our
 telecoms but those used to be very expensive satellites providing thatservice now we can fly a whole bunch of
 modular cube sets so it really is breakthrough in terms of modularity aswell as cost reduction so so that's one


0:23:44
Speaker 0 :exciting set of developments is there
 something else that you've been excited about and like reusable rockets perhapsthat you've seen in the last few years


0:23:54
Speaker 1 :yeah well the reusability you had your
 usability is awesome I mean is the best now we have to remember the shuttle wasa reusable vehicle yes which an shuttle
 is an amazing aerospace engineer I mean the shuttle is still just the mostgorgeous elegant extraordinary design of
 a space vehicle it was reusable it just wasn'taffordable
 but the reusability of it was really critical because we flew it up it didcome back so the notion of usability and
 I think absolutely now what we're doing with we you know a global we but withSpaceX of origin sitting the Rockets up
 recovering the first stages where if they can regain seventy percent costsavings that's huge and just seeing the
 control you know the convenient control anddynamics person is just seeing that
 rocket come back and land oh yeah that's it never gets old it's exciting so it'sso cool give me the landing is when I


0:24:48
Speaker 0 :stand up start clapping he's just just


0:24:52
Speaker 1 :the control control I go and hit that
 landing it's you know it's gymnastics for for a rocket ships better see theseguys stick a landing or foot it's just
 wonderful so every time like I said every time I see ya the reusability andthe rockets coming back and landing so
 precisely it's really exciting so it is it is actually that's a game-changer weare in a new era of lower costs and a
 lot the higher frequency and it's the world not just NASA it's many nationsare really upping their frequency of
 launches you've done a lot of exciting

0:25:23
Speaker 0 :research design engineering on
 spacesuits what does the spacesuit of

0:25:32
Speaker 1 :the future look like very tight fitting
 suit we use them a chemical counter pressure to pressurize right directly onthe skin seems that it's technically
 feasible we're still at the research and development stage we don't have a flightsystem but technically is feasible so we
 do a lot of work in the materials you know what materials do we need topressurize someone what's the patterning
 we need that's what our patents are in the patterning kind of how we apply thisis a third of an atmosphere just to sort


0:25:57
Speaker 0 :of take a step back you have this
 incredible bio suit wear them it's tight fitting so it allows more mobility andso on so maybe even to take a bigger
 step back like what are the functions that a space it should perform here so

0:26:10
Speaker 1 :start from the beginning a spacesuit is
 the world's smallest spacecraft so I really that's the best definition I cangive you right now we fly gas
 pressurized suits but think of developing and designing an entirespacecraft so then you take all those
 systems and you shrink them around a person provide them with oxygen tobreathe scrub out their carbon
 I know make sure they have pressure they need a pressure environment to live onso really a spacesuit is a shrunken you
 know spacecraft in its entirety has communications exactly so you reallythermal control a little bit of
 radiation not so much radiation protection but thermal control humidityyou know oxygen breeze so all those life
 support systems as well as the pressure production so it's an engineering marvelyou know the spacesuits that have flown
 because they really are entire spacecraft that a small spacecraft thatwe have around a person but they're very
 massive but 140 kilo is the current suit and they're not mobility suits so sincewe're going back to the Moon and Mars we
 need a planetary suit we need a mobility suit so that's where we've kind offlipped the design paradigm I study
 astronauts I study humans in motion and if we can map that motion I want to giveyou a full flexibility you know move
 your arms and legs I really want you to be like a Olympic athlete in extremeExplorer I don't want to waste any of
 your energy so we take it from the human design so I take a look at humans wemeasure them we model them and then I
 say okay can I put a spacesuit on them that goes from the skin out so ratherthan a gas pressurized shrinking that
 spacecraft around the person so here's how humans perform can I design aspacesuit literally from the skin out
 that's what we've come up with mechanical counter-pressure somepatterning and that way it could be
 order of magnitude less in terms of the mass and it should provide maximummobility for moon or mars


0:27:54
Speaker 0 :what's mechanical cano pressure like how
 the heck can you even begin to create something that's tight-fitting so andstill doesn't protect you from the
 elements and so on and the hold of the

0:28:07
Speaker 1 :pressure thing design channels we've
 been working on it from so you can either put someone in a balloon that'sone way to do it that's conventional
 that's me that means the balloon doesn't get fresher eyes soon so put someone ina blue it's only a third of an
 atmosphere to keep someone alive so that's what the current system is sodepending on what units you think in 30
 kilo Pascal's you know 4.3 pounds per

0:28:25
Speaker 0 :square so much less than the the
 pressure that's on earth you can still be a human alive with 0.3 and it's alive

0:28:33
Speaker 1 :and happy alive in half India you mix
 the gases you need here we're we're having this chat and we're both we're atone sea level in Boston it you know one
 atmosphere but assume

0:28:42
Speaker 0 :nitrogen arsenide you didn't you put a


0:28:43
Speaker 1 :suit if we put someone to a third of an
 atmosphere so for mechanical counter pressure now so one ways to do it with aballoon and that's what we currently
 have or you can apply the pressure directly to the skin I only have to giveyou a third of an atmosphere right now
 you and I are very happy in one atmosphere so so you know we can so if Iput that pressure a third of an
 atmosphere on you I just have to do it consistently you know across you knowall of your body and your limbs and
 it'll be a gas pressurized helmet doesn't make sense to shrink wrap thehead we don't need to there's no
 benefits of like shrink wrapping have you put on gas pressurized helmetbecause the helmet then the future of
 suits you asked me about the helmet just becomes your information portal yes sowe'll have augmented reality you'll have
 all the information you need should have you know the maps that I need I'm on themoon okay well hey smart helmet then
 show me the map show me the topography hopefully it has the lab embedded too ifit has really great cameras maybe I can
 see with that regolith that's just lunar dust and dirt what's that made ofwe talked about the water so the helmet
 then really becomes this information portal is how I see kind of the ITarchitecture the helmet is really
 allowing me to you know use all of my modalities of an explorer that I'd liketo so cameras voiceover images if it
 were really good it would kind of be would have lab capabilities as well okay

0:30:05
Speaker 0 :so the pressure comes for the body comes
 from the mechanical pressure just fascinatingnow what aspect when I look at BIOS they
 just the suits you're working on sort of from a fashion perspective they lookawesome is that is that a small part of


0:30:20
Speaker 1 :it too oh absolutely because the teams
 that we work with of course I'm an engineer there's engineering studentsthere's design students there's
 architects so it really is a very much a multidisciplinary team so sure colorsaesthetics materials all those things we
 pay attention to so it's not just an engineering solution it really is a muchmore holistic it's a suit it's a suit
 you're you know so we really have to pay attention to all those things and sothat's the design team that we work with
 and my partner get rowdy you know we were partners in this in terms of hecomes from an architect or industrial
 design background so bringing those skills to bear as wellwe team up with industry folks who are
 in athletic performance and designers so it really is a team that brings allthose skills together so what role does


0:31:06
Speaker 0 :the spacesuit play in our long-term
 staying in Mars sort of exploring the doing all the work that astronauts dobut also perhaps civilians one day
 almost like taking steps towards colonization of Mars what world is aspacesuit play there so you always need


0:31:22
Speaker 1 :life-support system
 pressurized habitat and I like to say we're not going to Mars to sit aroundyou know even if you land and have the
 lander you're not going there to stay inside that's for darn sure we're goingthere to search for the evidence of life
 that's why we're going to Mars so you need a lot of mobility so for me thesuit is the best way to give the human
 mobility we're always so gonna need Rovers we're gonna need robots so for meexploration is always a suite of
 explorers some people are gonna some of the suite of explorers or humans butmany are gonna be robots smart systems
 things like that but I look at it it's kind of all those capabilities togethermake the best exploration team so let me


0:32:01
Speaker 0 :ask I loved artificial intelligence and
 you thought I've also saw that you've enjoyed the movie space obviously 2001 aSpace Odyssey let me ask the question
 about Hal 9000 that makes a few decisions there that prioritizes themission over the the astronauts do you
 think from a high philosophical question do you think hell did the right thingprioritizing the mission I think our


0:32:25
Speaker 1 :artificial intelligence will be smarter
 in the future for a Mars mission it's a great question of is that the realityisn't for a Mars mission you know we
 need fully autonomous systems we will get humans but they have to be fullyautonomous and that's a really important
 concept because you know there's not going to be a Mission Control on earthyou know I'd you know 20-minute time leg
 there's just no way you're gonna control so fully a ton so people have to befully autonomous as well but all of our
 systems as well and so that's that's the big design challenge so that's why wetest them out on the moon as well when
 we have a okay a few seconds you know a three-second time leg you can test himout we have to really get autonomous
 exploration down you asked me earlier about Magellan and Magellan and his crewthey they left right they were
 autonomous mm-hmm you know they were autonomous they left and they were ontheir own to figure out that mission
 then when they hit land they have resources as Institue resourceutilization and everything else they
 brought with them so we have to I think have that mindset for expression againback to the moon it's more the testing
 ground the proving ground with technologies but when we get to Marsit's so far away that we need fully
 autonomous systems so I think that's that's where again AI and autonomy comein really robust autonomy things that we
 don't have today yet so they're on the drawing boards but we really need totest them out because that's that's what
 we're up against so fully autonomous

0:33:43
Speaker 0 :meaning like self-sufficient there's
 still a role for the human in that picture do you think there will be atime when AI systems just beyond doing
 fully autonomous flight control will also help or even take mission decisionslike how did that's interesting it


0:34:00
Speaker 1 :depends I mean they're gonna be designed
 by humans as you mentioned humans are always in the loop I mean we might be onearth we might be in orbit on Mars maybe
 the systems the Landers down on the surface of Mars but I think we're gonnaget we are right now just on earth-based
 systems you know AI systems that are incredibly capable and you know trainingthem with all the data that we have now
 you know petabytes of data from Earth what I care about for the autonomy andAI right now how we're applying it and
 research is to look at earth and look at climate systems I mean that's the it'snot for Mars to me today right now AI is
 to eyes on earth all of our space data compiling that using supercomputersbecause we have so much information and
 knowledge and we need to get that into people's hands we need first there's theeducational issue with climate and our
 changing climate then we need to change human behavior that's the biggie so thisnext decade it's urgent we take care of
 our own spaceship which is spaceship earth so that's to me where my focus hasbeen for AI systems using whatever is
 out there kind of imagining also what the future situation is the satelliteimagery of Earth of the future if you
 can hold that in your hands that's gonna be really powerful will that help peopleaccelerate positive change for Earth and
 for us to live in balance with earth I hope so and kind of start with the oceansystems so oceans to land to air and
 kind of using all the space data so it's a huge role for artificialtelogen to help us analyze I call it
 curating the data using the data it has a lot - of visualizations as as well do

0:35:31
Speaker 0 :you think and a weird dark question do
 you think human species can survive if we don't become interplanetary in thenext century or a couple of centuries


0:35:44
Speaker 1 :absolutely we can survive
 I don't think Mars is option B actually I think is all about saving spaceshipearth and humanity I simply put you know
 earth doesn't need us but we really need our you know allhumanity needs to live in balance with
 earth because earth has been here a long time before we ever showed up and it'llbe here a long time after it's just a
 matter of how do we want to live with all living beings you know much more inbalance because we need to take care of
 the earth and right now we're we're not so that's the urgency and I think it isthe next decade to try to live much more
 sustainably live more in balance with earth I think the human species has agreat long optimistic future but we have
 to act it's urgent we you know it we have to change behavior we we have towork we have to realize that we're all
 in this together it's just one blue bubble it's for Humanity so when I thinkpeople realize that we're all astronauts
 that's the great news is everyone's be an astronaut you birth we're all onwe're all astronauts of spaceship earth
 and okay this is our mission this is our mission to take care of the planet and

0:36:45
Speaker 0 :yet as we explore out from our from our
 spaceship earth here out into the space what do you think the next 50 hundred200 years look like for space


0:36:57
Speaker 1 :exploration I'm optimistic so I think
 that we'll have lots of people thousands of people tens of thousands people whoknows maybe millions in low-earth orbit
 that's just a place that we're gonna have people and actually some industrymanufacturing things like that that that
 dream I hope we realize getting people to the moon so I can envision a lot ofpeople on the moon again it's great
 place to living or visiting probably visiting and living if you want to mostpeople are gonna want to come back to to
 earth I think but there'll be some people and it's not such a long it's agood view it's a beautiful view so I
 think that we will have you know many people on the moon as well I thinkthere'll be some people you told me well
 you know hundreds of years out so we'll have people will be interplanetary forsure
 as a species so I think we'll be on the moon I think we'll be on Mars Venus noit's already a runaway greenhouse gas so
 not a great great place for science you know Jupiter all of in within the solarsystem great place for all of our
 scientific probes I don't see so much in terms of human physical presence we'llbe exploring them so we we live in our
 minds there because we're exploring them and going on those journeys but it'sreally our choice in terms of our
 decisions of how in balance you know we're gonna be living here on the earth

0:38:08
Speaker 0 :when do you think the first woman first
 person will step on Mars I asked about

0:38:12
Speaker 1 :Mars Vaughn I'm gonna do everything I
 can to make sure it happens in the 2030s so I say mid you know 2020 mid 20 youknow 2025 2030 five will be on the moon
 and hopefully with more people than less but first with you know a few astronautsit'll be global international folks but
 we really need those 10 years I think on the moon and then so by the way later inthe decade in the 2030s we will have all
 the technology and know-how and we need to get that you know human mission toMars 10 live in exciting times and David
