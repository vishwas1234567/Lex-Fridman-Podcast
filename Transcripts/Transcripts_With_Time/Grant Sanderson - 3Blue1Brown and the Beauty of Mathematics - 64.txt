 if there's intelligent life out there in the universe do you think theirmathematics is different than ours


0:02:02
Speaker 1 :jumping right in I think it's probably
 very different there's an obvious sense the notation is different right I thinknotation can guide what the math itself
 is I think it has everything to do with the form of their existence right do you

0:02:17
Speaker 0 :think they have basic arithmetic sorry


0:02:20
Speaker 1 :interrupt yeah so I think they count
 right I think notions like 1 2 3 the natural numbers that's extremely wellnatural that's almost why we put that
 name to it as soon as you can count you have a notion of repetition rightbecause you can count by two two times
 or three times and so you have this notion of repeating the idea of countingwhich brings you addition and
 multiplication I think the way that we extend to the real numbers there's alittle bit of choice in that so there's
 this funny number system called the serial numbers that it captures the ideaof continuity it's a distinct
 mathematical object you could very well you know model the universe and motionof planets with that as the backend of
 your math right and you still have kind of the same interface with the front endof what physical laws you're trying to
 or what physical phenomena you're trying to describe with math and I wonder ifthe little glimpses that we have of what
 choices you can make along the way based on what different mathematicians havebrought to the table is just scratching
 the surface surface of what the different possibilities are if you havea completely different mode of thought
 right or a mode of interacting with the

0:03:28
Speaker 0 :universe and you think notation is the
 key part of the journey that we've taken

0:03:33
Speaker 1 :through math I think that's the most
 salient part that you'd notice at first I think the mode of thought is going toinfluence things more than like the
 notation itself but notation actually carries a lot of weight when it comes tohow we think about things more so than
 we usually give it credit for I would I

0:03:48
Speaker 0 :would be comfortable saying give a favor
 or least favorite piece of notation in terms of its effectiveness yes yeah well

0:03:53
Speaker 1 :so at least favorite one that I've been
 thinking a lot about that will be a video I don't know when but we'll seethe number e we write the function e to
 the X this general exponential function with a notation e to the X that impliesyou should think about a particular
 number this constant of nature you repeatedly multiply it by itself andthen you say well what's e to the square
 root of two and you're like oh well we've extended the idea of repeatedmultiplication that's and that's all
 nice that's all nice and well but very famously you have like e to the PIyou're like well we're extending the
 idea of repeated multiplication into the complex numbers yeah you can think aboutit that way in reality I think that it's
 just the wrong way of notationally representing this function theexponential function which itself could
 be represented a number of different ways you can think about it in terms ofthe problem it solves a certain very
 simple differential equation which often yields way more insight than trying totwist to the idea of repeated
 multiplication like take its arm and put it behind its back and throw it on thedesk and be like you will apply to
 complex numbers right that's not I don't think that's pedagogically helpful and

0:04:56
Speaker 0 :so the repeater multiplication is
 actually missing the main point the

0:05:01
Speaker 1 :power of e to the S I mean what it
 addresses is things where the rate at which something changes depends on itsown value but more specifically it
 depends on it linearly so for example if you have like a population that'sgrowing and the rate at which it grows
 depends on how many members of the population are already there it lookslike this nice exponential curve it
 makes sense to talk about repeated multiplication because you say how muchis there after one year two years three
 years you're multiplying by something the relationship can be a little bitdifferent sometimes where let's say
 you've got a ball on a string like a like a game of tetherball going around arope right and you say it's velocity is
 always perpendicular to its position that's another way of describing itsrate of change is being related to where
 it is but it's a different operation you're not scaling it it's a rotationit's this 90 degree rotation that's what
 the whole idea of like complex exponentiation is trying to capture butit's obfuscated in the notation when
 what it's actually saying like if you really parse something like e to the PII what it's saying is choose an origin
 always move perpendicular to the vector from that origin to you okaythen when you walk PI times that radius
 you'll be halfway around like that's what it's saying it's kind of the u-turn90 degrees and you walk you'll be going
 in a circle that's the phenomenon that it's describing but tryingto twist the idea of repeatedly
 multiplying a constant into that like I I can't even think of the number ofhuman hours of like intelligent human
 hours that have been wasted trying to parse that to their own liking anddesire among like scientists or
 electrical engineers if students have we were which if the notation were a littledifferent or the way that this whole
 function was introduced from the get-go were framed differently I think could

0:06:49
Speaker 0 :have been avoided right and you're
 talking about the most beautiful equation in mathematics but it's stillpretty mysterious isn't it like you're
 making it seem like it's a notational

0:06:58
Speaker 1 :it's not mysterious I think I think the
 notation makes it mysterious I don't think it's I think the fact that itrepresents it's pretty it's not like the
 most beautiful thing in the world but it's quite pretty the idea that if youtake the linear operation of a 90 degree
 rotation and then you do this general exponentiation thing to it that what youget are all the other kinds of rotation
 which is basically to say if you if your velocity vector is perpendicular to yourposition vector you walk in a circle
 that's pretty it's not the most beautiful thing in the world but it'squite pretty


0:07:28
Speaker 0 :the beauty of it I think comes from
 perhaps the awkwardness of the notation somehow still nevertheless comingtogether nicely because you have like
 several disciplines coming together in a single equation well in a sense like

0:07:42
Speaker 1 :historically speaking but that's true
 you've got so like the number E is significant like it shows up inprobability all the time it like shows
 up in calculus all the time it is significant you're seeing is sort ofmated with PI this geometric constant
 and I like the imaginary number and such I think what's really happening there isthe the way that a shows up is when you
 have things like exponential growth and decay right it's when this relation thatthat something's rate of change has to
 itself is a simple scaling right a similar law also describes circularmotion because we have bad notation we
 use the residue of how it shows up in the context of self-reinforcing growthlike a population growing or compound
 interest the constant associated with that isawkwardly placed into the context of how
 rotation comes about because they both come from pretty similar equations andso what we see is the e and the pi
 juxtaposed a little bit closer than they would bewith a purely natural representation I
 would think here's how I would describe the relationbetween the two you've got a very
 important function we might call X that's like the exponential functionwhen you plug in one you get this nice
 constant called EE that shows up in like probability and calculus if you try tomove in the imaginary direction it's
 periodic and the period is tau so those are these two constants associated withthis the same central function but for
 kind of unrelated reasons right and not unrelated but like orthogonal reasonsone of them is what happens when you're
 moving in the real direction one's what happens when you move in the imaginarydirection and like yeah those are
 related they're not as related as the famous equation seems to think it isit's sort of putting all of the children
 in one bed and they kind of like to sleep in separate beds if they have thechoice but you see them all there and
 you know there is a family resemblance but it's not that close

0:09:28
Speaker 0 :so actually think of it as a function is
 uh this is the better idea and that's a

0:09:36
Speaker 1 :notational idea and yeah and like here's
 the thing the constant e sort of stands is this numerical representative ofcalculus right yeah
 calculus is the like study of change mm-hmm so it's very at least there's alittle cognitive dissonance using a
 constant to represent the science of

0:09:53
Speaker 0 :change never thought of it that way yeah


0:09:54
Speaker 1 :yeah it makes sense why the notation
 came about that way yes because this is the first way that we saw it um in thecontext of things like population growth
 or compound interest it is nicer to think about as repeated multiplicationthat's definitely nicer but it's more
 that that's the first application of what turned out to be a much moregeneral function that maybe the
 intelligent life your initial question asked about would have come to recognizeas being much more significant than the
 single use case which lends itself to repeated multiplication notation but let

0:10:24
Speaker 0 :me jump back for a second to aliens and
 the nature of our universe okay do you think math is discovered or invented sowe're talking about the different kind
 of mathematics that could be developed by the alien species the impliedquestion is is yeah it's math discovered
 or invented is you know is fundamentally everybody going to discoverthe same principles of mathematics so


0:10:52
Speaker 1 :the way I think about it and everyone
 thinks about it differently but here's my takeI think there's a cycle at play where
 you discover things about the universe that tell you what math will be usefuland that math itself is invented in a
 sense but of all the possible maths that you could have invented it's discoveriesabout the world that tell you which ones
 are so like a good example here is the Pythagorean theorem when you look atthis do you think of that as a
 definition or do you think of that as a discovery from the historical

0:11:21
Speaker 0 :perspective right a discovery because
 there were but that's probably because they were using physical object to buildtheir intuition and from that intuition
 came the mathematics so the mathematics was some abstract world detached fromphysics but I think more and more math
 has become detached from you know we when you even look at modern physicsfrom string theory so even general
 relativity I mean all math behind the 20th and 21st century physics kind oftakes a brisk walk outside of what our
 mind can actually even comprehend in multiple dimensions for exampleanything beyond three dimensions maybe


0:12:05
Speaker 1 :four dimensions no higher dimensions can
 be highly highly applicable I think this is a common misinterpretation the ifyou're asking questions about like a
 five dimensional manifold that the only way that that's connected to thephysical world is if the physical world
 is itself a five dimensional manifold or

0:12:22
Speaker 0 :includes them wait wait wait a minute
 wait a minute you're telling me you can imagine a five dimensional manifold no

0:12:31
Speaker 1 :no that's not what I said I I'm I would
 make the claim that it is useful to a three dimensional physical universedespite itself not being three
 dimensional so it's useful meaningful

0:12:39
Speaker 0 :even understand a three dimensional
 world it would be useful to have five dimensional manifolds yes absolutely

0:12:44
Speaker 1 :

0:12:46
Speaker 0 :because of state spaces but you're
 saying there in some in some deep way for us humans it does it does alwayscome back to that three dimensional
 world for the useful usefulness that the dimensional world and therefore itstarts with a discovery but then we
 invent the mathematics that helps us make sense of the discovery in

0:13:05
Speaker 1 :a sense yes I mean just to jump off of
 the Pythagorean theorem it feels like a discovery you've got these beautifulgeometric proofs where you've got
 squares and you're modifying there is it feels like a discovery if you look athow we formalize the idea of 2d space as
 being r2 right all pairs of real numbers and how we define a metric on it anddefine distance okay hang on a second
 we've defined distance so that the Pythagorean theorem is true so thensuddenly it doesn't feel that great but
 I think what's going on is the thing that informed us what metric to put onr2 to put on our abstract representation
 of 2d space came from physical observations and the thing is there'sother metrics you could have put on it
 we could have consistent math with other notions of distance it's just that thosepieces of math wouldn't be applicable to
 the physical world that we study because they're not the ones where thePythagorean theorem holds so we have a
 discovery a genuine bona fide discovery that informed the invention theinvention of an abstract representation
 of 2d space that we call r2 and things like that and then from there you juststudy r2 is an abstract thing that
 brings about more ideas and inventions and mysteries which themselves mightyield discoveries those discoveries
 might give you insight as to what else would be useful to invent and it kind offeeds on itself that way that's how I
 think about it so it's not an either/or it's not that math is one of these orit's one of the others at different
 times it's playing a different role so

0:14:28
Speaker 0 :then let me ask the the Richard Fineman
 question then along that thread is what do you think is a difference betweenphysics and math there's a giant overlap
 there's a kind of intuition that physicists have about the world that'sperhaps outside of mathematics it's this
 mysterious art that they seem to possess we humans generally possess and thenthere's the beautiful rigour of
 mathematics that allows you to I mean just like what as we were sayinginvent frameworks of understanding our
 physical world so what do you think is the difference there and how big is it

0:15:11
Speaker 1 :well I think of math as being the study
 of like abstractions over patterns and purein logic and then physics is obviously
 grounded in a desire to understand the world that we live in yeah I thinkyou're going to get very different
 answers when you talk to different mathematicians because there's a widediversity and types of mathematicians
 there are some who are motivated very much by pure puzzles they might beturned on by things like combinatorics
 and they just love the idea of building up a set of problem-solving toolsapplying to pure patterns right there
 are some who are very physically motivated who who tried to invent newmath or discover math in veins that they
 know will have applications to physics or sometimes computer science and that'swhat drives them right like chaos theory
 is a good example of something that it's pure math that's purely mathematical alot of the statements being made but
 it's heavily motivated by specific applications to largely physics and thenyou have a type of mathematician who
 just loves abstraction they just love pulling into the more and more abstractthings the things that feel powerful
 these are the ones that initially invented like topology and then later onget really into category theory and go
 on about like infinite categories and whatnot these are the ones that love tohave a system that can describe truths
 about as many things as possible right people from those three different veinsof motivation into math are going to
 give you very different answers about what the relation at play here isbecause someone like flightmare Arnold
 who is this he's written a lot of great books many about like differentialequations and such he would say math is
 a branch of physics that's how he would think about it and of course he wasstudying like differential equations
 related things because that is the motivator behind the study of PDEs andthings like that well you'll have others
 who like especially the category theorists who aren't really thinkingabout physics necessarily it's all about
 abstraction and the power of generality and it's more of a happy coincidencethat that ends up being useful for
 understanding the world we live in and then you can get into like why is thatthe case that's sort of surprising that
 that which is about pure puzzles and abstraction also happens to describe thevery fundamentals of quarks and


0:17:23
Speaker 0 :everything else so what do you think the
 fundamentals of quarks and and the nature of reality is socompressible and too clean beautiful
 equations that are for the most part simple relatively speaking a lot simplerthan they could be so you have we
 mentioned somebody like Stephen Wolfram who thinks that sort of there'sincredibly simple rules underlying our
 reality but it can create arbitrary complexity but there is simple equationswhat I'm asking a million questions that


0:18:00
Speaker 1 :nobody knows the answer to but no idea
 why is it simple I it could be the case that there's like a filter iteration Iplayed the only things that physicists
 find interesting other ones little simple enough they could describe itmathematically but as soon as it's a
 sufficiently complex system like now that's outside the realm of physicsthat's biology or whatever have you and
 of course that's true all right you know maybe there's something what's like ofcourse there will always be some thing
 that is simple when you wash away the like non important parts of whatever itis that you're studying just some like
 an information theory standpoint there might be some like you you get to thelowest information component of it but I
 don't know maybe I'm just having a really hard time conceiving of what itwould even mean for the fundamental laws
 to be like intrinsically complicated like some some set of equations that youcan't decouple from each other well no


0:18:53
Speaker 0 :it could be it could be that sort of we
 take for granted that they're the the laws of physics for example are for themost part the same everywhere or
 something like that right as opposed to the sort of an alternative could be thatthe rules under which are the world
 operates is different everywhere it's like a like a deeply distributed systemor just everything is just chaos like
 not not in a strict definition of cast but meaning like just it's impossiblefor equations to capture for to
 explicitly model the world as cleanly as the physical does any we're almost takeit for granted that we can describe we
 can have an equation for gravity for action in a distance we can haveequations for some of these basic ways
 the planets moving just the the

0:19:47
Speaker 1 :

0:19:48
Speaker 0 :low-level at the atomic scale all the
 materials operate at the high scale how black holes operate but it doesn't it itseems like it could be there's infinite
 other possibilities where none of it could be compressible into such equationso it just seems beautiful it's also
 weird probably to the point you're making that it's very pleasant that thisis just for our minds right so it might
 be that our minds are biased to just be looking at the parts of the universethat are compressible and then we can
 publish papers on and have nice e equals

0:20:26
Speaker 1 :mc-squared equations right well I wonder
 would such a world with uncompressible laws allow for the kind of beings thatcan think about the kind of questions
 that you're asking that's true right like an anthropic principle coming intoplay at some weird way here I don't know
 like I don't know what I'm talking about

0:20:44
Speaker 0 :it or maybe the universe is actually not
 so compressible but the way our brain the the way our brain evolved were onlyable to perceive the compressible parts
 I mean we are so this is a sort of Chomsky argument we are just thesentence of apes over like really
 limited biological systems so totally make sense there were really limitedlittle computers calculators that are
 able to perceive certain kinds of things in the actual world is much morecomplicated well but we can we can do


0:21:13
Speaker 1 :pretty awesome things right like we can
 fly spaceships and that we have to have some connection of reality to be able totake our potentially oversimplified
 models of the world but then actually twist the world to our will based on itso we have certain reality checks that
 like physics isn't too far afield simply based on what we can do and the fact

0:21:35
Speaker 0 :that we can fly is pretty good it's


0:21:37
Speaker 1 :great the laws were working with our are
 working well so I mentioned to the

0:21:44
Speaker 0 :internet that I'm talking to you and so
 the internet gave some questions so I apologize for these but do you thinkwe're living in a simulation
 that the universe is a computer or the universe is the computation running a

0:22:00
Speaker 1 :computer it's conceivable what I don't
 buy is you know you'll have the argument that well let's say that it was the casethat you can have simulations then the
 simulated world would itself eventually get to a point where it's runningsimulations yes and then the the second
 layer down would create a third layer down and on and on and on soprobabilistically you just throw a dart
 at one of those layers we're probably in one of the simulated layers I think ifthere's some sort of limitations
 unlike the information processing of whatever the physical world is like itquickly becomes the case that you have a
 limit to the layers that could exist there because like the resourcesnecessary to simulate a universe like
 ours clearly is a lot just in terms of the number of bits at play and so thenyou can ask well what's more plausible
 that there's an unbounded capacity of information processing in whatever theylike highest up level universe is or
 that there's some bound to that capacity which then limits like the number oflevels available how do you play some
 kind of probability distribution on like what the information capacity is I haveno idea but I I don't mean like people
 almost assume a certain uniform probability over all of those metallayers that could conceivably exist when
 it's a little bit like a Pascal's wager on like you're not giving a low enoughprior to the mere existence of that
 infinite set of layers yeah that's true

0:23:20
Speaker 0 :but it's also very difficult to
 contextualize the amount so the amount of information processing power requiredto simulate like our universe seems like
 amazingly huge what you can always raise

0:23:35
Speaker 1 :two to the power of that exactly yeah
 like numbers bit big and we're easily

0:23:40
Speaker 0 :humbled but basically everything around
 us so it's very difficult to to kind of make sense of anything actually when youlook up at the sky and look at the stars
 in the immensity of it all to make sense of us the smallness of us theunlikeliness of everything that's on
 this earth coming to be then you could basically anything could be all laws ofprobability go out the window
 to me because I guess because the amount of information under which we'reoperating is very low we basically know
 nothing about the world around us relatively speaking and so so when Ithink about the simulation hypothesis I
 think is just fun to think about it but it's also I think there is a thoughtexperiment kind of interesting to think
 of the power of computation where there are the limits of a Turing machine sortof the limits of our current computers
 when you start to think about artificial intelligence how far can we get withcomputers and that's kind of where the
 simulation hypothesis useless me as a thought experiment is is the universejust the computer is it just the
 computation is all of this just the computation and so the same kind oftools we apply to analyzing algorithms
 can that be applied you know if we scale further and further and furtherwell the arbitrary power of those
 systems start to create some interesting aspects that we see in our universe orsomething fundamentally different needs
 to be created well it's interesting that

0:25:18
Speaker 1 :in our universe it's not arbitrarily
 large the power that you can place limits on for example how many bits ofinformation can be stored per unit area
 right like all of the physical laws we've got general relativity and likequantum coming together to give you a
 certain limit on how many bits you can store within a given range before itcollapses into a black hole like the
 idea that there even exists such a limit is that the very least thought-provokingwhen naively you might assume oh well
 you know technology could always get better and better we could get clevererand cleverer and you could just cram as
 much information as you want into like a small unit of space that makes me thinkit's at least plausible that whatever
 the highest level of existence is doesn't admit too many simulations orones that are at the scale of complexity
 that we're looking at obviously it's just as conceivable that they do andthat there are many but I I guess what
 I'm channeling is the surprise that I feltlearning that fact that there are the
 information is physical in this way is

0:26:26
Speaker 0 :that there's a finance to it okay let me
 just even go off on that from mathematics perspective and thepsychology perspective how do you mix
 are you psychologically comfortable with the concept of infinity I think so

0:26:40
Speaker 1 :are you okay with it I'm pretty okay
 yeah okay no not really it doesn't make

0:26:45
Speaker 0 :any sense to me


0:26:46
Speaker 1 :I don't know like how many how many
 words how many possible words do you think could exist that are just like

0:26:55
Speaker 0 :strings of letters so that that's a sort
 of mathematical statement as beautiful and we use infinity basically everythingwe do everything we do inside in science
 math and engineering yes but you said exist my the question is well you saidletters of words
 I said words words the to bring words into existence to me you have to startlike saying them or like writing them or
 like listing them that's an

0:27:22
Speaker 1 :instantiation okay combination how many


0:27:25
Speaker 0 :abstract words exist it was the idea of
 abstract yeah the the idea of abstract notions and ideas I think we should be

0:27:31
Speaker 1 :clear around terminology I mean you
 think about intelligence a lot like artificial intelligence would you notsay that what it's doing is a kind of
 abstraction they're like abstraction is key toconceptualizing the universe you get
 this raw sensory data you need I need something that every time you move yourface a little bit and the they're not
 pixels but like analog of pixels on my retina change entirely yeah that I canstill have some coherent notion of this
 is Lex and planet Lex yes right what that requires is you have a disparateset of possible images hitting me that
 are unified in a notion of Lex yeah right that's a kind of abstraction it'sa thing that could apply to a lot of
 different images that I see and it represents it in a much more compressedway and one that's like much more
 resilient to that I think in the same way if I'm talking about infinity as anabstraction I don't mean non-physical
 woowoo it like ineffable or something what Imean is it something that can apply to a
 multiplicity of situations that share certain common attribute in the same waythat the images of like your face on my
 retina Sharon common attributes that I can put thesingle notion to it like in that way
 infinity is an abstraction and it's very powerful and and it's a it's onlythrough such abstraction that we can
 actually understand like the world and logic and things and in the case ofinfinity the way I think about it the
 key entity is the property of always being able to add one more like nomatter how many words you can list you
 just throw an A at the end of one and you have another conceivable word youdon't have to think of all the words at
 once it's that property the oh I could alwaysadd one more that gives it this nature
 of infinite enos in the same way that they're certain like properties of yourface that give it the Lexx miss right so
 like infinity should be no more worrying than the I can always add one moresentiment that's a really elegant much


0:29:20
Speaker 0 :more elegant way than I could put it so
 thank you for doing that as yet another abstraction and yes indeed that's whatour brain does that's what intelligence
 systems do this what programming does that's what science does is buildabstraction on top of each other and yet
 there is at a certain point abstractions that go into the quote whoo right sortof and because we're now it's like it's
 like we built this stack of you know the the only thing that's true is the stuffthat's on the ground everything else is
 useful for interpreting this and at a certain point you might start floatinginto ideas that are surreal and
 difficult and and take us into areas that are disconnected from reality in away that we could never give back what


0:30:10
Speaker 1 :if instead of calling these abstract how
 different would it be in your mind if we call them general and the phenomenonthat you're describing is over
 generalization when you try them channelization yeah have a concept or anidea that's so general as to apply to
 nothing in particular in a useful way does that map to what you're thinking ofwhen you think of first of all I'm


0:30:29
Speaker 0 :playing a little just for the fun of it
 yeah and that devil's advocate and uh I I think our cognition our mind is unableto visualize so you do some incredible
 work with visualization and video I think infinity is very difficult tovisualize for our mind
 we can delude ourselves into thinking we can visualize it but we can't I don'tthat means I don't I would venture to
 say it's very difficult and so there's some concepts of mathematics like maybemultiple dimensions we could sort of
 talk about that are impossible for us to truly into it like and it just feelsdangerous to me to use these as part of
 our toolbox of abstractions on behalf of

0:31:16
Speaker 1 :your listeners I almost fear we're
 getting too philosophical oh no I I think to that point for any particularidea like this there's multiple angles
 of attack I think the when we do visualizeinfinity what we're actually doing you
 know you write dot dot dot one two three four dot dot right that's those aresymbols on the page that are insinuating
 a certain infinity what you're capturing with a little bit of design there is theI can always add one more property right
 I think I'm just as uncomfortable with you areif you try to concretize it so much that
 you have a bag of infinitely many things that I actually think of no not one twothree four dot dot dot one two three
 four five six seven eight I try to get them all and I had and you realize oh Iyou know your your brain would literally
 collapse into a black hole all of that and and I honestly feel this with a lotof math that I tried to read where I I
 don't think of myself as like particularly good at math in some wayslike I get very confused often when I am
 going through some of these texts and often when I'm feeling my head is likethis is just so damn have strict I just
 can't wrap my head around I just wanted to put something concrete to it thatmakes me understand and I think a lot of
 the motivation for the channel is channeling that sentiment of yeah a lotof the things that you're trying to read
 out there it's just so hard to connect to anything that you spend an hourbanging your head against a couple of
 pages and you come out not really knowing anything more other than somedefinitions maybe and a certain sense of
 self defeat right one of the reasons I focus so much on visualizations is thatI'm a big believer in
 I'm sorry I'm just really hampering out this idea of abstraction being clearabout your layers of abstraction yes
 right it's always tempting to start an explanation from the top to the bottomyeh you you give the definition of a new
 theorem you're like this is the definition of a vector space for examplewe're gonna that's how well start of
 course these are the properties of a vector space Yuma first from theseproperties we will derive what we need
 in order to do the math of linear algebra or whatever it might be I don'tthink that's how understanding works at
 all I think how understanding works is you start at the lowest level you canget it where rather than thinking about
 a vector space you might think of concrete vectors that are just lists ofnumbers or picturing it as like an arrow
 that you draw which is itself like even less abstract the numbers because you'relooking at quantities like the distance
 of the x-coordinate the distance of the y-coordinate it's as concrete as youcould possibly get and it has to be if
 you're putting it in a visual right like that it's an actual arrow it's an actual

0:33:55
Speaker 0 :

0:33:56
Speaker 1 :vector you're not talking about like a
 quote-unquote vector that could apply to any possible thing you have to chooseone if you're illustrating it and I
 think this is the power of being in a medium like video or if you're writing atextbook and you force yourself to put a
 lot of images is with every image you're making a choice with each choice you'reshowing a concrete example with each
 concrete example you're eating someone's path to understanding you know I'm sorry

0:34:20
Speaker 0 :to interrupt you but you just made me
 realize that that's exactly right so the visualization is you're creating whileyou're sometimes talking about
 abstractions the actual visualization is a explicit low-level example yes sothere there's an actual like in the code
 you have to say what the what the vector is what's the direction of the arrowwhat's the magnitude of the yeah so
 that's you're going the visualization itself is actually going to the bottom I

0:34:51
Speaker 1 :think and I think that's very important
 I also think about this a lot in writing scripts where even before you get to thevisuals the first instinct is to I don't
 know why I just always do I say the abstract thing I say the generaldefinition the powerful thing and then I
 fill it in with examples later always it will be more compelling and easier tounderstand when you flip that and
 instead you let someone's brain do the pattern recognition you just show them abunch of examples the brain is gonna
 feel a certain similarity between them then by the time you bring in thedefinition or by the time you bring in
 the formula its articulating a thing that's already in the brain that wasbuilt off of looking at a bunch of
 examples with a certain kind of similarity and what the formula does isarticulate what that kind of similarity
 is rather than being a high cognitive load set of symbols that needs to bepopulated with examples later on
 assuming someone still with you what is

0:35:47
Speaker 0 :the most beautiful or on inspiring idea
 you've come across in mathematics I don't know maybe it's an ID you'veexplored in your videos maybe not what
 mike just gave you pause it's the most

0:36:01
Speaker 1 :beautiful idea small or big so I think


0:36:03
Speaker 0 :

0:36:04
Speaker 1 :often the things that are most beautiful
 are the ones that you have like a little bit of understanding of but certainlynot an entire understanding it's a
 little bit of that mystery that is what makes it beautiful almost a moment of

0:36:17
Speaker 0 :the discovery for you personally almost
 just that leap of haha moment so

0:36:23
Speaker 1 :something that really caught my eye I
 remember when I was little there were these I come I think the series wascalled like wooden books or something
 these tiny little books that would have just a very short description ofsomething on the left and then a picture
 on the right I don't know who they're meant for but maybe it's like looselychildren or something like that but it
 can't just be children because of some of the things I was describing on thelast page of one of them some were tiny
 in there was this little formula the on the left hand had a sum over all of thenatural numbers you know it's like 1
 over 1 to the s plus 1 over 2 to the s plus 1 over 3 to the s on and on to theinfinity then on the other side had a
 product over all of the primes and it was a certain thing I had to do with allthe primes and like any good young math
 enthusiast I'd probably been indoctrinated with how chaotic andconfusing the primes are which they are
 and seeing this equation where on one site you have something that's asunderstandable as you could possibly get
 the counting numbers yes and on the other side is all the prime numbers itwas like this whoa they're related like
 this there's there's a simple description that includes like all theprimes getting wrapped together
 this this is like the Euler product for zeta function as I like later found outthe equation itself essentially encodes
 the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that every number can be expressed as aunique set of primes to me still there's
 I mean I certainly don't understand this equation or this function all that wellthe more I learn about it the prettier
 it is the idea that you can this is sort of what gets you representations ofprimes not in terms of Prime's
 themselves but in terms of another set of numbers they're like the non-trivialzeros of the zeta function and again I'm
 very kind of in over my head in a lot of ways as I like try to get to understandit but the more I do its it always
 leaves enough mystery that it remains very beautiful to me so whenever there's

0:38:12
Speaker 0 :a little bit of mystery just outside of
 the understanding that and by the way the process of learning more about ithow does that come about just your own
 thought or are you reading reading yes or is the visualization itself revealingmore to you visuals help I mean in one


0:38:28
Speaker 1 :time when I was just trying to
 understand like analytic continuation and playing around with visualizingcomplex functions this is what led to a
 video about this function it's titled something like visualizing the riemannzeta function it's one that came about
 because i was programming and tried to see what a certain thing looked like andthen i looked at it like well that's
 elucidating and then i decided to make a video about it but i mean you try to getyour hands on as much reading as you can
 you you know in this case i think if anyone wants to start to understand itif they have like a math background of
 some like they studied some in college or something like that like theprinceton companion to math has a really
 good article on analytic number theory and that itself has a whole bunch ofreferences and you know anything has
 more references and it gives you this like tree to start pawing through andlike you know you try to understand I
 try to understand things visually as I go that's not always possible but it'svery helpful when it does you recognize
 when there's common themes like in this casecousins of the Fourier transform I come
 into play and you realize oh it's probably pretty important to have deepintuitions of the fourier transform even
 if it's not explicitly mentioned in like these texts and you try to get a senseof what the common players are but I'll
 emphasize again like I feel very in over my head when I try to understand theexact relation between like the zeros of
 the Riemann zeta function and how they relate to the distribution of primes Idefinitely understand it better than I
 did a year ago I definitely understand it 1/100 as well as the experts on thematter do I assume but the slow path
 towards getting theirs it's fun it's charming and like to your question verybeautiful and the beauty is in the what


0:40:13
Speaker 0 :in the journey versus the destination
 well it's that each each thing doesn't

0:40:17
Speaker 1 :feel arbitrary I think that's a big part
 is that you have these unpredictable none yeah these very unpredictablepatterns were these intricate properties
 of like a certain function but at the same time it doesn't feel like humansever made an arbitrary choice in
 studying this particular thing so you know it feels like you're speaking topatterns themselves or nature itself
 that's a big part of it I think things that are too arbitrary it's just hardfor those to feel beautiful because and
 this is sort of what the word contrived is meant to apply to right and the one

0:40:52
Speaker 0 :they're not arbitrary means it could be
 you can have a clean abstraction an intuition that allows you to comprehend

0:41:04
Speaker 1 :it well to one of your first questions
 it makes you feel like if you came across another intelligent civilizationthat they'd be studying the same thing


0:41:11
Speaker 0 :it may be with different notation but
 personally yeah but yeah like that's

0:41:14
Speaker 1 :what I think you talk to that other
 civilization they're probably also studying the zeros of the Riemann zetafunction or it's like some variant
 thereof that is like a clearly equivalent cousin or something like thatbut that's probably on their on their
 docket whenever somebody does a lot of

0:41:32
Speaker 0 :something amazing I'm gonna ask the
 question that that you've already been asked a lot that you'll get more andmore asked in your life but what was
 your favorite video to create

0:41:46
Speaker 1 :Oh favorite to create one of my
 favorites is the title is who cares about topology you want me to pull it up

0:41:54
Speaker 0 :

0:41:55
Speaker 1 :or not if you want sure yeah it is about
 well it starts by describing an unsolved problem that still unsolved in mathcalled the inscribed square problem you
 draw any loop and then you ask are there four points on that loop that make asquare totally useless right this is not
 answering any physical questions it's mostly interesting that we can't answerthat question and it seems like such a
 natural thing to ask now if you weaken it a little bit and you ask can youalways find a rectangle you choose four
 points on this curve can you find a rectangle that's hard but it's doableand the path to it involves things like
 looking at a torus this surface with a single hole in it like a donut we'relooking at a mobius strip in ways that
 feel so much less contrived to when I first as like a little kid learned aboutthese surfaces and shapes like a mobius
 strip and a torus like what you learn is oh this mobius strip you take a piece ofpaper put a twist glue it together and
 now you have a shape with one edge and just one side and as a student youshould think who cares right like how
 does that help me solve any problems I thought math was about problem solvingso what I liked about the piece of math
 that this was describing that was in this paper by a mathematician namedVaughan was that it arises very
 naturally it's clear what it represents it's doing something it's not justplaying with construction paper and the
 way that it solves the problem is really beautiful so kind of putting all of thatdown and concretizing it right like I
 was talking about how when you have to put visuals to it it demands that what'son screen is a very specific example of
 what you're describing the cut the construction here is very abstract innature you describe this very abstract
 kind of surface in 3d space so then when I was finding myself in this case Iwasn't programming I was using Grapher
 that's like built into OSX for the 3d stuff to draw that surface you realizeoh man the topology argument is very non
 constructive I have to make a lot of you have to do a lot of extra work in orderto make the surface show up but then
 once you see it it's quite pretty very satisfying to see a specificinstance of it and you also feel like
 I've actually added something on top of what the original paper was doing thatit shows something that's completely
 correct it's a very beautiful argument but you don't see what it looks like andI found something satisfying and seeing
 what it looked like that could only ever have come about from the forcingfunction of getting some kind of image
 on the screen to describe the thing I was talking abut your most weren't able

0:44:22
Speaker 0 :to anticipate what its gonna look like I
 don't know idea I had no idea and it was

0:44:26
Speaker 1 :wonderful right it was totally it looks
 like a Sydney Opera House or some sort of Frank Gehry design and it was youknew it was gonna be something and you
 can say various things about it like oh it it touches the curve itself it has aboundary that's this curve on the 2d
 plane it all sits above the plane but before you actually draw it so it's veryunclear what the thing will look like
 and to see it it's very it's just pleasing right so that was that was funto make very fun to share I hope that it
 has elucidated for some people out there where these constructs of topology comefrom that it's not arbitrary play with
 construction paper so that's I think

0:45:04
Speaker 0 :this is good a good sort of example to
 talk a little bit about your process so you have you have a list of ideas sothat sort of the the curse of having
 having an active and brilliant mind is I'm sure you have a list that's growingfaster than you can utilize and but


0:45:23
Speaker 1 :

0:45:25
Speaker 0 :there's some sorting procedure depending
 on mood and interest and so on but okay so pick an idea then you have to try towrite a narrative arc it's sort of how
 do I elucidate how how do I make this idea beautiful and clear and explain itand then there's a set of visualizations
 that'll be attached to it sort of you've talked about some of this before butsort of writing the story attaching the
 visualizations can you talk through interesting painful beautiful parts ofthat process well the most painful is if


0:45:59
Speaker 1 :you've chosen a topic that you do want
 to do but then it's hard to think of I guess how to structure the script thisis sort of where I have been on one for
 like the last two or three months and I think the ultimately the rightresolution
 just like set it aside and instead do some other things where the script comesmore naturally because you sort of don't
 want to overwork a narrative that the more you've thought about it the lessyou can empathize with the student who
 doesn't yet understand the thing you're trying to teach

0:46:30
Speaker 0 :who is the judger in your head sort of
 the person the creature the essence that's saying this sucks er this is goodand you mentioned kind of the student
 you're you're thinking about um what can you uh who is that what is that thingthat's Chris that is the perfections
 that says this thing sucks you need to work on it in front of the two three

0:46:53
Speaker 1 :months I don't know I think it's my past
 self I think that's the entity that I'm most trying to empathize with is likeyou take who I was because it's kind of
 the only person I know like you don't really know anyone other than versionsof yourself so I start with the version
 of myself that I know who doesn't yet understand the thing right and then Ijust try to view it with fresh eyes a
 particular visual or a particular script like is this motivating does this makesense which has its downsides because
 sometimes I find myself speaking to motivations that only myself would beinterested in I don't like it I did this
 project on quaternions where what I really wanted was to understand what arethey doing in four dimensions can we see
 what they're doing in four dimensions right and I can way of thinking about itthat really answered the question in my
 head that maybe very satisfied and being able to think about concretely with a 3dvisual what are they doing to a 4d
 sphere and some like great this is exactly what my past self would havewanted right and I make a thing on it
 and I'm sure it's what some other people wanted to it but in hindsight I thinkmost people who want to learn about
 quaternions are like robotics engineers or graphics programmers who want tounderstand how they're used to describe
 3d rotations and like their use case was actually a little bit different than mypast self and in that way like I
 wouldn't actually recommend that video to people who are coming at it from thatangle of wanting to know hey I'm a
 robotics program or like how do these quarter neon things work to describeposition in 3d space I would say other
 great resources for that if you ever find yourself wanting to saybut hang on in what sense are they
 acting in four dimensions then come back but until then it's a little different

0:48:34
Speaker 0 :yeah it's interesting because so you
 have incredible videos on your networks for example and for my certainperspectives have probably I mean I
 looked at the is served my field and I've also looked at the basicintroduction of neural networks like a
 million times from different perspectives and it made me realize thatthere's a lot of ways to present it so
 you were sort of you did an incredible job I mean sort of thebut you could also do it differently and
 also incredible like to create a beautiful presentation of a basicconcept is requires sort of creativity
 requires genius and so on but you can take it from a bunch of differentperspectives in that video and you'll
 know which mean you realize that and just as you're saying you kind of have acertain mindset a certain view but from
 if you take a different view from a physics perspective from a neuroscienceperspective talking about neural
 networks or from robotics perspective or from let's see from a pure learningstatistics perspective so you you can
 create totally different videos and you've done that with a few actuallyconcepts where you've have taken
 different costs like at the at the at

0:49:51
Speaker 1 :

0:49:53
Speaker 0 :the Euler equation right the you've
 taken different views of that I think

0:49:57
Speaker 1 :I've made three videos on it and I
 definitely will make at least one more never enough never enough so you don't

0:50:03
Speaker 0 :think it's the most beautiful equation
 in mathematics no like I said as we

0:50:08
Speaker 1 :represent it it's one of the most
 hideous it involves a lot of the most hideous aspects of our notation I talkedabout II the fact that we use PI instead
 of tau the fact that we call imaginary numbers imaginary and then and actuallywonder if we use the I because of
 imaginary I don't know if that's historically accurate but at least a lotof people they read the eye and they
 think imaginary like all three of those facts it's like those are things thathave added more confusion than they
 needed to and we're wrapping them up in one equation like boy that's just veryhideous right the idea is that it does
 tie together when you want away the notation look it's okay it'spretty it's nice but it's not like
 mind-blowing greatest thing in the universe which is maybe what I wasthinking of when I said like once you
 understand something it doesn't have the same beauty like I feel like Iunderstand Euler's formula and I feel
 like I understand it enough to sort of see the version that just woke upit hasn't really gotten itself dressed
 in the morning that's a little bit groggy and there's bags under its eyesso years like it's their past yeah the


0:51:11
Speaker 0 :the the dating stage you know we're no
 longer dating right instead of dating

0:51:15
Speaker 1 :Bizet des function this head like she's
 beautiful and right and like we have fun and it's that that high dopamine partfor like maybe at some point will settle
 into the more mundane nature the relationship where I like see her forwho she truly is and she'll still be
 beautiful in her own way but it won't have the same romantic pizzazz rightwell that's the nice thing about


0:51:34
Speaker 0 :mathematics I think as long as you don't
 live forever there will always be enough mystery and fun with some of theequations even if you do the rate at


0:51:43
Speaker 1 :which questions comes up is much faster
 than the rate at which answers come up so if you could live forever would you I

0:51:48
Speaker 0 :

0:51:50
Speaker 1 :think so yeah do you think you don't


0:51:52
Speaker 0 :think mortality is the thing that makes
 life meaningful would your life be four

0:51:56
Speaker 1 :times as meaningful if you died at 25 so


0:52:01
Speaker 0 :this goes to infinity I think you and I
 that's really interesting so what I said is infinite not not four times longermm-hmm I said infinite so the the actual
 existence of the finiteness the existence of the end no matter thelength is the thing that may sort of
 from my comprehension of psychology it's such a deeply human it's such afundamental part of the human condition
 the fact that there is that we're mortal that the the fact that things and theysee it seems to be a crucial part of
 what gives them meaning I don't think at

0:52:38
Speaker 1 :least for me like it's a very small
 percentage of my time that mortality is salient that I'm like aware of the end

0:52:47
Speaker 0 :of my life what do you mean by me I'm
 trolling is it the ego is that the aid there's that the super-ego is aso you're the reflective self the Verna


0:52:56
Speaker 1 :Keys area that puts all this stuff into
 words yeah a small percentage of your

0:53:01
Speaker 0 :mind that is actually aware of the true
 motivations that drive you but my point

0:53:07
Speaker 1 :is that most of my life I'm not thinking
 about death but I still feel very motivated to like make things and tolike interact with people like
 experienced love or things like that I'm very motivated and I it's strange thatthat motivation comes while death is not
 in my mind at all and this might just be because I'm young enough that it's notsalient force in your subconscious or


0:53:25
Speaker 0 :that you were instructed an illusion
 that allows you to escape the fact of your mortality by enjoying the moment soto the existential approach life would


0:53:35
Speaker 1 :be gun to my head I don't think that's
 it yeah another another sort of would

0:53:39
Speaker 0 :say gun to the head it's the deep
 psychological introspection of what drives us I mean that's uh in some waysto me I mean when I look at math when I
 look at science is the kind of an escape from reality in a sense that it's sobeautiful it's such a beautiful journey
 of discovery that it allows you to actually is it allows you to achieve akind of immortality of explore ideas and
 sort of connect yourself to the thing that is seemingly infinite like theuniverse right that allows you to escape
 the the limited nature of our little of our bodies of our existence what else

0:54:24
Speaker 1 :would give this podcast meaning that's
 right if not the fact that it will end

0:54:29
Speaker 0 :this place closes in in 40 minutes and


0:54:31
Speaker 1 :it's so much more meaningful for it how
 much more I love this room because we'll be kicked out so I understand just

0:54:38
Speaker 0 :because you're trolling me doesn't mean


0:54:44
Speaker 1 :I'm wrong but I take your point I take


0:54:46
Speaker 0 :your point


0:54:49
Speaker 1 :boy that would be a good Twitter bio
 just because you're trolling me doesn't mean I'm wrong yeah and and sort of

0:54:56
Speaker 0 :difference in backgrounds I'm a bit
 Russian so we're a bit melancholic and it seemed to maybe assign a little toomuch value just suffering immortality
 and things like that make makes for a better novel I think ohyeah you need you need some sort of


0:55:10
Speaker 1 :existential threat yeah to drive a plot


0:55:15
Speaker 0 :so when do you know when the video is
 done when you're working on it

0:55:20
Speaker 1 :that's pretty easy actually because I'm
 you know I'll write the script I want there to be some kind of aha moment inthere and then hopefully the script can
 revolve around some kind of aha moment and then from there you know you'reputting visuals to each sentence that
 exists and then you narrate it you edit it all together so given that there's ascript the the end becomes quite clear
 and you know you're as I as I animated I often change the certainly the specificwords but sometimes the structure itself
 but it's a very deterministic process at that point it makes it much easier topredict when something will be done how
 do you know when a script is done it's like for problem-solving videos that'squite simple it's it's once you feel
 like someone who didn't understand the solution now could for things likeneural networks that was a lot harder
 because like you said there's so many angles at which you could attack it andthere it's it's just at some point you
 feel like this this asks a meaningful question and it answers that questionright what is the best way to learn math


0:56:18
Speaker 0 :for people who might be at the beginning
 of that journey I think that's a it's a question that a lot of folks kind of askand think about and it doesn't even for
 folks who are not really at the beginning of their journey like theremight be actually is deep in their
 career some type they've taken college a taking calculus and so on but stillwanna sort of explore math well what
 would be your advice instead of education at all ages your temptation

0:56:43
Speaker 1 :will be to spend more time like watching
 lectures or reading try to force yourself to do more problems than younaturally would that's a big one like
 the the focus time that you're spending should be on like solving specificproblems and seek entities that have
 well curated lists of problems so go

0:57:03
Speaker 0 :into like a textbook almost in and the
 problems in the back of a text and back of a chapter so if you can take a little

0:57:08
Speaker 1 :look through those questions at the end
 of the chapter before you read the chapter a lot of them won't make sensesome of them might and those are those
 are the best ones to think about a lot of them won't but just you know take aquick look and then read a little bit of
 the chapter and maybe take a look again and thingslike that and don't consider yourself
 done with the chapter until you've actually worked through a coupleexercises right and and this is so
 hypocritical right because I like put out videos that pretty much never haveassociated exercises I just view myself
 as a different part of the ecosystem which means I'm kind of admitting thatyou're not really learning or at least
 this is only a partial part of the learning process if you're watchingthese videos
 I think if someone's at the very beginning like I do think Khan Academydoes a good job they have a pretty large
 set of questions you can work through just a very basic sort of just picking

0:57:57
Speaker 0 :picking out getting getting comfortable
 is a very basically algebra calculus fun Khan Academy programming is actually I

0:58:04
Speaker 1 :think a great like learned to program
 and like let the way the math is motivated from that angle push youthrough I know a lot of people who
 didn't like math got into programming in some way and that's what turned them onto math maybe I'm biased cuz like I live
 in the Bay Area so I'm more likely to run into someone who has that phenotypebut I am willing to speculate that that
 is a more generalizable path so you

0:58:28
Speaker 0 :yourself kind of in creating the videos
 are using programming to illuminate a concept but for yourself as well sowould you recommend somebody try to make
 a sort of almost like try to make videos like you do what's the one thing I've

0:58:41
Speaker 1 :heard before I don't know if this is
 based on any actual study this might be like a total fictional anecdote ofnumbers but it rings in the mind as
 being true you remember about 10 percent of what you read you remember about 20%of what you listen to remember about 70%
 of what you actively interact with in some way and then about 90% of what youteach this is a thing I heard again
 those numbers might be meaningless but they bring true don't theyright I'm willing to say I learned the
 nine times better than reading that might even be a lowball yeah right so sodoing something to teach or to like
 actively try to explain things is huge for consolidating the knowledge outside

0:59:18
Speaker 0 :of family and friends is there a moment
 you can remember that you would like to relive because it made you truly happyor it was transformative in some
 fundamental way a moment that was

0:59:30
Speaker 1 :transformed


0:59:33
Speaker 0 :or made you truly happy yeah I think


0:59:35
Speaker 1 :there's times like music used to be a
 much bigger part of my life than it is nowlike when I was a let's say a teenager
 and I can think of sometimes in like playing music there was one way at mycommand my brother and a friend of mine
 this slightly violates the family and friends but there was a music that mademe happy they were just company um we
 like played a gig at a ski resort such that you like take a gondola to the topand like did a thing then on the gondola
 ride down we decided to just jam a little bit and it was just like I don'tknow the the gondola sort of over came
 over a mountain and you saw the the city lights and were just like jamming likeplaying some music I wouldn't describe
 that nice transformative I don't know why but that popped into my mind as amoment of in a way that wasn't
 associated with people I love but more with like a thing I was doing somethingthat was just it was just happy and it
 was just like it a great moment I don't think I can give you anything deeperthan that though well as a musician


1:00:32
Speaker 0 :myself I'd love to see as you mentioned
 before music enter back into your work and back into your creative work I'dlove to see that I'm certainly allowing
 you to enter back into mine and it's it's a it's a beautiful thing formathematician for scientists to allow
 music to enter their work I think only good things can happen all right I'll

1:00:54
Speaker 1 :try to promise you a music video by 2021
 but by 20 by the end of 2020 I give myself a longer window all right maybe

1:01:02
Speaker 0 :we can like collaborate on a band type
 situation what instruments do you play

1:01:07
Speaker 1 :the main instrument I play is violin but
 I also love to devil around on like guitar and piano for me to eat our own

1:01:12
Speaker 0 :piano so in in a mathematicians limit
 Paul Lockhart writes the first thing to understand is that mathematics is an artthe difference between math and the
 other arts such as music and painting is that our culture does not recognize itas such so I think I speak for millions
 of people myself included in saying thank you for revealing to us the art ofmathematics so thank you for everything
 you do and thanks for talking today well
