Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Steven Kotkin a professor of history at Princeton University and one of thegreat historians of our time
 specializing in Russian and Soviet history he has written many books onStalin in the Soviet Union including the
 first to of a three-volume work on Stalin and he's currently working onvolume three he may have noticed that
 I've been speaking with not just computer scientists but physicistsengineers historians neuroscientists and
 soon much more to me artificial intelligence is much bigger than deeplearning bigger than computing it is our
 civilizations journey into understanding the human mind and creating echoes of itin the machine to me that journey must
 include a deep historical and psychological understanding of powertechnology puts some of the greatest
 power in the history of our civilization into the hands of engineers and computerscientists this power must not be abused
 and the best way to understand how such abuse can be avoided is to not be blindto the lessons of history as Steven
 kotkin brilliantly articulates Stalin was arguably one of the most powerfulhumans in history I've read many books
 on Joseph Stalin Vladimir Putin and the wars the 20th century I hope youunderstand the value of such knowledge
 to all of us especially to engineers and scientists who build the tools of powerin the 21st century this is the

0:03:13
Speaker 0 :beings crave security they crave love
 they crave adventure they crave power but not equally some human beings

0:03:25
Speaker 1 :nevertheless do crave power for sure
 what words is that deeply in the psychology of people is it somethingyou're born with
 is it something you develop some people

0:03:37
Speaker 0 :crave a position of leadership or of
 standing out of being recognized and that could be starting out in the schoolyears on the schoolyard it could be
 within their own family not just in their peer group those kind of people weoften see craving leadership positions
 from a young age often end up in positions of power but they can bevaried positions of power you can have
 power in an institution where your power is purposefully limited for examplethere's a board or a consultative body
 or a separation of powers not everyone craves power whereby they're the solepower or there they're unconstrained
 power that's a little bit less usual we may think that everybody does but noteverybody does those people who do crave
 that kind of power unconstrained the ability to decide as much as life ordeath of other people most people are
 not everyday people they're not the people you encounter in your daily lifefor the most part those are
 extraordinary people most of them don't have the opportunity to live that dreamvery few of them in fact end up with the
 opportunity to live that dream so

0:05:05
Speaker 1 :percentage-wise in your sense if we
 think of George Washington for example most would most people given the choiceof absolute power over a country versus
 maybe the capped power that the United States presidentpresidential role at least at the
 founding of the country represented what do you think most people would choose

0:05:28
Speaker 0 :well Washington was in a position to
 exercise far greater power than he did and in fact he didn't take that optionhe was more interested in seeing
 institutionalization of seeing the country develop strong institutionsrather than an individual leader like
 himself have excess power so that's very important so like I said not everyonecraves unconstrained power even if
 they're very ambitious and of course Washington was very ambitious he was asuccessful general before he was a
 president so that clearly comes from the influences on your life where you growup how you grow up how you raised what
 kind of values are imparted to you along the way you can understand power as theability to share or you can understand
 or the ability to advance something for the collective in a collective processnot an individual process so power comes
 in many different varieties and ambition doesn't always equate to despotic powerthe spotted power is something different
 from ordinary institutional power that we see right the president of MIT doesnot have unconstrained power the
 president of MIT rightly must consult with other members of the administrationwith the faculty members to a certain
 extent with the student body and certainly with the trustees of MIT thoseconstraints are make the institution
 strong and enduring and make the decisions better than they would be ifhe had unconstrained power but you can't
 say that the president is not ambitious of course the president is ambitious weworry about unconstrained power we worry
 about executive authority that's not limited that's the definition ofauthoritarianism or tyranny
 unlimited or barely limited executive authority executive authority isnecessary to carry out many functions we
 all understand that that's why MIT has an executive has a president butunlimited or largely unconstrained
 executive power is detrimental to even the person who exercises that power so

0:08:02
Speaker 1 :what do you think it's an interesting
 notion we kind of take it for granted that constraints on executive power is agood thing but why is that necessarily
 true so what is it about absolute power that does something bad to the humanmind
 so you know the popular saying of absolute power corrupts absolutely isthat the case that the power in itself
 is the thing that corrupts the mind in some kind of way where it leads to a bad

0:08:37
Speaker 0 :leadership over time people make more
 mistakes when they're not challenged when they don't have to explain thingsand get others to vote and go along with
 it when they can make a decision without anybody being able to block theirdecision or to have input necessarily on
 their decision you're more prone to mistakes you're more prone to extremismthere's a temptation there for example
 we have separation of powers in the United States the Congress right hasAuthority that the president doesn't
 have as for example in budgeting the so-called power of the purse this can bevery frustrating people want to see
 things happen and they complained that there's a do-nothing Congress or thatthe situation is stalemated but actually
 that's potentially a good thing in fact that's how our system was designed oursystem was designed to prevent things
 happening in government and there's frustration with that but ultimatelythat's the strength of the institutions
 we have and so when you see unconstrainedexecutive authority there can be a lot
 of dynamism a lot of things can get done quickly but those things can be like forexample what happened in China under Mao
 or what happened in the Soviet Union under Stalin or what happened in Haition the Papa Doc and then baby doc or
 fill in the blank right what happens sometimes in corporations where acorporate leader is not constrained by
 the shareholders by the board or by anything and they can seem to be agenius for a while but eventually it
 catches up to them and so the idea of constraints on executive power isabsolutely fundamental to the American
 system American way of thinking and not only America obviously large other partsof the world that have a similar system
 not an identical system but a similar system of checks and balances onexecutive power and so the the the case
 that I study the only checks and balances on executive power arecircumstantial so for example distances
 in the country it's hard to do something over 5,000 miles or the amount of timein a day it's hard for a leader to get
 to every single thing the leader wants to get to because there are only 24hours in a day
 those are circumstantial constraints on executive power they're notinstitutional constraints on executive


0:11:20
Speaker 1 :power one of the constraints on
 executive power the United States has versus Russia maybe something you'veimplied and actually spoke directly to
 is there's something in the Russian people in the Soviet people they'reattracted to authoritarian power
 psychologically speaking or at least the kind of leaders at that sought authorityand power throughout its history and
 that desire for that kind of human is a lack of a constraint in America it seemsas people we desire somebody not like
 Stalin somebody more like George Washington so that's another constraintof the belief the people would
 they admire in a leader what they seek in a leader so maybe you can speak towell first of all can you speak briefly
 to that psychology of is there a difference between the Russian peopleand the American people in terms of just
 what we find attractive in a leader not

0:12:23
Speaker 0 :as great a difference as it might seem
 there are unfortunately many Americans who would be happy with an authoritarianleader in the country is by no means a
 majority it's not even a plurality but nonetheless it's a real sentiment in thepopulation sometimes because they feel
 frustrated because things are not getting done sometimes because they'reagainst something that's happening in
 the political realm and they feel it has to be corrected and corrected quicklyit's a kind of impulse people can regret
 the impulse later on the impulse is motivated by reaction to theirenvironment in the Russian case we have
 also people who crave sometimes known as a strong hand and iron hand andauthoritarian leader because they want
 things to be done and be done more quickly that align with their desireswhat I'm not sure it's a majority in the
 country today certainly in Stalin's time this was a widespread sentiment andpeople had few alternatives that they
 understood or could appeal to nowadays in the globalized world the citizens ofRussia can see how other systems have
 constraints on executive power in the life isn't so bad there in fact a lifemight even be better
 so the impatience the impulsive quality the frustration does sometimes in peoplereinforce their craving for the
 unconstrained executive to quote get things done or shake things up or yesthat's true
 but in the Russian case I'm not sure it's cultural today I think it might bemore having to do with the failures the
 functional failures of the kind of political system that they tried toinstitute after the Soviet collapse and
 so it may be frustration with the version of constraints on executivepower they got and how it didn't work
 the way it was imagined which has led to a sense in which non constrainedexecutive power could fix things what
 like like I'm not sure that that's the majority sentiment in the Russian casealthough it's hard to measure because
 under authoritarian regimes public opinion is shaped by theenvironments in which people live which
 is very constrained in terms of public

0:15:04
Speaker 1 :opinion but on that point why at least
 from a distance desert seem to nevertheless be support for the currentRussian President Vladimir Putin is that
 have to do with the fact that measuring getting good metrics and statistics onsupport is difficult know that Aryan
 governments or is there still something appealing to that kind of power to the

0:15:29
Speaker 0 :people I think we have to give credit to
 President Putin for understanding the psychology of the Russians who to whomhe appeals many of them were the losers
 in the transition from communism they were the ones whose pensions weredestroyed by inflation or whose salaries
 didn't go up or whose regions were abandoned they were not the winners forthe most part and so I think there's an
 understanding on his part of their psychology Putin has grown in theposition he was not a public politician
 when he first started out he was quite poor in public settings he didn't havethe kind of political instincts that he
 has now he didn't have the appeal to traditional values in the OrthodoxChurch and some of the other dimensions
 of his rule today so yes we have to give some credit to Putin himself for thisin addition to the frustrations and the
 mass of the people but let's think about it this wayin addition without taking away the fact
 that he's become a better politician over time and that sentiment has shiftedbecause of the disappointments with the
 transition with the population when I asked my kids am I a good dadmy kids don't have any other dad to
 measure me against I'm the only dad they know and I'm the only dad they canchoose or not choose they think if they
 don't choose me they still get me as dad rightso with Putin today he's the only dad
 that the Russian people have now if my kids were introduced to alternativefathers they might be better than me
 they might be more loving more giving funnier richer whatever it might be theymight be more appealing there are some
 blood ties there for sure with that I have with my kidsbut they would at least be able to
 choose alternatives and then I would have to win their favor in thatconstellation of alternatives if
 President Putin were up against real alternatives if the population had realchoice and that choice could express
 itself and have resources and have media and everything else the way he doesmaybe he would be very popular and maybe
 his popularity would not be as great as it currently is so the absence ofalternatives is another factor that
 reinforces his authority and his popularity having said that there aremany authoritarian leaders who deny any
 alternatives to the population and are not very popular so denial ofalternatives doesn't guarantee you the
 popularity you still have to figure out the mass psychology and be able toappeal to it so with with the in the
 Russian case the winners from the transition live primarily inthe big cities and our self employed or
 intrapreneurial even if they're not self employed there they're able to changecareers they have tremendous skills and
 talent and education and knowledge as well as these entrepreneurial or dynamicpersonalities Putin also appealed to
 them he did that with Medvedev and it was a very clever ruse he himselfappealed to the losers from the
 transition the small towns the rural the people who were not well-off and he hadthem for the most part not all we don't
 want to generalize to say that he had every one of them because those peoplehave views of their own sometimes in
 contradiction with the President of Russia and then he appealed to theopposite people the successful urban
 base through the so-called reformer with the idea of the new generation thetechnically literate prime minister who
 for a time was president and so that worked very successfully for Putin hewas able to bridge a big divide in the
 society and gain a greater mass support than he would otherwise have had byhimself that ruse only worked through
 the time that Medvedev was temporarily president for a few years because of theConstitution Putin couldn't do three
 consecutive terms and stepped aside in what they call castling in chess thiswhen this was over Putin had difficulty
 with his popularity there were mass protests in the urban areas preciselythat group of the population that he had
 been able to win in part because of the Medvedev castling and now had had theirdelusions exposed and were disillusioned
 and there were these mass protests in the urban areas not just in the capby the way and Putin had to as it were
 come up with a new way to fix his popularity which happened to be theannexation of Crimea from which he got a
 very significant bump however he the trend is back in theother direction it's diminishing again
 although it's still high relative to other leaders around the world so Iwouldn't say that he's unpopular with
 mass in Russia he there is some popularity there there is some successbut I would say it's tough for us to
 gauge because of the lack of alternatives and Putin is unpopularinside the State Administration at every


0:21:41
Speaker 1 :level deeper accuracy of because no


0:21:45
Speaker 0 :simple are well informed and they
 understand that the country is declining that the human capital is declining theinfrastructure is declining the economy
 is not really growing it's not really diversifying Russia's not investing inits future the state officials
 understand all of that and then they see that the Putin cleek is stealingeverything in sight so between the
 failure to invest in a future and the corruption of a narrow group around thepresident there's disillusionment in the
 state apparatus because they see this more clearly or more closely than themass of the population they can't
 necessarily yet oppose this in public because there are people they havefamilies they have careers they have
 children who want to go to school or want a job and so there are constraintson their ability to oppose the regime
 based upon what we might call cowardice or other people might call realismI don't know how courageous people can
 be when their family children career are on the line so it's very interestingdynamic to see the disillusionment
 inside the government with the president which is not yet fully public for thebut could become public and once again
 if there's an alternative if an alternative appears things could shiftquickly and that alternative could come
 from inside the regime from inside the

0:23:21
Speaker 1 :regime but the leadership the the party
 the people that are now as you're saying opposed to Putin they're neverthelessmaybe you can correct me but it feels
 like there's structural he's deeply corrupt so each of each of the peoplewe're talking about our and don't feel
 like a George Washington once again the

0:23:47
Speaker 0 :circumstances don't permit them to act
 that way necessarily right George Washington did great things but incertain circumstances a lot of the state
 officials in Russia for certain are corrupt there's no question many of themhowever are patriotic and many of them
 feel badly about where the country has been going they would prefer that thecountry was less corrupt they would
 prefer that there were greater investment in all sorts of areas ofRussia they might even themselves steal
 less if they could be guaranteed that everybody else would steal less there'sa deep and abiding patriotism inside
 Russia as well as inside the Russian regime so they understand that Putin inmany ways rescued the Russian state from
 the chaos of the 1990s they understand that Russia was in very bad shape as anincoherent failing state almost when
 Putin took over and that he did some important things for Russia's stabilityand consolidation there's also some
 appreciation that Putin stood up to the West and stood up to more powerfulcountries and regained a sense of pride
 and maneuverability for Russia in the international system people appreciatethat and it's real it's not imagined
 that Putin accomplished that the problem is the methods that he accomplished itwith he used the kind of methods that is
 the same taking other people's property putting other people in jail forpolitical reasons he used the kind of
 methods that are not conducive to long-term growth and stability so hefixed the problem but he fixed the
 problem and then created even bigger long-term problems potentially andmoreover all authoritarian regimes that
 use those methods are tempted to keep using them and using them and using themuntil they're the only ones who are the
 beneficiaries and the group narrows and narrows the elite gets smaller andnarrower the interest groups get
 excluded from power and their ability to continue enjoying the fruits of thesystem and the resentment grows and so
 that's the situation we have in Russia is a place that is stuck it was to acertain extent rescued it was rescued
 with methods that were not conducive to long-term success and stability the

0:26:37
Speaker 1 :rescue referring to is this of the
 economic growth when Putin first tests

0:26:42
Speaker 0 :took office they had 10 years they had a
 full decade of an average of 7% growth a year which was phenomenal and is notattributable predominantly to oil prices
 during president Putin's first term as president the average price of oil was$35 a barrel during his second term as
 president the average price was $70 a barrel so during those two terms whenRussia was growing at about 7% a year
 oil prices were averaging somewhere around $50 a barrel which is finebut is not the reason because later on
 when oil prices were over $100 a barrel Russia stagnated so the initial growth

0:27:30
Speaker 1 :do you think Putin deserves some credit


0:27:34
Speaker 0 :for that yes he does because he
 introduced some important liberalizing measureshe lowered taxes he allowed land to be
 bought and sold he deregulated many areas of the economy and so there was akind of intrapreneurial burst that were
 that was partly attributable partly attributable to government policy duringhis first term but also he was
 consolidating political power and as I said the methods he used overall for thelong term were not able to continue
 sustain that success in addition we have to remember that China played a reallybig role in the success of Russia in the
 first two terms of Putin's presidency because China's phenomenal growthcreated insatiable demand for just about
 everything that the Soviet Union used to produce so fertilizers cementfill-in-the-blank
 chemicals metals China had insatiable demand for everything the Soviet Uniononce produced and so China's global
 raising of global demand overall brought soviet-era industry back from the deadand so there was something that happened
 Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in the 1990s there was a decline inmanufacturing and industrial production
 greater than in the great depression in the US but a lot of that came backonline in the 2000s and that had to do
 with China's phenomenal growth the trade between China and Russia was not alwaysdirect so this was an indirect effect
 but raising global prices for the commodities and the products the kind oflower and lower value products in
 manufacturing not high-end stuff but lower and stuff like steel or iron orcement or fertilizer where the
 value-added is not but nonetheless which had been destroyedby the 1990s and after the Soviet
 collapse this was brought back to life now you can do that once you can bringSoviet era industry back to life once
 and that happened during Putin's first two terms in addition to theliberalizing policies which spurred
 intrapreneurial ISM and some small and medium business the crash of the rublein 1998 which made Russian products much
 cheaper abroad and made imports much more expensive also facilitated theresuscitation the revival of domestic
 manufacturing so all of this came together for that spectacular 10-yearseven percent on average economic growth
 and moreover people's wages after inflation their disposable income grewmore even than GDP grew so disposable
 income after inflation that is a real income was growing greater than sevenpercent in some cases ten percent a year
 so there was a boom and the Russian people felt it and it happened duringPutin's first two terms and people were
 grateful rightly so for that and those who don't want to give Putin credit giveoil prices all the credits but I don't
 think that oil prices can explain this having said that that doesn't mean thatthis was sustainable over the long term


0:31:28
Speaker 1 :so you've briefly mentioned sort of
 implying the possibility Stalin held power for let's say thirty years youbriefly mentioned that as a question
 will Putin be able to beat that record to beat that so can you talk about yoursense of is it possible that Putin holds
 power for that kind of duration let's

0:31:53
Speaker 0 :hope not let's hope not for Russia's
 sake the primary victims of president Putin's power are Russiansthey're not Ukrainians although to a
 certain extent Ukraine has suffered because of Putin's actions and they'renot Americans they're Russians moreover
 Russia has lost a great deal of human talent yes millions and millions ofpeople have left Russia since 1991
 overall somewhere between five and ten million people have left the country andare beyond the borders of the former
 Soviet Union so they left the Soviets base entirely moreover the people wholeft are not the poor people they're not
 the uneducated they're not the losers the people who've left are the moredynamic parts of the population the
 better educated the more entrepreneurial so that human capital lost that Russiahas suffered is phenomenal and in fact
 right here we were sitting at MIT we have examples of people who arequalified good enough for MIT and have
 left Russia to come to MIT you're

0:33:10
Speaker 1 :looking at one of them and the other
 aspect just to quickly comment is those same people like me I'm not welcome back

0:33:20
Speaker 0 :no you're not under the current regime
 it was a big loss for Russia if you're patriotic but not from the point of viewof the Putin regime that has to do also
 factors into popularity if the people who don't like you leave they're notthere to complain to protest to vote
 against you and so your your opposition declines when you let them leave howeverit's very costly in human capital terms
 hemorrhaging that much human capital is damaging its self damaging and we'veseen it accelerate it was already high
 but we've seen it accelerate in the last oh seven eight years of PresidentPutin's rule and those people are not
 going back of their own volition but even if they wanted to go back as youjust said they'd be unwelcome that's a
 big cost to pay for this regime and so whatever benefits this regimemight or might not have given to the
 country the disadvantage is the downside the costs are also really high so wedon't want Putin lasting in power as
 long as Stalin it would be better if Russia were able to choose among optionsto choose a new leader among options
 many people speculate that President Putin will name a successor the wayYeltsin named Putin as his successor
 Boris president Boris Yeltsin and then Putin will leave the stage and allow thesuccessor to take over that might seem
 like a good solution but once again we don't need a system where you hang onfor as long as possible then nominate
 who's gonna take over we need a system that has the kind of correctivemechanisms that democracies and markets
 have along with rule of law a corrective mechanism is really important becauseall leaders make mistakes but when you
 can't correct for the mistakes then the mistakes get compounded a Putin couldwell he seems to be healthy he could
 well last as many years of Stalin it's hard to predict because events intercedesometimes and create circumstances that
 are unforeseen and leaders get overthrown or have a heart attack orwhatever there's a palace insurrection
 we're ambitious leaders on the inside for both personal power and patrioticreasons try to push aside an aging
 leader there are many scenarios in which Putin could not last that long butunfortunately right now you could also
 imagine potentially him lasting that long which as I said is not an outcomeif you're patriotic about Russia is not
 an outcome you would wish up to the

0:36:22
Speaker 1 :country is that I guess a very difficult
 question but what what practically do you feel is a wayout of the Putin regime as a way out of
 the corruption that's deeply underlies the the state is a if you look from ahistory perspective as a revolution
 required is some his violence required is in you know from a violence within orexternal to the country do you see or
 origin as a powerful is a inspiring leader enough to step in and bringdemocracy and kind of the free world to


0:37:08
Speaker 0 :Russia so Russia is not a failed country
 it's a middle-income country with the tremendous potential and has proven manytimes in the past that when it gets in a
 bad way it can reverse its trajectory moreover violence is rarely ever asolution violence rarely it may break an
 existing trend but it's rare that violence produces a non-violentsustainable positive outcome it happens
 but it doesn't happen frequently societal upheaval is not a way always toinstitutionalize a better path forward
 because you need institutions people can protest as they did throughout theMiddle East and the protests didn't
 necessarily lead to better systems because the step from protests to newstrong consolidated institutions is a
 colossal leap not a small step what we need and what we see from history andsituations like this is a group within
 the power structures which is a patriotic that sees things going downand that is to say that sees things not
 be developing relative to neighbors relative to richer countries relative tomore successful countries and they want
 to change the trajectory of Russia and if they can in a coalition fashionunseat the current regime for a new
 power sharing arrangement which once again can be frustrating because youcan't do changes immediately you can't
 do things overnight but that's the point constraints on your ability to changeeverything immediately and to force
 change overnight is what leads to long-term success potentially rightthat's the sustainability of change so
 Russia needs stronger institutions it needs court system as well asdemocratic institutions it needs
 functioning open dynamic markets rather than monopolies it needs meritocracy andbanks to award loans on the basis of
 business plans not on the basis of political criteria or corrupt bribery orwhatever it might be right so Russia
 needs those kind of functioning institutions that take time aresometimes slow don't lead to
 revolutionary transformation but lead to potentially long term sustainable growthwithout upheaval without violence
 without getting into a situation where all of a sudden you need a miracle againevery time Russia seems to need a
 miracle and that's the problem the the solution would be not needing a miraclenow having said that the potential is
 there the civilization that we call Russia's amazingly impressiveit has delivered world-class culture
 world-class science it's a great power it's not a great power with a strongbase right now but nonetheless it is a
 great power is a tax in the world so I wouldn't underestimate Russia'sabilities here and I wouldn't write-off
 Russia I don't see it under the current regime a renewal of the country but ifwe can have from within the regime and
 evolution rather than a revolution in a positive direction and maybe get aGeorge Washington figure who is strong
 enough to push through institutionalization rather than

0:41:06
Speaker 1 :personalism so if I could ask about one
 particular individual maybe just interesting to get your comment but alsoas a representative of potential leaders
 I just on the spot has talked to Gary Kasparov who I'm not sure if you'refamiliar with his his ongoings so
 besides being a world-class chess player he's also a very outspoken activist sortof seeing Putin truly seeing Putin as an
 enemy of the free world of democracy of balanced government in Russia what doyou think of people like him
 specifically or just people like him trying as leaders to step in to run forpresident to to symbolize a new chapter
 in Russia's future so we don't need

0:41:54
Speaker 0 :individuals some individuals are very
 impressive and they have courage and they protest and they criticize and theyorganize we need institutions we need a
 Duma or a parliament that functions we need a court system that functions thatis to say where there are a separation
 of powers impartial professional civil service impartial professional judiciarythose are the things Russia needs it's
 rare that you get that from an individual no matter how impressiveright
 we had Andrei Sakharov who was an extraordinary individual who developedthe hydrogen bomb under Soviet regime
 was a world-class physicist was then upset about how his scientific knowledgeand scientific achievements were being
 put to use and rebelled to try to put limits constraints civilizing you mainlimits and constrained
 on some of the implications of his extraordinary science but Sakharov evenif he had become the leader of the
 country which he did not become he was more of a moral or spiritual leader itstill wouldn't have given you a
 judiciary it still wouldn't have given you a civil service it still wouldn'thave given you a Duma or functioning
 Parliament you need a leader in coalition with other leaders you need abunch of leaders a whole group and they
 have to be divided a little bit so that not one of them can destroy all theothers and they have to be interested in
 creating institutions not just or not solely or predominantly in theirpersonal power and so I have no
 objection to outstanding individuals and to the work that they do but I think ininstitutional terms and they need to
 think that way too in order to be

0:44:05
Speaker 1 :successful so if we go back to the
 echoes of that after the Russian Revolution was Stalin or Lenin Stalinmaybe you can correct me but there was a
 group of people there in that same kind of way looking to establish institutionsthat were built in a you know in a


0:44:25
Speaker 0 :

0:44:27
Speaker 1 :beautifully built around an ideology
 that they believed is good for the world so sort of echoing that idea of whatwe're talking about what Russia needs
 now can you first of all you've described a fascinating thought which isStalin as having amassed arguably more
 power than any man in history she's interesting thing to think about but canyou tell about his journey to getting
 that power after the Russian Revolution how does that perhaps echo to the ourcurrent discussion about institutions
 and so on and just in general the story I think is fascinating of how one man isable to get more power than any other
 man in history

0:45:17
Speaker 0 :it is a great story not necessarily from
 a moral point of view but if you're interested in power for sure it's anincredible story so we have to remember
 that Stalin is also a product of circumstances not solely his ownindividual Drive which is very strong
 but for example World War one breaks the Czarist regime the Czarist orderImperial Russia in the state Stalin has
 no participation whatsoever in World War one he spends World War one in exile inSiberia until the downfall of the
 Czarist autocracy in February 1917 Stalin is in eastern Siberian exile he'sonly able to leave eastern Siberia when
 that regime Falls he never fights in the war he's called up briefly towards theend of the war and is disqualified on
 physical grounds because of physical deformities from being drafted the warcontinues after the Czar's regime has
 been toppled in the capital and there's been a revolution the war continues andthat war is very radicalizing the
 peasants begin to seize the land after the Tsar Falls essentially destroyingmuch of the gentry class Stalin has
 nothing to do with that the peasants have their own revolution seizing theland not in law but in fact de facto not
 desert land ownership so there are these really large processes underway thatStalin is alive during but not a driver
 of the most improbable thing happens which is a very small group of peoplearound the the figure of Vladimir Lenin
 announces that had in a seized power now by this time in October 1917 thegovernment that has replaced the Tsar
 the soap visional government has failed and sothere's not so much power to seize from
 the provisional government what Lenin does is he does a coup on theleft that is to say Soviets or councils
 as we would call them in English which represent people's power or the massesparticipating in politics a kind of
 radical grassroots democracy are extremely popular all over the countryand not dominated by any one group but
 predominantly socialist or predominantly leftist Russia has an election duringthe war a free and fair election for the
 most part despite the war at the end of 1917 in December 1917 and 3/4 plus ofthe country votes socialist in some form
 or another so the battle was over the definition of socialism and who had theright to participate in defining
 socialism not only what it would be but who had the right to decide so there's acoup by Lenin's group known as the
 Bolsheviks against all the other socialists and so Lenin declares aseizure of power whereby the old
 government has failed people's power the council's known as the Soviets are gonnatake their place and Lenin seizes power
 in the name of the Soviet so it's a coup against the left against the rest of theleft not against the provisional
 government that has replaced the Tsar which has already failed and so Stalinis able to come to power along with
 Lenin in this crazy seizure of power on the left against the rest of the left inOctober 1917 which we know is the
 October Revolution and I call the October coup as many other historianscall the October Revolution happened
 after the seizure of power what's interesting about this episode is thatthe leftists who seize power in the name
 of the Soviets in the name of the masses in the name of people's power theyretain their hold many times in history
 there's a seizure of power by the left and they fail they collapse they'recleaned out by an army or what we call
 forces of order by counter revolutionary forcesLenin's Revolution Lenin's coup is
 successful it is able to hold power and not just seize power they win a civilwar and they're entrenched in the heart
 of the country already by 1921 Stalin is part of that groupLenin needs somebody to run this new
 regime in the kind of nitty-gritty way Lenin is the leader the undisputedleader in the Bolshevik Party which
 changes their name to communists in 1918 he makes Stalin the General Secretary ofthe Communist Party he creates a new
 position which hadn't existed before a kind of day-to-day political manager aright-hand man
 not because Lenin is looking to replace himself he's looking to institutionalizea helpmate a right-hand man he does this
 in the spring of 1920 to stall and his name to this position which Lenin hascreated expressly for Stalin so there
 has been a coup on the Left where by the Bolsheviks who become communists haveseized power against the rest of the
 socialists and anarchists and the entire left and then there's aninstitutionalization of a position known
 as General Secretary of the Communist Party right-hand man of Lenin less thansix weeks after Lenin has created this
 position and installed Stalin Lenin has a stroke and a major strokereally returns as a full actor to power
 before he dies of a fourth stroke in January 1924 so a position is createdfor Stalin to run things on Lenin's
 behalf and then Lenin has a stroke and so Stalin now has this new positiongeneral secretary but he's the right
 hand of a person who's no longer exercising day-to-day control overaffairs Stalin then uses this new
 position to create a personal dictatorship inside the Bolshevikdictatorship which is the remarkable
 story I tried to tell so is there

0:52:26
Speaker 1 :anything nefarious about any of what you
 just described so it seems conveniently that thepositions created just for Stalin there
 was a few other brilliant people arguably more brilliant than Stalin inthe vicinity of Lenin why was Stalin
 chosen why did Lenin all of a sudden fall ill as perhaps a conspiratorialquestion but is there anything nefarious
 about any of this historical trajectory to power that Stalin took in creatingthe personal dictatorship so history is


0:53:03
Speaker 0 :full of contingency and surprise after
 something happens we all think it's inevitable it had to happen that wayeverything was leading up to it so
 Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933 and the Nazi regime getsinstitutionalized by several of his
 moves after being named Chancellor and so all German history becomes a story ofthe Nazi rise to power Hitler's rise to
 power every trend tendency is bent into that outcome things which don't seemrelated to that outcome all of a sudden
 get bent in that direction and all the trends that were going on are no longerexamined because they didn't lead to
 that outcome but Hitler's becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933 was notinevitable it was contingent
 he was offered the position by the traditional conservatives he's part ofthe radical right and the traditional
 right named him Chancellor the Nazi Party never outright won an electionthat was free and fair before Hitler
 came to power and in fact it's votes on the eve of Hitler becoming Chancellordeclined relative to the previous
 election so there's contingency in history and soLenin's illness his stroke the
 neurological and blood problems that he had were not a structure in history inother words if Lenin had been a
 healthier figure Stalin might never have become the Stalin that we know that'snot to say that all history is
 accidental just that we need to relate the structural the larger structuralfactors to the contingent factors why
 did Lenin pick Stalin Stalin was a very effective organizer and the position wasan organizational position Stalin could
 get things done he would carry out assignments no matter how difficult hewouldn't complain that it was hard work
 or too much work he wouldn't go off womanizing and drinking and ignore hisresponsibilities Lenin chose Stalin
 among other options because he thought Stalin was the better option once againhe wasn't choosing his successor because
 he didn't know he was gonna have this stroke Lenin had some serious illnessesbut he had never had a major stroke
 before so the choice was made based upon Stalin's organizational skills andpromise against the others who are in
 the regime now they can see more brilliant than Stalin but he was moreeffective and I'm not sure they were
 very brilliant well he was exceptionally

0:56:00
Speaker 1 :competent actually at the tasks for
 running a governor of the executive branch rate of a dictator yes he turned

0:56:07
Speaker 0 :out to be very adept at being a dictator
 and so if he had been chosen by Lenin and had not been very good he would havebeen pushed aside by others you can get
 a position by accident you can be named because you're someone's friend orsomeone's relative but to hold that
 position to hold that position in difficult circumstances and then tobuild effectively a superpower on all
 that bloodshed right you have to be skilled in some way it can't be just theaccident that brings you to power
 because if accident brings you to power it won't lastjust like we discovered with Putin he
 had some qualities that we didn't foresee at the beginning and he's beenable to hold power not just be named and
 now Putin and Stalin are very different people these are very different regimesI wouldn't put them in the same sentence
 my point is not that one resembles the other my point is that when people cometo power for contingent reasons they
 don't stay in power unless they're able to manage it and Stalin was able tobuild a personal dictatorship inside
 that dictatorship he was cunning he was ruthless and he was a workaholic he wasvery diligent he had a phenomenal memory
 and so he could remember people's names and faces and events and this was veryadvantageous for him as he built the
 machine that became the Soviet state and bureaucracy one of the things maybe you

0:57:50
Speaker 1 :can correct me if I'm wrong with you've
 made me realize is this wasn't some kind of manipulative personality trying togain more power solely like kind of an
 evil picture of a person but he truly believed in communism the the you knowas far as I can understand again you can
 correct me if I'm wrong but he wanted to build a better world by build by havinginfusing communism into into into the
 country and perhaps into the the the whole world so maybe my question iswhat role does communism as an idea as
 an ideology playing all of this in his rise to power in the people of the timein the Russian people actually just the
 whole 20th century you're right

0:58:42
Speaker 0 :Stalin was a true believer and this is
 very important he was also hungry for power and forpersonal power but just as you said not
 for powers sake not only for power he was interested in enacting communism inreality and also in building a powerful
 state he was a statist a traditional Russian statist in the Imperial senseand this won him a lot of followers the
 fact that they knew he was a hardcore true believing communist won him a lotof followers among the communists and
 the fact that he was a hardcore defender of Russian state interests now in theSoviet guys also won him a lot of
 followers sometimes those groups overlapped theCommunists and the Russian Patriots and
 sometimes they were completely different groups but both of them shared anadmiration for Stalin's a dedication to
 those goals and his abilities to enact them and so it's very important tounderstand that however thirsty he was
 for power and he was very thirsty for power that he was also driven by idealsnow I don't necessarily think that
 everyone around Stalin shared those ideals we have to be careful not to makeeverybody into a communist true believer
 not to make everybody into a great statist Russian patriot but they werewidespread and powerful attractions for
 a lot of people and so Stalin's ability to communicate to people those that hewas dedicated to those pursuits and his
 ability to drive towards them were part of his appeal however he alsoresorted to manipulation
 he also resorted to violence he lied he spoke out of all sides of his mouth heslandered other people he sabotaged
 potential rivals he used every underhanded method and then some inorder to build his personal dictatorship
 now he justified this as you said by appeals to communism and to Sovietfather himself as well too to himself


1:01:10
Speaker 1 :

1:01:10
Speaker 0 :and to others and so he justified it in
 his own mind and to others but certainly any means right were were acceptable tohim to achieve these ends and he
 identified his personal power with communism and with Russian glory in theworld so he felt that he was the only
 one who could be trusted who could be relied upon to build these things now weput ourselves back in that time period
 the Great Depression was a very difficult time for the capitalist systemthere was mass unemployment a lot of
 hardship fascism Nazism Japan Imperial Japan there were a lot of associationsthat were negative with the kind of
 capitalist system that was not a hundred percent not a monolith but had a lot ofauthoritarian incarnations there was
 imperialism colonies that even the democratic rule of law capitalist stateshad non democratic non rule of law
 colonies under their rule so the image and reality of capitalism during thattime period between World War one and
 World War two was very different from how it would become later and so in thattime period in that interwar conjuncture
 after World War one before World War two communism held some appeal inside theSoviet Union for sure but even outside
 the because the image and reality ofcapitalism disappointed many people now
 in the end communism was significantly worse many more victims and the systemof course would eventually implode but
 nonetheless there were real problems that communism tried to address itdidn't solve those problems it was not a
 solution but it didn't come out of nowhere it came out of the context ofthat inner war period and so Stalin's
 rule some people saw it as potentially a better option than imperialism fascismand Great Depression having said that
 they were wrong it turned out that Stalin wasn't a better alternative tomarkets and private property and rule of
 law and democracy however that didn't become clearer to people until afterWorld War two after Nazism had been
 defeated Imperial Japan had been defeatedfascist Italy had been defeated and
 decolonization had happened around the world and there was a middle classeconomic boom in the period from the
 late 40s through the 70s that created a kind of mass middle class in manysocieties so capitalism rose from the
 ashes as it were and this changed the game for Stalin and communism communismis about an alternative to capitalism
 and if that alternative is not superior there's no reason for communism to existbut if capitalism is in foul odor if
 people have a bad opinion a strong critique of capitalism that can beappealed to alternatives and that's kind
 of what happened with Stalin's rule but after World War two the context changeda lot capitalism was very different much
 more successful not a non-violence compared to what it was in the interwarperiod and the Soviet Union had a tough
 time competing against that new context now today we see similarly that theimage and reality of capitalism is on
 the question again which leads some people to find an answer in socialism asan alternative so you just kind of


1:05:20
Speaker 1 :painted a beautiful picture of
 comparison this is the way we think about ideologies because we is what'sworking better do you separate in your
 mind the ideals of communism to the Stalinist implementation of communismand again capitalism and American
 implementation of capitalism and as we look at now the 21st century where yesthis idea you know of socialism being a
 potential political system that we would or economic system would operate underin the United States rising up again as
 an idea so how do we think about that again in the 21st century about theseideas fundamental deep ideas of
 communism capitalism yeah so in the

1:06:08
Speaker 0 :Marxist schema there was something
 called feudalism which was supposedly destroyed by the bourgeoisie who createdcapitalism and then the working class
 was supposed to destroy capitalism and create socialism but socialism wasn'tthe end stage the end stage was going to
 be communism so that's why the communist party in the Soviet Union first builtsocialism transcending capitalism the
 next stage was socialism and the end game the final stage was communism sotheir version of socialism was derived
 from Marx and Marx argued that the problem was capitalism had been verybeneficial for a while it had produced
 greater wealth and greater opportunities and feudalism had but then it had cometo serve only the narrow interests of
 the so called booze huazi or the capitalists themselves and so forHumanity's sake the universal class the
 working class needed to overthrow capitalistin order for greater productivity
 greater wealth to be produced for all of humanity to flourish and on a higherlevel so you couldn't have socialism
 unless you destroyed capitalism so that meant no markets no private property noso-called Parliament's or bourgeois
 Parliament's as they were called so you got socialism in Marxist schema bytranscending by eliminating capitalism
 now Marx also called for freedom he said that this elimination of markets andprivate property and bourgeois
 Parliament's would produce greater freedom in addition to greater abundancehowever everywhere this was tried it
 produced tyranny and mass violence death and shortages everywhere it was triedthere's no exception in historical terms
 and so it's very interesting Marx insisted that capitalism had to beeliminated
 you couldn't have markets markets were chaos you needed planningyou couldn't have wait a hiring of wage
 labor that was wage slavery now you couldn't have private property becausethat was a form of theft so in the
 Marxist scheme somehow you were going to eliminate capitalism and get to freedomit turned out you didn't get to freedom
 so then people said well you can't blame Marx because he said we needed freedomhe was Pro freedom so it's kind of like
 dropping a nuclear bomb you say you're gonna drop a nuclear bomb but you wantto minimize civilian casualties
 so the dropping of the nuclear bomb is the elimination of markets privateproperty in Parliament's but you're
 going to bring freedom or you're going to minimize civilian casualties so youdrop the nuclear bomb you eliminate the
 capitalism and you get famine deportation no constraints on executivepower and not abundance but shortages
 and people say well that's not what I mark said that's not what I saidI said I wanted to minimize civilian
 casualties the nuclear bomb goes off and there's mass civilian casualties and youkeep saying but I said drop the bomb but
 minimize civilian casualties so that's where we are that's history notphilosophy yeah
 I'm speaking about historical examples all the cases that we have Mark's wasnot a theorist of inequality Marx was a
 theorist of alienation of dehumanization of fundamental constraints or what hecalled fetters on productivity and on
 wealth which he all attributed to capitalism Marx wasn't bothered byinequality he was bothered by something
 deeper something worse right those socialists who figured this out whounderstood that if you drop the nuclear
 bomb there was no way to minimize civilian casualties those socialists whocame to understand that if you
 eliminated capitalism markets private property and Parliament's if youeliminated that you wouldn't get freedom
 those Marxists those socialists became what we would call Social Democrats orpeople who would use the state to
 regulate the market not to eliminate the market they would use the state toredistribute income not to destroy
 private property in markets and so this in the Marxist schema was apostasybecause they were accepting markets and
 private property they were accepting alienation and wage slavery they wereaccepting capitalism in principle what
 they wanted to fix it they wanted to ameliorate they wanted to regulate andso they became what was denounced as
 revision not true Marxists not realrevolutionaries but parliamentary Road
 parliamentarians we know this as normal politics normal social democraticpolitics from the European case are from
 the American case but they are not asking to eliminate capitalism blamingcapitalism blaming markets and private
 property so this rift among the Socialists the ones who are forelimination of capitalism transcending
 capitalism otherwise you could never ever get to abundance and freedom in theMarxist schema versus those who accept
 capitalism but want to regulate and redistribute that rift on the left hasbeen with us almost from the beginning
 it's a kind of civil war on the left between the Leninists and SocialDemocrats or the revisionists as they're
 known pejoratively by the Leninists we have the same confusion today in theworld today where people also cite Marx
 saying capitalism is a dead end and we need to drop that nuclear bomb and getfreedom get no civilian casualties
 versus those who say yes there are inequities there's a lack of equality ofopportunity there are many other issues
 that we need to deal with and we can fix those issues we can regulate we canredistribute I'm not advocating this as
 a political position I'm not taking a political position myself I'm justsaying that there's a confusion on the
 left between those who accept capitalism and want to regulate it versus those whothink capitalism is inherently evil and
 if we eliminate it we'll get to a better world when in fact history shows that ifyou eliminate capitalism you get to a
 worse world the problems might be real but the solutions are worse from

1:13:54
Speaker 1 :history's lessons now we have deep
 painful lessons but there's not many of them you know our history isrelatively short as a human species do
 we have a good answer on the left of Leninist Marxist versus social democratversus capitalism versus any anarchy you
 know do have sufficient samples from history to make better decisions aboutthe future of our politics and economics


1:14:26
Speaker 0 :for sure we have the American Revolution
 which was a revolution not about class not about workers not about a so-calleduniversal class of the working class
 elimination of capitalism markets and the bourgeoisie but was about thecategory citizen it was about universal
 humanity where everyone in theory could be part of it as a citizen therevolution fell short of its own ideals
 not everyone was a citizen right for example if you didn't own property youwere a male but didn't own property you
 didn't have full rights of a citizen if you were a female whether you ownproperty or not you weren't a full
 citizen if you were imported from Africa against your will you were a slave andnot a citizen and so not everyone was
 afforded the rights in actuality that were declared in principle however overtime the category citizen could expand
 and slaves could be emancipated and they could get the right to vote they couldbecome citizens non-property owning
 males could get the right to vote and become full citizens females could getthe right to vote and become full
 citizens in fact eventually my mother was able to get a credit card in her ownname in the 1970s without my father
 having to co-sign the paperwork I took a long time but nonetheless the categorycitizen can expand and it can become a
 universal category so we have that the citizen universal humanity model ofthe American Revolution which was deeply
 flawed at the time it was introduced but fixable over time we also had thatseparation of powers and constraint on
 executive power that we began this conversation with that was alsoinstitutionalized in the American
 Revolution because they were afraid of tyranny they were afraid ofunconstrained executive power so they
 built a system that would contain that constrain it institutionally notcircumstantially so that's a great gift
 within that Universal category of citizen which has over time come closerto fulfilling its original promise and
 within those institutional constraints that separation of powers constraint onexecutive power within that we've
 developed what we might call normal politics left-right politics people canbe in favor of redistribution and
 government action and people can be in favor of small government hands offgovernment no redistribution or less
 redistribution that's the normal left-right political spectrum where yourespect the institutions and separation
 of powers and you respect the universal category of citizenship and equalitybefore the law and everything else I
 don't see any problems with that whatsoeverI see that as a great gift not just to
 this country but around the world and other places besides the United Stateshave developed this the problems arise
 at the extremes the far left and the far right that don't recognize thelegitimacy either of capitalism or of
 democratic rule of law institutions and they want to eliminate constraints onexecutive power they want to control the
 public sphere or diminish the Independence of the media they want totake away
 markets or private property and redistribution becomes something biggerthan just redistribution it becomes
 actually that original Marxist idea of transcending capitalism so I'm notbothered by the left or the right I
 think they're normal and we should have that debate where a gigantic diversecountry of many different political
 points of view I'm troubled only by the extremes that are against the systemcost system that want to get rid of it
 and supposedly that will be the right path to the future history tells us thatthe far left and the far right are wrong
 about that but once again this doesn't mean that you have to be a socialdemocrat you could be a libertarian you
 could be a conservative you could be a centrist you could be conservative onsome issues and liberal on other issues
 all of that comes under what I would presume to be normal politics and I seethat as the important corrective
 mechanism normal politics and market economies non monopolistic open free anddynamic market economies I don't like
 concentrations of power politically and I don't like concentrations of powereconomically I like competition in the
 political realm I like competition in the economic realm this is not perfectit's constantly needs to be protected
 and reinvented and there are flaws that are fundamental and need to be adjustedand addressed and everything else
 especially equality of opportunity equality of outcome is unreachable andis a mistake because it produces
 perverse and unintended consequences equality of outcome attempts attempts tomake people equal on the outcome side
 what attempts to make them more equal on the front end on the opportunity sidethat's really really important for a
 healthy society that's where we've fallen downour schools are not providing equality
 of opportunity for the majority of people in all of our school systems andso I see problems there I see a need to
 invest in ourselves invest in infrastructure invest in human capitalcreate greater equality of opportunity
 but also to make sure that we have good governance because governance is thevariable that enables you to do all
 these other things I've washed quite a

1:21:12
Speaker 1 :bit returning back to Putin I've watched
 quite a few interviews and with Putin in conversations you know especiallybecause I speak Russian fluently I can
 understand often the translations lose a

1:21:27
Speaker 0 :lot I am I find the man putting morality


1:21:30
Speaker 1 :aside very deep and interesting and I
 found almost no interview with him to be to get at that depth I was I was veryhopeful for the Oliver Stone documentary
 and with him and to me because I deeply respect our stone as a filmmaker ingeneral but it was a complete failure in
 my eyes that interview the the lack of it I mean I suppose you could toss it upto a language barrier but a complete
 lack of diving deep into the person as what I saw my question is a strange onebut if you were to sit down with Putin
 and have a conversation or perhaps if you're sa-do's Saddam was Stalin andhave a conversation what kind of
 questions would you ask well this wouldn't be televised unless you want itto be so this is only you so you're
 allowed to ask about some of the questions that are sort of not sociallyacceptable meaning putting morality
 aside getting into depth of the human character what would you ask

1:22:52
Speaker 0 :so once again they're very different
 personalities and very different time periods in very different regimes sowhat I would talk to Stalin about and
 Putin about her are not in the same category necessarily so let's take Putinso I would ask him where he thinks this
 is going where he thinks Russia's going to be in 25 years or 50 years what's thelong-term vision what does he anticipate
 the current trends are going to produce is he under the illusion that Russia ison the up swing that things are actually
 going pretty well that in 25 years Russia is going tostill be a great power with a tremendous
 dynamic economy and a lot of high tech and a lot of human capital and wonderfulinfrastructure and a very high standard
 of living and a secure secure borders and sense of security at home see thinkthe current path is leading in that
 direction and if not if he's if he understands that the current trajectorydoes not provide for those kinds of
 circumstances does it bother him it does he worryabout that does he care about the future
 25 or 50 years from now deep down what

1:24:21
Speaker 1 :do you think is the answer either the
 honesty either he thinks he's on that

1:24:23
Speaker 0 :trajectory already or he doesn't care
 about that long-term trajectory so that's the mystery for me with him he'sclever
 he has tremendous sources of information he has great experience now as a worldleader having served for effectively
 longer than laying at Brezhnev's long 18 year reign and so Putin has accumulateda great deal of experience at the
 highest level compared to where he started and so I'm interested tounderstand how he sees this long term
 evolution or non evolution of Russia and and whether he believes he's gotthem on the right trajectory or whether
 if he doesn't believe that he cares I have no idea because I've never spokento him about this but I would love to
 hear the answer sometimes you have to ask questions not directly like that butyou have to come a little bit sideways
 you can elicit answers from people by making them feel comfortable in comingsideways with them on just a quick


1:25:31
Speaker 1 :question so that's talking about Russia
 yeah Putin's role in Russia do you think it's interesting to ask and you couldsay the same for Stalin the more
 personal question of how do you feel yourself about this whole thing aboutyour life about your legacy looking at
 the person that's one of the most powerful and important people in thehistory of civilization both Putin and
 Stalin you could argue yeah

1:26:04
Speaker 0 :once you experience power at that level
 it becomes something that's almost necessary for you as a human being it'sa drug it's an aphrodisiac it's a
 feeling you know you go to the gym to exercise and the endorphins thechemicals get released and even if
 you're tired or you're sore you get this massive chemical change which is hasvery dynamic effects on how you feel and
 the kind of level of energy you have for the rest of the day and if you do thatfor a long time and then you don't do it
 for a while you're like a drug addict not getting your fix you miss it yourbody misses that release of endorphins
 to a certain extent that's how power works for people like Putin that's howpower works for people who run
 universities or our secretaries of state or run corporations fill in the blank inwhatever ways power is exercised it
 becomes almost the drug for people it becomes something that's difficult forthem to give up it becomes a part of who
 they are it becomes necessary for their sense of self and well-being thegreatest people the people I admire the
 most are the ones that can step away from power can give it up can give upthe drug can be satisfied
 and be stronger even by walking away from continued power when they had theoption to continue alright so with a
 person like Putin once again I don't know him personally so I have no basisto judge this this is a general
 statement observable with many people and in historical terms with a personlike Putin who's exercised this much
 power for this long it's something that becomes a part of who you are and youhave a hard time imagining yourself
 without it you begin to conflate your personal power with the well-being ofthe nation you begin to think that the
 more power you have the better off the country is this conflation you begin tobe able to not imagine you can no longer
 imagine what it would be like just to be an ordinary citizen or an ordinaryperson running a company even something
 much smaller than a country so I anticipate that without knowing for surethat he would be in that category of
 person but you'd want to explore that with questions with him about so what'shis day look like from beginning to end
 just take me through a typical day of yourswhat are you doing a day how does it
 start what are the ups what are the downs what are the parts of the day youlook forward to the most what are the
 parts of the day you don't look forward to that much what do you consider a goodday
 what do you consider a bad day yeah how do you know that what you're doing ishaving the effects that you intend how
 do you follow up how do you gather the information the reaction how do you getpeople to tell you to your face things
 that they know are uncomfortable or that you might not want to hear those kind ofquestions


1:29:36
Speaker 1 :through that window through that kind of
 question you get a window into a man with power so let me ask about stallingbecause you've done more reason another
 amazing interview you've had the the introduction was that you knowmore about Stalin than Stalin himself
 you've done incredible amount of research on Stalin so if you could talkto him get sort of direct research what
 question did you ask of Stalin I have so

1:30:07
Speaker 0 :many questions I don't even know where I
 would begin the thing about studying a person like Stalin who's an immensecreature right he's exercising the power
 of life and death over hundreds of millions of people he's making decisionsabout novels and films and and turbines
 and submarines and and pacts with Hitler or deals with Churchill and Rooseveltand and occupation of Mongolia or
 occupation of North Korea he's making phenomenally consequential decisionsover all spheres of life all areas of
 Endeavour and over much of the globe much of the land mass of the earth andso what's that like does he sometimes
 reflect on the amount of power and responsibility he has that he canexercise does he sometimes think about
 what it means that a single person has that kind of power and does it have aneffect on his relations with others his
 sense of self the kinds of things he values in life does he sometimes thinkit's a mistake that he's accumulated
 this much power does he sometimes wish he had a simpler life or is he onceagain so drunk so enamored so caught up
 with chemically and spiritually with exercising this kind of power that hecouldn't live without it and then what
 were you thinking I would ask him in certain decisions that he made what wereyou thinking on certain dates and
 certain circumstances where you made a decision and could have made a differentdecision can you recall your thought
 processes can you bring this Beck was at seat-of-the-pants was itsomething you'd been planning did you
 just improvise or did you have a strategy what were you guided by whoseexamples did you look to when you picked
 up these books that you read and you read the books and you made pencil marksin them is it because you absorbed the
 lesson there or did it really not become a permanent lesson and was justsomething that you checked and it was
 like a reflex so I have many specific questions about many specific events andpeople and circumstances that I have
 tried to figure out with the surviving source materials that we have inabundance but I would still like to
 delve into his mindset and reconstruct his mind the closer you get to Stalin insome ways the more elusive he can become
 and especially around World War two

1:33:01
Speaker 1 :you've already illuminated a lot of
 interesting aspects about Stalin's role in the war but it would be interestingto ask even more questions about how
 seat-of-the-pants or deliberate some of the decisions have been if I could askjust one quick question one last quick


1:33:20
Speaker 0 :question and you're constrained in time


1:33:22
Speaker 1 :and answering it do you think there will
 always be evil in the world do you think there will always be war

1:33:31
Speaker 0 :unfortunately yes there are conflicting
 interests conflicting goals that people have most of the time those conflictscan be resolved peacefully that's where
 we build strong institutions to resolve different interests and conflictspeacefully but the fact the enduring
 fact of conflicting interests and conflicting desires that can never bechanged so the job that we have for
 Humanity's sake is to make those conflicting interests thoseconflicting desires to make them to put
 them in a context where they can be resolved peacefully and not in azero-sum fashion so we can't get there
 on the global scale so there's always gonna be the kind of conflict thatsometimes gets violent what we don't
 want is a conflict among the strongest powers great power conflict isunbelievably bad there are no words to
 describe at least 55 million people died in World War two if we have a world war3 a war between the United States and
 China or whatever it might be who knows what the number could be a hundred andfifty five million two hundred and fifty
 five million five hundred and fifty five million I don't even want to think aboutit and so it's horrible when wars break
 out in the humanitarian catastrophes for example Yemen and Syria and severalother places I could name today it's
