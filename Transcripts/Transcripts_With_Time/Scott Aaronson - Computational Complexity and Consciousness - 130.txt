Speaker 0 :the following is the conversation with
 scott anderson his second time on the podcasthe is a professor at ut austin director
 of the quantum information center and previously a professor at mitlast time we talked about quantum
 computing this time we talk about computation complexityconsciousness
 and theories of everything i'm recording this introas you may be able to tell in a
 very strange room in the middle of the nighti'm not really sure how i got here or
 how i'm going to get out but hunters thompson saying i think appliesto today and the last few days and
 actually the last couple of weeks lifeshould not be a journey to the grave
 with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved bodybut rather to skid and broadside in a
 cloud of smoke thoroughly used up totally worn out

0:01:04
Speaker 1 :and loudly proclaiming wow


0:01:07
Speaker 0 :what a ride so i figured whatever i'm up
 to here and yes lots of wine is involved i'mgonna have to improvise
 hence this recording okay quick mention of each sponsorfollowed by some thoughts related to the
 episode first sponsor is simply safe a home security company i use to monitorand protect my apartment
 though of course i'm always prepared with afallback plan as a man in this world
 must always be second sponsor is

Speaker 0 :not just by doing david goggins like
 physical challenges like i seem to do on occasion pleasecheck out these sponsors in the
 description to get a discount and

0:02:21
Speaker 1 :to support the podcast as a side note
 let me say that this is the second time

0:02:25
Speaker 0 :i recorded a conversation
 outdoors the first one was with stephen wolframwhen it was actually sunny out in this
 case it was raining which is why i found a covered outdoorpatio
 but i learned a valuable lesson which is thatraindrops can be quite loud on the hard
 metal surface of a patio cover i did my best with the audioi hope it still sounds okay to you i'm
 learning always improving in fact as scott says if you always winthen you're probably doing something
 wrong to be honest i get pretty upset with myself when i failsmall or big but i've learned that this
 feeling is priceless it can be fuel when channeled intoconcrete plans


0:03:13
Speaker 1 :of how to improve so if you enjoy this

 and now here's my conversation with scotterinson let's start with the most absurd
 question but i've read you write some fascinating stuff about it so uh let'sgo there
 are we living in a simulation what

0:03:38
Speaker 1 :difference does it make lex
 i mean i'm serious what difference

0:03:43
Speaker 0 :because if we are
 living in a simulation it raises the questionhow real does something have to be in
 stimulation for in it to be sufficiently immersive for us humans but

0:03:54
Speaker 1 :i mean even in principle how could we
 ever know if we were in one right a perfect simulation by definitionis something that's indistinguishable
 from the real thing well we didn't say

0:04:03
Speaker 0 :anything about perfect it could be


0:04:04
Speaker 1 :no no that's that's right well if it was
 an imperfect simulation if we could hack ityou know find a bug in it then that
 would be one thing right if if this was like the matrix and therewas a way for me to
 you know do flying kung fu moves or something by hacking the simulationwell then you know we would have to
 cross that bridge when we came to it wouldn't weright i mean at that point you know i
 it's it's uh hard to see the differencebetween that and just uh
 uh what people would ordinarily refer to as a world with miracles

0:04:37
Speaker 0 :you know uh what about from a different
 perspective thinking about the universe as a computation like a program runningon a computer
 that's kind of a neighboring concept it

0:04:45
Speaker 1 :is it is an interesting and reasonably
 well-defined question to ask is the world computable you know youknow does the world satisfy
 what we would call in cs the the church touring thesisyeah that is you know uh could we take
 any physical system and simulate it to uh you know anydesired precision by a touring machine
 you know given the appropriate input data right andso far i think the indications are
 pretty strong that our world does seem to satisfy thechurch-touring thesis
 uh at least if it doesn't then we haven't yet discovered why notuh but now does that mean that our
 universe is a simulation well you know that word seems to suggestthat there is some other
 larger universe in which it is running right rightand the problem there is that if the
 simulation is perfect then we're never going to be able to getany direct evidence
 about that other universe you know we will only be able to seeuh the effects of the computation that
 is running in this universe

0:05:50
Speaker 0 :well let's imagine an analogy let's
 imagine a pc a personal computer a computeris it possible with the advent of
 artificial intelligence for the computer to look outside ofitself to see
 to understand its creator i mean that's a simple is that is that a ridiculous

0:06:11
Speaker 1 :connection well i mean with the
 computers that we actually have i mean first of all uh we we all knowthat uh humans have done an imperfect
 job of you know enforcing the abstraction boundaries ofcomputers
 right like you may try to confine some program to a playpenbut you know as soon as there's one uh
 uh memory allocation error in in the cprogram
 then the program has gotten out of that play pen and it can do whatever it wantsright this is how most hacks work you
 know viruses and worms and exploits and youknow you would have to imagine that
 an ai would be able to discover something like thatnow you know of course if we could
 actually discover some exploit of reality itself then you knowthen this whole
 i mean we we then in some sense we we wouldn't have to philosophize about thisright this would no longer be a
 metaphysical conversation right this would just but that's

0:07:12
Speaker 0 :the question is what is what would that


0:07:15
Speaker 1 :hack look like yeah well i have no idea
 i mean uh uh peter shore uh you know theyou know very famous person in quantum
 computing of course has a joked that uh maybe the reason why we haven'tyet
 you know integrated general relativity in quantum mechanicsis that you know the part of the
 universe that depends on both of them was thatwas actually left unspecified and if we
 ever tried to do an experiment uh involving the singularity of a blackhole or something like that
 then you know the universe would just uh generate an overflow erroror something right yeah we would just
 crash the universe now um you know the the the universe youknow has seemed to hold up pretty well
 for you know 14 billion years right so you know my uh you know uhoccam's razor kind of guess has to be
 that you know it will continue to hold up you know that the fact that we don'tknow the laws of physics
 governing some phenomenon is not a strong signthat probing that phenomenon is going to
 crash the universe right but you know of course i could be

0:08:22
Speaker 0 :wrong but do you think
 on the physics side of things you know there's been uhrecently a few folks eric weinstein
 and stephen wolfram that came out with a theory of everything i think there's ahistory of physicists dreaming and
 working on the unification of all the laws ofphysics do you think it's possible that
 once we understand uh more physics not necessarily theunification of the laws but just
 understand physics more deeply at the fundamental levelwe'll be able to start you know uh
 i mean part of this is humorous but uh lookingto see if there's any bugs in the
 universe that can be exploited for uh you know traveling at uhnot just speed of light but just
 traveling faster than our current uh spaceships can travel all that kindof stuff


0:09:10
Speaker 1 :well i mean to travel faster than our
 current spaceships could travel you wouldn't need to findany bug in the universe right the known
 laws of physics you know let us go much faster up to thespeed of light
 right and you know when people want to go faster than the speed of lightwell we actually know something about
 what that would entail namely that you know according torelativity
 that seems to entail communication backwards in timeokay so then you have to worry about uh
 close time like curves and all of that stuff so you know in some sense wewe sort of know the price that you have
 to pay for these things right understanding of physics that'sright that's right we can't
 you know say that they're impossible but we you know we know thatsort of a lot else in physics breaks
 right so uh now regarding uh eric weinstein and stephen wolfram like iwouldn't say that either of them has a
 theory of everything i would say that they haveideas that they hope
 you know could someday lead to a theory

0:10:12
Speaker 0 :of everything is that a worthy pursuit


0:10:13
Speaker 1 :well i mean certainly let's say by
 theory of everything you know we don't literally mean atheory of cats and
 of baseball and you know but we just mean it in thein the more limited sense of everything
 a fun a fundamental theory of physics right ofall of the
 fundamental interactions of physics of course such a theoryeven after we had it uh you know would
 would leave the entire question of all the emergentbehavior right
 you know to uh to be explored uh so it's so it's only everything for a specificdefinition of everything
 okay but in that sense i would say of course that's worth pursuingi mean that is the entire program of
 fundamental physics right all of my friends who do quantumgravity who do string theory who do
 anything like that that is what's motivating them yeah it's

0:11:03
Speaker 0 :it's funny though but
 i mean eric weinstein talks about this it is i don't know much about thephysics world but i know about the
 ai world it is a little it is a little bit taboouh to talk about agi for example on the
 ai side so really to talk aboutuh the big dream of the community i
 would say because it seems so far away it's almosttaboo to bring it up because
 uh you know it's seen as the kind of people that dream about creating a trulysuperhuman level intelligence that's
 really far out there people because we're not even close tothat and it feels like the same thing is
 true for the physics

0:11:43
Speaker 1 :community i mean stephen hawking
 certainly talked uh constantly about theory of everythingright uh uh uh you know i mean i mean
 people you know used those terms who were you know some of the most respectedpeople in the
 in the in the whole world of physics right but i mean i think thatthe distinction that i would make is
 that people might react badly if you use the term ina way that suggests
 that that you you know thinking about it for five minutes have come up with thismajor new insight about it yeah


0:12:14
Speaker 0 :right it's it's difficult stephen hawk
 is is a not a great example because i thinkyou can do whatever the heck you want
 when you get to that level and i certainly see like seeing yourfaculty you know
 that you know at that point that's the one of the nice things about gettingolder is you
 stop giving a damn but community as a wholethey tend to roll their eyes very
 quickly at stuff that's outside the quote-unquote mainstream well well let

0:12:41
Speaker 1 :me let me put it this way i mean if you
 asked you know ed whitton let's say who is you know you might consider theleader of the string community
 and thus you know very very mainstream in a certain sense buthe would have no hesitation in saying
 you know of course you know they're looking for a you knowuh uh you know a
 a a unified description of nature of you know of general relativity ofquantum mechanics of all the fundamental
 interactions of nature right now you know whether people wouldcall that a theory of everything whether
 they would use that that term that might vary you know lennysuskin would definitely have no problem
 telling you that you know if that's what we want right

0:13:22
Speaker 0 :for me who loves human beings in
 psychology it's kind of ridiculous to saya theory that unifies the laws of
 physics gets you to understand everything i would say you're not evenclose to understanding everything


0:13:36
Speaker 1 :yeah right well yeah i mean the word
 everything is a little ambiguous here right because you know and then peoplewill get into debates about
 you know reductionism versus emergentism and blah blah blahand so in in not wanting to say theory
 of everything people might just be trying to short-circuit that debateand say you know look you know yes we
 want a fundamental theory of you know the particles and interactions

0:14:02
Speaker 0 :of nature let me bring up the next topic
 that people don't want to mention although they're getting morecomfortable with it it's consciousness
 you mentioned that you have a talk on consciousnessthat i watched five minutes of but the
 internet connection was really bad

0:14:14
Speaker 1 :was this my talk about you know uh
 refuting the integrated information theoryyes which is a particular account of
 consciousness that yeah i think one can just show it doesn't work rightso let me much harder to say what does
 work what doesn't work yeah yeah

0:14:26
Speaker 0 :let me ask maybe it'd be nice to uh
 comment on you talk about also like the semi hardproblem of consciousness or like almost


0:14:35
Speaker 1 :hard pro or kind of hard pretty pretty


0:14:38
Speaker 0 :hard pretty hard one i think i call it
 so maybe can you uh talk about that uh their idea of umof the approach to modeling
 consciousness and why you don't find it convincingwhat is it first of all okay well so so


0:14:50
Speaker 1 :what what what i called the pretty hard
 problem of consciousness this is my term although many other people havesaid something equivalent to this okay
 uh but uh it's just you know the the problem of you know giving an account ofjust which physical systems are
 conscious and which are not or you know if there are degrees ofconsciousness then quantifying how
 conscious a given system is oh awesome so that's

0:15:17
Speaker 0 :the pretty hard


0:15:18
Speaker 1 :yeah that's what i mean that's it i'm


0:15:20
Speaker 0 :adopting it i love it that's a good


0:15:22
Speaker 1 :a good ring to it and so you know the
 infamous hard problem of consciousness is to explain howsomething like consciousness could arise
 at all you know in a material universe right or you know why does it ever feellike anything
 to to experience anything right and you know so i'm trying to distinguishfrom that problem right
 and say you know no okay i am i would merely settle for an accountthat could say you know is a fetus
 conscious you know if so at which trimester you know is a uhis a dog conscious you know what about a
 frog

0:15:58
Speaker 0 :right or or even as a precondition you
 take that both these things are conscioustell me which is more conscious yeah for


0:16:05
Speaker 1 :example yes
 yeah yeah i mean if consciousness is some multi-dimensional vector well justtell me in which respects these things
 are conscious and in which respect they aren'tright and you know and have some
 principled way to do it where you're not you know carving out exceptions forthings that you like or don't
 like but could somehow take a description of an arbitrary physicalsystem
 and then just based on the physical properties of that systemor the informational properties or how
 it's connected or something like that just in principle calculateyou know its degree of consciousness
 right i mean this this this would be the kind of thing that we would needyou know if we wanted to address
 questions like you know what does it take for a machine to beconscious right or when or
 you know when when when should we regard ais as being consciousum so now this iit
 this integrated information theory uh which has been put forward by uhgiulio tanoni and a bunch of his uh
 uh collaborators over the last decade or two uh this is noteworthy iguess
 as a direct attempt to answer that questionto you know answer the to address the
 pretty hard problem right and they give a uh a criterionthat's just based on how a system is
 connected so you so it's up to you to sort of abstract the system like abrain
 or a microchip as a collection of components that are connected to eachother by some
 pattern of connections you know and and to specify how the components caninfluence each other
 you know like where the inputs go you know where they affect the outputs butthen once you've specified that
 then they give this quantity that they call fee you know the greek letterphi and the definition of phi is
 actually changed over time it changes from one paper toanother
 but in all of the variations it involves something aboutwhat we in computer science would call
 graph expansion so basically what this means is thatthey want it uh
 in order to get a large value of fee uh it should not be possible totake your system and partition it into
 two components that are only weakly connected to eachother
 okay so whenever we take our system and sort oftry to split it up into two then there
 should be lots and lots of connections going between the two components

0:18:35
Speaker 0 :okay well i understand what that means
 on a graph do they formalize what uh how to construct such a graph ordata structure whatever
 uh or is this well one of the criticism uhi i've heard you kind of say is that a
 lot of the very interesting specifics are usually communicated throughlike natural language like like through
 words so it's like the details aren't always

0:18:58
Speaker 1 :well they well it's true i mean they
 they they they have nothing even resembling a derivationof this fee okay so what they do is they
 state a whole bunch of postulates you know axioms that they think thatconsciousness should satisfy
 and then there's some verbal discussion and then at some pointfee appears right right and this this
 was one the first thing that really made the hair stand on my neck to be honestbecause
 they are acting as if there is a derivation they're acting as if you knowyou're supposed to think that this is a
 derivation and there's nothing even remotely resemblinga derby they just pull the fee out of a


0:19:36
Speaker 0 :hat completely is one of
 the key criticisms to you is that details are missing or is that exactly

0:19:40
Speaker 1 :more fun
 that's not even the key criticism that's just that's just a side pointokay the the core of it is that i think
 that the you know that they want to say that a system is more conscious thelarger its value of fee
 and i think that that is obvious nonsense okay as soon as you think aboutit for like a minute
 as soon as you think about it in terms of could i construct a systemthat had an enormous value of fee like
 you know even larger than the brain has but that is just implementing an errorcorrecting code you know doing nothing
 that we would associate with you know intelligence orconsciousness or any of it
 the answer is yes it is easy to do that rightand so i wrote blog posts just making
 this point that yeah it's easy to do thatnow you know tanoni's response to that
 was actually kind of incredible right i mean i i admired it in a waybecause
 instead of disputing any of it he just bit the bulletin the sense you know he was one of the
 the uh the most uh audacious bullet bitings i've everseen in my career
 okay he said okay then fine you know this system that just appliesthis error correcting code it's
 conscious you know and if it has a much largervalue of fee then
 you or me it's much more conscious than you want meyou know you we just have to accept what
 the theory says because you know science is not about confirmingour intuitions it's about challenging
 them and you know this is what my theorypredicts that this thing is conscious
 and you know or super duper conscious andhow are you going to prove me wrong see
 i would

0:21:16
Speaker 0 :so the way i would argue against your
 blog post is i would say yes sure you're right ingeneral but
 for naturally arising systems developed through the process of evolution onearth
 the this rule of the larger fee being associated being associated with moreconsciousness is correct


0:21:34
Speaker 1 :yeah so that's not what he said at all
 right right because he wants this to be completely general

0:21:40
Speaker 0 :right so we can apply to even computers


0:21:41
Speaker 1 :yeah i mean i mean the whole interest of
 the theory is the you know the hope that it couldbe completely general apply to aliens to
 computers to uh uh animals coma patients to any of itright yeah and uh uh so so so he just
 said well you know uh scott is relying on hisintuition but you know i'm relying on
 this theory and you know to me it was almost likeyou know are we being serious here
 like like like you know like like okay yes in science we try to learn highlynon-intuitive things but what we do is
 we first test the theory on cases where wealready know the answer
 right like if if someone had a new theory of temperature rightthen you know maybe we could check that
 it says that boiling water is hotter than iceand then if it says that the sun is
 hotter than anything you know you've everexperienced then maybe we we trust that
 extrapolation right but like this this theory like if if youknow
 it it's now saying that you know a a gigantic grit like regular grid ofexclusive or gates
 can be way more conscious than a you know a personor than any animal can be you know even
 if it you know is you know is is is is souniform that it might as just well just
 be a blank wall right and and so now the point is ifthis theory is sort of getting wrong
 the question is a blank wall you know more conscious than a personthen i would say what is what is there
 for it to get right

0:23:16
Speaker 0 :so your sense is a blank wall uh
 is not more conscious than a human being

0:23:22
Speaker 1 :yeah i mean i mean i mean
 you could say that i am taking that as one of my axiomsi'm saying i'm saying that if if a
 theory of consciousness is is get getting that wrong thenwhatever it is talking about at that
 point i i i'm not going to call it consciousnessi'm going to use a different word you


0:23:41
Speaker 0 :have to use a different word i mean yeah
 it's all it's possible just like withintelligence that us humans conveniently
 define these very difficult to understand conceptsin a very human-centric way just like
 the touring test really seems to define intelligence as athing that's human-like


0:23:56
Speaker 1 :right but i would say that with any uh
 concept you know there's uh uh uhyou know like we we we first need to
 define it right and a definition is only a good definition if it matcheswhat we thought we were talking about
 you know prior to having a definition right yeahand i would say that you know
 uh fee as a definition of consciousness fails that test that is my argument

0:24:22
Speaker 0 :so okay let's so let's take a further
 step so you mentioned that the universe might beuh the touring machine so like it might


0:24:31
Speaker 1 :be computational or simulatable by one


0:24:31
Speaker 0 :anyway
 simulated by one so yeah do you what's your senseabout consciousness do you think
 consciousness is computation that we don't need to go to any placeoutside of the computable universe
 to uh you know to to understand consciousness to build consciousness tomeasure consciousness all those kinds of


0:24:54
Speaker 1 :things i don't know
 these are what uh you know have been called the the vertigonousquestions right there's the questions
 like like uh you know you get a feeling of vertigo andthinking about them right
 i mean i certainly feel like uh i am conscious in a way that is notreducible to computation
 but why should you believe me right i meanand and if you said the same to me then
 why should i believe you

0:25:19
Speaker 0 :but as computer scientists yeah i feel
 like a computer could be intel could achievehuman level intelligence
 but and that's actually a feeling and a hopethat's not a scientific belief it's just
 we've built up enough intuition the same kind of intuition you use in your blogit's you know that's what scientists do
 they i mean some of it is a scientific method but some of it is just damn goodintuition
 i don't have a good intuition about

0:25:45
Speaker 1 :consciousness yeah i'm not sure that
 anyone does or or has in the you know 2500 years that thesethings have been discussed lex


0:25:53
Speaker 0 :uh but do you think we will like one of
 the i got a chance to attend i can't wait to hear your opinionon this but attend the neuralink event
 and uh one of the dreams there is to uh you know basically push neuroscienceforward and the hope with neuroscience
 is that we can inspect the machinery from whichall this fun stuff emerges and see we're
 going to notice something special some special sauce from whichsomething like consciousness or
 cognition emerges

0:26:22
Speaker 1 :yeah well it's clear that we've learned
 an enormous amount about neuroscience we've learned an enormous amount aboutcomputation you know about machine
 learning about you'll know ai how to get it to work we've learneduh an enormous amount about the
 underpinnings of the physical world you know andyou know it from one point of view
 that's like an enormous distance that we've traveled along the road tounderstanding consciousness
 from another point of view you know the distance still to be traveled on theroad
 you know maybe seems no shorter than it was at the beginning yeahright so it's very hard to say i mean
 you know these are questions like like in in in sort oftrying to have a theory of consciousness
 there's sort of a problem where it feels likeit's not just that we don't know how to
 make progress it's that it's hard to specifywhat could even count as progress right
 because no matter what scientific theory someone proposedsomeone else could come along and say
 well you've just talked about the mechanism you haven't said anythingabout
 what breathes fire into the mechanism right really makes there's somethingthat it's like to be
 it right and that seems like an objection that you could always raiseyes no matter you know how much someone
 elucidated the details of how the brain works okay

0:27:35
Speaker 0 :let's go touring tests and love the
 prize i have this intuition call me crazy but wethat a machine to pass the touring test
 and is full whatever the spirit of it is we can talkabout how to formulate
 the perfect touring test that that machine has tobe conscious or we at least have to uh
 i have a very low bar of what consciousness is a dentisti tend to think that the emulation of
 consciousness is as good as consciousnessso like consciousness is just a dance a
 social a social uh shortcut like a nice usefultool
 but i tend to connect intelligence consciousness together so byby that do you uh maybe just
 to ask what uh what role does consciousness play do you think inpassing the touring test well look i


0:28:27
Speaker 1 :mean it's almost tautologically true
 that if we had a machine that passed the turing test then it would be emulatingconsciousness
 right so if your position is that you know emulation of consciousness isconsciousness
 then so you know by by definition any machine that passed the touring testwould be conscious
 but it's uh uh but i mean we know that you could say that you know that that isjust a way to rephrase the original
 question you know is an emulation of consciousnessyou know necessarily conscious right and
 you can you know i hear i'm not saying anything new thathasn't been
 debated ad nauseum in the literature okay butyou know you could uh imagine some very
 hard cases like imagine a machine that passed the touring test but it didso just
 by an enormous cosmological sized look-up tablethat just cached every possible
 conversation that could be had the old chinese roomwell well yeah yeah but but this is uh
 uh i mean i mean the chinese room actually would be doing some computationat least in searle's version right
 here i'm just talking about a table lookup okay nowit's true that for conversations of a
 reasonable length this you know lookup table would be soenormous that wouldn't even fit in the
 observable universe okay but supposing that youcould build a big enough look-up table
 and then just you know pass the touring test just by looking up what the personsaid
 right are you going to regard that as conscious okay

0:29:53
Speaker 0 :let me try to make this yeah yeah formal
 and then you can shut it down i think that the emulation of somethingis that something if there exists in
 that system a black box that's full of mystery so like

0:30:09
Speaker 1 :uh full of mystery to whom to uh human


0:30:11
Speaker 0 :in inspectors


0:30:13
Speaker 1 :so does that mean that consciousness is
 relative to the observer like could something be conscious for usbut not conscious for an alien that
 understood better what was happening inside the black box

0:30:24
Speaker 0 :yes so that if inside the black box is
 just a look-up table the alien that saw that would say thisis not conscious to us
 another way to phrase the black box is layers of abstractionwhich make it very difficult to see to
 the actual underlying functionality of the system and then weobserve just the abstraction
 and so it looks like magic to us but once we understand theinner machinery it stops being magic and
 so like that's a prerequisite is that you can'tknow
 how it works some part of it because then there has to be in our human minduh entry point for the magic
 so that that's that's a formal

0:31:04
Speaker 1 :definition of the system
 yeah well look i mean i i explored a view and this essay i wrotecalled the ghost and the quantum touring
 machine uh seven years ago that is uh related to that except that idid not want to
 have consciousness be relative to the observer right because i think thatyou know if consciousness means anything
 it is something that is experienced by the entity that is consciousright you know like i don't need you to
 tell me that i'm conscious right nor do you need me to to toto tell you that you are right so uh
 so but but basically what i explored there is you know are there uhaspects of a of a system like uh like a
 brain that uh that just could not be predictedeven with arbitrarily advanced future
 technologies yes because of chaos combined withquantum mechanical uncertainty
 you know and things like that i mean that that actually could be aa property of the brain you know if true
 that would distinguish it in a principled wayat least from any currently existing
 computer not from any possible computer

0:32:10
Speaker 0 :but from yeah yeah
 let's do a thought experiment so yeah if i gave youinformation that you're in the entire
 history of your life basically explain away free will with alook-up table say that
 this was all predetermined that everything you experienced has alreadybeen predetermined
 wouldn't that take away your consciousness wouldn't you yourself thatwouldn't
 experience of the world change for you in a way that's

0:32:37
Speaker 1 :you you can't well let me put it this
 way if you could do like in a greek tragedy where you know you would justwrite down a prediction for what i'm
 going to do and then maybe you put the prediction ina sealed box
 and maybe you know you you uh open it later and youshow that you knew everything i was
 going to do or you know of course the even creepier versionwould be you tell me the prediction
 and then i try to falsify it and my very effort to falsify it makes it come trueright but let's let's you know let's
 even forget that you know that version is as convenient as it is for fictionwriters right let's just
 let's just do the version where you put the prediction into a sealed envelopeokay but uh if you could reliably
 predict everything that i was going to doi'm not sure that that would destroy my
 sense of being conscious but i think it really would destroy mysense of having free will
 you know and much much more than any philosophical conversation couldpossibly do that
 right and so i think it becomes extremely interesting to askyou know could such predictions be done
 you know even in principle is it consistent with the laws ofphysics to make such predictions
 to get enough data about someone that you could actually generate suchpredictions without having to kill them
 in the process to you know slice their brain up into little sliversor something i mean
 theoretically possible right well um i don't know i mean i mean it might bepossible but only at the cost of
 destroying the person right i mean it depends on how low youhave to go
 in sort of the substrate like if there was a nicedigital abstraction layer if you could
 think of each neuron as a kind of transistorcomputing a digital function then you
 could imagine some nanorobots that would go in and wejust scan the state of each transistor
 you know of each neuron and then you know make a a good enoughcopy
 right but if it was actually important to get down to the molecularor the atomic level then you know
 eventually you would be up against quantum effects you would be up againstthe unclonability of quantum states
 so i think it's a question of uh how good of a replicahow good does the replica have to be
 before you're going to count it as actually a copy of youor as being able to predict your actions
 uh that's a totally open question then

0:34:54
Speaker 0 :

0:34:55
Speaker 1 :yeah yeah yeah and
 and especially once we say that well look maybe there's no way to preyou know to make a deterministic
 prediction because you know there's all there you know we know that there'snoise buffeting the brain around
 presumably even quantum mechanical uncertaintyyou know affecting the sodium ion
 channels for example whether they open or they closeum you know there's no reason why
 over a certain time scale that shouldn't be amplified just like we imaginehappens with the weather
 or with any other you know chaotic system uhso um so if if that stuff
 is is important right then uh then then you know we would say uh wellyou know you
 you you can't uh uh you know you're you're never going to be able to make anaccurate enough copy
 but now the hard part is well what if someone can make a copythat sort of no one else can tell apart
 from you right it says the same kinds of things thatyou would have said
 maybe not exactly the same things because we agree that there's noisebut it says the same kinds of things and
 maybe you alone would say no i know that that's not me you know it'sit doesn't share my
 i haven't felt my consciousness leap over to that other thingi still feel it localized in this
 version right then why should anyone else believe youwhat are your thoughts


0:36:17
Speaker 0 :i'd be curious you're a good person to
 ask which is uh penn rose's roger penrose's work onconsciousness
 saying that there you know there is some with axons and so on there might be somebiological places where quantum
 mechanics can come into play and through that create consciousnesssomehow yeah


0:36:36
Speaker 1 :okay well um uh familiar with his work
 of course you know i read penrose's books as a teenager they had ahuge impact on me
 uh uh five or six years ago i had the privilege to actually talk these thingsover with penrose you know at some
 length at a conference in minnesota and uh you know he is uh uh you know anamazing uh
 personality i admire the fact that he was even raising such uh audaciousquestions at all
 uh but you know to to to answer your question i think the first thing we needto
 get clear on is that he is not merely saying that quantum mechanics isrelevant to consciousness
 right that would be like um you know that would be tamecompared to what he is saying right he
 is saying that you know even quantum mechanics is notgood enough right if because if
 supposing for example that the brain were a quantum computermaybe that's still a computer you know
 in fact a quantum computer can be simulated by an ordinary computer itmight merely need
 exponentially more time in order to do so right so that's simply not goodenough for him
 okay so what he wants is for the brain to be a quantum gravitational computeror or uh he wants the brain to be
 exploiting as yet unknown laws of quantum gravityokay which would which would be
 uncomputable that's the key point okay yes yes thatwould be literally uncomputable
 and i've asked him you know to clarify this but uncomputableeven if you had an oracle for the
 halting problem or you know and and or you know as highup as you want to go and the sort of
 high the usual hierarchy of uncomputabilityhe wants to go beyond all of that okay
 so so you know just to be clear like youknow if we're keeping count of how many
 speculations you know there's probably like at leastfive or six of them right
 there's first of all that there is some quantum gravity theory that wouldinvolve this kind of
 uncomputability right most people who study quantum gravity would not agreewith that
 they would say that what we've learned you know what little we know aboutquantum gravity from the
 this ads cft correspondence for example has been very much consistent with thebroad idea of nature being computable
 right um but uh but all right but but supposing that he's right about thatthen you know
 what most physicists would say is that whatevernew phenomena there are in quantum
 gravity you know they might be relevant at the singularities of black holes theymight be relevant at the big bang
 uh they are plainly not relevant to something like the brain you knowthat is operating at ordinary
 temperatures you know with ordinary chemistry andyou know the the the physics underlying
 the brain they would say that we have you know thefundamental physics of the brain they
 would say that we've pretty much completely known for forgenerations now
 right uh because you know quantum field theory lets us sort ofparametrize our ignorance right i mean
 sean carroll has made this case and you know in great detail rightthat sort of whatever new effects are
 coming from quantum gravity you know they are sort of screened offby quantum field theory
 right and this is this bring you know brings us to the whole idea of effectivetheories
 right but that like we have you know that in like in the standard model ofelementary particles
 right we have a quantum field theory that seems totally adequate for all ofthe terrestrial phenomena
 right the only things that it doesn't you know explainare well first of all you know the
 details of gravity if you were to probe it like at a uh youknow extremes of you know
 curvature or like incredibly small distancesit doesn't explain dark matter it
 doesn't explain black hole singularities right but these are all very exoticthings very you know far removed from
 our life on earth right so for penrose to be right heneeds
 you know these phenomena to somehow affect the brain he needs the brain tocontain
 antenna that are sensitive to the black holeto this as yet unknown physics right and
 then he needs a modification of quantum mechanics okayso he needs
 quantum mechanics to actually be wrong okay he needsuh uh what what he wants is what he
 calls an objective reduction mechanism oran objective collapse so this is the
 idea that once quantum states get large enoughthen they somehow spontaneously collapse
 right that uh uh um you know and and this is an idea that lots of people haveexplored
 uh you know there's uh something called the grwproposal that tries to uh you know
 say something along those lines you know and these are theories that actuallymake testable predictions
 right which is a nice feature that they have but you know the very fact thatthey're testable may mean that in the
 uh you know in the in the coming decades we may well be able to test thesetheories and show that they're they're
 they're wrong right uh you know we may be able to testsome of penrose's ideas
 if not not his ideas about consciousness but at least his ideas that about anobjective collapse of quantum states
 right and people have actually like dick balmester have actually beenworking to try to do these experiments
 they haven't been able to do it yet to attest penrose's proposalokay but penrose would need more than
 just an objective collapse of quantum stateswhich would already be the biggest
 development in physics for a century since quantum mechanics itself okay hewould need
 for consciousness to somehow be able to influencethe direction of the collapse so that it
 wouldn't be completely random but that you know your dispositionswould somehow influence the quantum
 state to collapse more likely this way or thatway
 okay finally penrose you know says that all of thishas to be true because of an argument
 that he makes based on girdle's incompleteness theoremokay right now like i would say the
 overwhelming majority of computer scientists and mathematicianswho have thought about this i don't
 think that girdles and completeness theorem can do what he needs it to dohere right i don't think that that
 argument is sound okay but that is you know that is sort of thetower that you have to ascend to if
 you're going to go where penrose goes and the

0:43:05
Speaker 0 :intuition uses with uh yeah the
 completeness theorem is that basically that there's important stuff that's notcomputable


0:43:12
Speaker 1 :it's not just that because i mean
 everyone agrees that there are problems that are uncomputable right that's amathematical theorem
 right that but what penrose wants to say is that uhuh you know the um you know for example
 there are statements uh you know for you know given any uhformal system
 you know for doing math right there will be true statements of arithmeticthat that formal system you know if it's
 adequate for math at all if it's consistent and so on will not beable to prove
 uh a famous example being the statement that that system itself is consistentright no you know good formal system can
 actually prove its own consistency that can only be done from a strongerformal system which then can't prove its
 own consistency and so on forever okay that's gurdle'stheorem
 but now why is that relevant to uh consciousness right uh uh well you knowi mean i mean the the idea that it might
 have something to do with consciousness as an old onegirdle himself apparently thought that
 it didn't really um you know uh lucas uh uh um umthought so i think in the 60s and
 penrose is really just you know sort of updating what what uh uh what what theyand others had said
 i mean you know the idea that girdle's theorem could have something to do withconsciousness was
 you know um in in 1950 when alan turing wrote his articleuh about the touring test he already you
 know was writing about that as like an oldand well-known idea and as one that he
 was as a wrong one that he wanted to dispense with okay butthe basic problem with this idea is you
 know penrose wants to say that uh and and all of his predecessorsyour you know want to say
 that you know even though you know this given formal system cannotprove uh its own consistency we
 as humans sort of looking at it from the outsidecan just somehow see its consistency
 right and the you know the rejoinder to thatyou know from the very beginning has
 been well can we really yeah i mean maybe or maybe maybe youknow maybe maybe he
 penrose can but you know can the rest of usright uh and you know i i noticed that
 that um you know i mean it is perfectlyplausible to imagine
 a computer that could say you know it would not be limited to working within asingle formal system
 right they could say i am now going to adopt the hypothesisthat this that my formal system is
 consistent right and i'm now going to see what can be done from that strongervantage point
 and and so on and you know when i'm going to add new axioms to my systemtotally plausible there's absolutely
 gerdle's theorem has nothing to say aboutagainst an ai that could repeatedly add
 new axioms all it says is that there is no absoluteguarantee
 that when the ai adds new axioms that it will always be rightright okay and you know and that's of
 course the point that penrose pounces on but the reply is obvious and you knowit's one that that alan turing made 70
 years ago name we we don't have an absoluteguarantee that we're right when we add a
 new axiom right we never have and plausibly wenever will


0:46:29
Speaker 0 :so on alan turing you took part in the
 lobner prize

0:46:32
Speaker 1 :uh uh not really no i didn't i mean
 there was this uh uh kind of ridiculous claim that wasmade uh
 some almost a decade ago about an a chat bot called eugene goose

0:46:45
Speaker 0 :i guess you didn't participate as a
 judge in the lobner prize i didn't but you participated as a judge in thati guess it was an
 exhibition event or something like that or was eugene uh

0:46:56
Speaker 1 :eugene gusman that was just me writing a
 blog post because some journalists called me to ask about it did you everchat with him i thought
 i did chat with eugene gooseman i mean it was available on the web the chatoh interesting i didn't so yeah so all
 that happened was that uh so you know a bunch of journalistsstarted writing breathless articles
 about you know an a you know first uh chatbot that passes the touring testright and it was this thing called
 eugene guzman that was supposed to simulate a 13 yearold boy
 and um you know and apparently someone had donesome tests where you know people
 couldn't you know you know were less than perfect let'ssay distinguishing it from a human
 and they said well if you look at touring's paperand you look at you know the percentages
 that he that he talked about then you know it seemed like we're past thatthreshold
 right and you know i had a sort of you know different way to look at itinstead of the legalistic way
 like let's just try the actual thing out and let's see what it can do withquestions like you know is mount everest
 bigger than a shoebox okay or just you know like the mostobvious questions right and then and you
 know and the answer is well it just kind of parries you becauseit doesn't know what you're talking
 about right

0:48:12
Speaker 0 :so just clarify exactly in which way
 they're obvious they're obvious in the sense that you convert thesentences
 into the meaning of the objects they represent and then do some basicobvious we mean your common sense
 reasoning with the objects that the sentences

0:48:29
Speaker 1 :represent uh right right it was not able
 to answer you know or even intelligently respondto basic common sense questions but let
 me say something stronger than that there was a famous chatbot in the 60scalled eliza
 right that you know that managed to actually foolyou know a lot of people right or people
 would pour their hearts out into this elisa because it simulated atherapist
 right and most of what it would do is it would just throw back at you whateveryou said
 right and this turned out to be incredibly effectiveright maybe you know therapists know
 this this is you know one of their tricksbut uh it um um you know it it really
 had some people convinced uh but you know this this thing was justlike i think it was literally just a few
 hundred lines of lisp code right it was not only wasit not intelligent it wasn't
 especially sophisticated it was like a it was a simple little hobbyist programand eugene gusman from what i could see
 was not a significant advance compared touh eliza right so so this is and and
 that was that was really the point i was makingand this was
 you know you didn't in some sense you didn't need a likea computer science professor to sort of
 say this like anyone who was looking at it and whojust had
 you know an ounce of sense could have said the same thingright well but because you know these
 journalists were call you know calling me you know like the first thingi said was
 uh well you know no you know i i'm a quantum computing person i'm not an aiperson you know you shouldn't ask me
 then they said look you can go here and you can try it out i said all rightall right so i'll try it out um but now
 you know this whole discussion i mean it got awhole lot more interesting in just the
 last few months

0:50:16
Speaker 0 :yeah i'd love to hear your thoughts
 about gpt yeah yeah yeah

0:50:18
Speaker 1 :in the last few months we've had you
 know we've we've the world has now seen a chat engine ora text engine
 i should say called gpt-3 um that you know i think it it's still youknow it does not pass
 a touring test you know there are no real claims that it passes the touringtest
 right you know this is comes out of the group at open aiand you know they're you know they've
 been relatively careful and what they've claimed about the systembut i think this this this
 uh as clearly as eugene gusman was not in advance over elizait is equally clear that this is a major
 advance over over over eliza or really over anything thatthe world has seen before
 uh this is a text engine that can come up with kind of on topic you knowreasonable sounding completions to just
 about anything that you ask you can ask it to write a poem abouttopic
 x in the style of poet y and it will have a go at that yeah andit will do you know
 not a perf not a great job not an amazing jobbut you know a passable job you know
 definitely you know as as good as you knowyou know in in many cases i would say
 better than i would have done right uh you know you can ask it towrite you know an
 essay like a student essay about pretty much any topic and it will get somethingthat i am pretty sure
 would get at least a b minus you know in my most you knowhigh school or even college classes
 right and you know in some sense you know the way that it did this theway that it achieves this
 um you know scott alexander of the you know the muchmourned blog slate star codex had a
 wonderful way of putting it he said that they basically just ground up the entireinternet into a slurry
 okay yeah and you know and i i to tell you the truth i had wondered for a whilewhy nobody had tried that
 right like why not write a chat bot by just doing deep learning over a corpusconsisting of the entire web
 right and and so so so uh now they finally have done thatright and you know the results are are
 very impressive you know it's not clear that you knowpeople can argue about whether this is
 truly a step toward general ai or not but this is anamazing capability
 uh that you know uh we didn't have a few years agothat you know if a few years ago if you
 had told me that we would have it now that would have surprised meyeah and i think that anyone who denies
 that is just not engaging with what's there

0:52:58
Speaker 0 :so their model it takes a large part of
 the internet and compresses it in a small number ofparameters
 relative to the size of the internet and is able towithout fine-tuning uh
 do a basic kind of a quarrying mechanism just like you described where youspecify a kind of poet and then
 you want to write a poem and somehow i was able to do basically a lookup on theinternet
 well of relevant things i mean that's what i mean i mean i mean

0:53:26
Speaker 1 :how else do you explain it well okay i
 mean i mean the the training involved you know massive amounts ofdata from the internet and actually took
 lots and lots of computer power lots of electricityright you know there are some some very
 prosaic reasons why this wasn't done earlierright right but um you know it costs
 some tens of millions of dollars i think you know that's just for

0:53:47
Speaker 0 :approximately like a few million dollars


0:53:50
Speaker 1 :oh okay okay oh really okay
 you know oh all right all right thank you i mean as they as they scale it upyou know it will


0:53:58
Speaker 0 :cost but then the hope is cost comes
 down and all that kind of stuff

0:54:01
Speaker 1 :but um basically you know it is a
 neural net you know so i mean i mean or what's now called a deep net but youknow they're basically the same thing
 right so it's a it's a form of you know uh algorithmthat people
 have known about for decades right uh butit is constantly trying to solve the
 problem predict the next word right so it's justtrying to
 predict what comes next it's not trying to decidewhat what it should say what ought to be
 true it's trying to predict what someone whohad said all of the words
 up to the preceding one would say next although to push back on that that's how

0:54:41
Speaker 0 :it's trained


0:54:44
Speaker 1 :but that's right no but it's arguable


0:54:45
Speaker 0 :arguable yeah
 that our very cognition could be a mechanism as that simple

0:54:51
Speaker 1 :of course of course i never said that it
 wasn't right but right but yeah i mean i mean and sometimesthat that is
 you know if there is a deep philosophical question that's raised bygpt3 then that is it
 right are we doing anything other than you know this predictive processing justtrying to
 constantly trying to fill in a blank of what would come nextafter what we just said up to this point
 is that what i'm doing right now

0:55:17
Speaker 0 :it's impossible so the intuition that a
 lot of people have will look this thing is not going to be ableto reason the mountain everest
 question do you think it's possible that gbt56 and 7 would be able to with this exact
 same process begin to do something that looks like isindistinguishable to us humans from
 reasoning

0:55:39
Speaker 1 :i mean the truth is that we don't really
 know what the limits are right because exactly because you knowwhat we've seen so far
 is that you know gbt3 was basically the same thing as gpt-2but just with you know a much larger uh
 uh network you know more training time bigger training corpus right and it wasyou know very noticeably better right
 than its immediate predecessor so uh we you know we don't know whereyou hit the ceiling here right i mean
 that's the that's the amazing part and maybe alsothe scary part
 right that uh you know now my guess would be that that you know at somepoint
 like there has to be diminishing returns like it can't be that simplecan it right right but i i i i wish that
 i had more to base that guess on right yeah i mean some people say that

0:56:28
Speaker 0 :there will be a limitation on the
 we're going to hit a limit on the amount of data that's on the internet

0:56:35
Speaker 1 :yes yeah yeah so sure so so there's
 certainly that limit i mean there's also um you know like ifyou are looking for questions that will
 stump gpt3 right you can come up with some without you knowlike you know even getting it to learn
 how to balance parentheses right like it can you know it doesn't dosuch a great job
 right uh you know like like you know and you know andits failures are are are ironic right
 like like basic arithmetic right and you think you know isn't thatwhat computers are supposed to be best
 at yeah isn't that where computers alreadyhad us beat a century ago yeah right
 and yeah and yet that's where gpt-3 struggles right but it'sit's amazing you know that it's almost
 like a young child in that way right that uh uh um butbut uh somehow you know because it is
 just trying to predict what what uh comes next it doesn't knowwhen it should stop
 doing that and start doing something very different like somemore exact logical reasoning right and
 so so you know the uh uh you know you oneone is naturally led to guess
 that our brain sort of has some element of predictive processingbut that it's coupled to other
 mechanisms right that it's coupled to you know first of all visual reasoningwhich gpt3 also doesn't have


0:57:55
Speaker 0 :any of right although there's some
 demonstration that there's a lot of promise there

0:57:59
Speaker 1 :oh yeah it can complete images that's


0:58:01
Speaker 0 :right and using the exact same kind of
 transformer mechanisms to like watch videos on youtubeand uh so the same uh the same
 self-supervised mechanism to be able to look it'd be fascinating to think whatkind of completions you could do oh yeah


0:58:14
Speaker 1 :no absolutely although like
 if we ask it to like you know a word problem that involvereasoning about the locations of things
 in space i don't think it does such a great job on thoseright to take an example and so so the
 guess would be well you know humans have a lot ofpredictive processing a lot of just
 filling in the blanks but we also have these other mechanisms that we cancouple to or that we can sort of call
 the subroutines when we need to and that maybe maybe you know uh to gofurther that one would one would want to
 integrate other forms of reasoning

0:58:46
Speaker 0 :let me go on another topic that is
 amazing uh which is complexity uhwhat uh and then start with the most
 absurdly romantic question of what's the most beautiful idea incomputer science or theoretical computer
 science to you like what just early on in your life or in general i'vecaptivated you and just grabbed you


0:59:08
Speaker 1 :i think i'm gonna have to go with the
 idea of universality uh you know if you're really asking forthe most beautiful
 i mean uh so universality uh is the idea that you know you puttogether a few
 simple operations like in the case of boolean logic that might be the and gatethe or gate the not gate right and then
 your first guess is okay this is a good start butobviously
 as i want to do more complicated things i'm going to need more complicatedbuilding blocks to express that
 right and and that was actually my guess when i first learned what programmingwas
 i mean when i was you know an adolescent and i someone showed meuh uh apple basic and then you know
 uh gw basic if any any anyone listening remembers thatokay but uh you know i thought okay well
 now you know i mean i i thought i felt like um this is arevelation you know it's like
 finding out where babies come from it's like that level of you know why didn'tanyone tell me this before
 right but i thought okay this is just the beginning now i know how to write abasic program
 but to you know really write a an interesting program like a you know avideo game which had always been my my
 dream as a kid to you know create my own nintendo games right thatyou know but
 you know obviously i'm going to need to learn some way more complicated form ofprogramming than that
 okay but you know eventually i learned this incredible idea of universalityand that says that no you throw in a few
 rules and then you can you already have enoughto express
 everything okay so for example the and the or and the notgate uh can all or in fact even just the
 and in the not gate or even just even just the nandgate for example
 uh is already enough to express any boolean functionon any number of bits you just have to
 string together enough of them because

1:01:02
Speaker 0 :you can build a universe with nand gates


1:01:03
Speaker 1 :you can build the universe out of nand
 gates yeah uh you know the the simple instructionsof basic
 are already enough at least in principle you know if we ignore details like howmuch memory can be accessed and stuff
 like that that is enough to express what could beexpressed by any programming language
 whatsoever and the way to prove that is very simplewe simply need to show
 that in basic or whatever we could write aan interpreter or a compiler for
 whatever is other programming language we care aboutlike c or
 or java or whatever and as soon as we had done that then ipso factoanything that's expressible in c or java
 is also expressible and basic okay and so this idea of universalityyou know goes back at least to alan
 turing in the 1930s when you know he uh uh um wrote downthis incredibly
 simple pared down model of a computer the touring machineright which uh you know he pared down
 the instruction set to just read a symbol you know go towrite a symbol move to the left move to
 the right uh halt change your internal state rightthat's it
 okay and anybody proved that um you know this could simulate all kindsof other things
 uh you know and so so in fact today we would saywell we would call it a touring
 universal model of computation that is you know just as it has just thesame expressive power
 that basic or uh java or c plus plus or any of those otherlanguages have
 uh because anything in those other languages could be compiled downto touring machine now touring also
 proved a different related thing which is that there is a single touringmachine
 uh that can simulate any other touring machineif you uh uh just describe that other
 machine on its tape right and likewise there is a singletouring machine
 that will run any c program you know if you just put it on its tapethat's that that's a second meaning of
 universality first of all that he couldn't visualize

1:03:12
Speaker 0 :it and that was in the 30s
 30s that's right before computers really i mean um i don't know how i wonderwhat that felt like uh you know learning
 that there's no santa claus or something uhuh because i i don't know if that's
 empowering or paralyzing because it it doesn't uh give you anyins it's uh
 like you can't write a software engineering book and make thatthe first chapter and say we're done


1:03:41
Speaker 1 :well i mean i mean right i mean i mean
 in one sense it was this enormous flattening of the universeyes right i had imagined that there was
 going to be some infinite hierarchy of more and more powerful programminglanguages
 you know and then i kicked myself for you know for having such a stupid ideabut apparently girdle had had the same
 conjecture in the 30s and then you know you're in good companywell yeah and then and then and then
 tori and then girdle read toring's paper andhe kicked himself and he said yeah i was
 completely wrong about that okay but um but you know i had thoughtthat you know
 maybe maybe where i can contribute will be to invent a new more powerfulprogramming language
 that lets you express things that could never be expressed in basicyeah right and you know and then you
 know how would you do that obviously you couldn't do it itself in basicright but uh uh but you know there is
 this incredible flattening that happens once you learnwhat is universality
 but then it's also um uh like um an opportunity because it means onceyou know these rules
 then you know the sky is the limit right then you have kind of the sameweapons at your disposal that the
 world's greatest programmer has it's now all just a question of how youwield them right


1:04:54
Speaker 0 :exactly but so every problem is
 solvable but some problems are harder than othersand well yeah there's the question of


1:05:01
Speaker 1 :how much time you know
 well of how hard is it to write a program and then there's also thequestions of
 what resources does the program need you know how much time how much memorythose are much more complicated
 questions of course ones that we're still struggling with today

1:05:18
Speaker 0 :exactly so you've uh i don't know if you
 created complexity zoo or

1:05:21
Speaker 1 :i did create the complexity zoo what is


1:05:24
Speaker 0 :it what's complexity


1:05:25
Speaker 1 :oh all right all right complexity theory
 is the study of sort of the inherent resources needed tosolve
 uh computational problems okay so uh uh it's easiest to give an example uh likeuh let's say we want to um um add two
 two numbers right if i want to add them uhum you know if the numbers are twice as
 long then it only it will take me twice as long to addthem but only twice as long
 right it's no worse than that for a computer oror for a person we're using pencil and
 paper for that matter if you have a good algorithmyeah that's right i mean even if you
 just if you just use the elementary schoolalgorithm of just carrying you know then
 it it takes time that is linear in the length of the numbersright now multiplication if you use the
 elementary school algorithm is harder because you have to multiplyeach digit of the first number by each
 digit of the second one yeah and then deal with all the carriesso that's what we call a quadratic time
 algorithm right if um the numbers become twice as long now you need four times asmuch time
 okay so now as it turns out we uh people discovered much faster ways tomultiply numbers using computers
 and today we know how to multiply two numbers that are n digits longusing a number of steps that's nearly
 linear in n these are questions you can ask but nowlet's think about a different thing that
 people uh you know they've encountered inelementary school uh factoring a number
 okay take a number and find its prime factorsright and here you know if i give you a
 number with 10 digits i ask you for its prime factors wellmaybe it's even so you know that two is
 a factor you know maybe it ends in zero so youknow that ten is a factor right but
 you know other than a few obvious things like that you know ifthe prime factors are all very large
 then it's not clear how you even get startedright you know you it seems like you
 have to do an exhaustive search among an enormous number of factors nowum and and as many people might know uh
 the uh for for for better or worse the uhsecurity you know of most of the
 encryption that we currently use to protect the internetis based on the belief and this is not a
 theorem it's a belief that uh that factoring isan inherently hard problem
 uh for our computers we do know algorithms that are better than justtrial division and just trying all the
 possible divisors uh but they are still basically exponential exponential is

1:08:04
Speaker 0 :hard


1:08:05
Speaker 1 :yeah exactly so this so the the fastest
 algorithms that anyone has discovered at least publicly discovered you knowi'm assuming that the nsa doesn't know
 something better yeah okay but they they take time thatbasically grows
 exponentially with the cube root of the size of the number that you're factoringright so that cube root that's the part
 that takes all the cleverness okay but there's still an exponentialthere's still an exponentiality there
 but what that means is that like when people use a thousand bit keys fortheir cryptography
 that can probably be broken using the resources of the nsaor the world's other intelligence
 agencies you know people have done analyses that sayyou know with a few hundred million
 dollars of computer power they could totally do thisand if you look at the documents that
 snowden released you know it it it look it looks a lotlike they are doing that or something
 like that it would kind of be surprising if theyweren't okay but
 you know if that's true then in in some ways that's reassuringbecause if that's the best that they can
 do then that would say that they can't break two thousand bit numbersright exactly exactly right then two


1:09:12
Speaker 0 :

1:09:13
Speaker 1 :thousand bit numbers would be
 would be beyond what even they could do they haven't found an efficient

1:09:17
Speaker 0 :algorithm that's where
 all the worries and the concerns of quantum computing came in that there'ssome kind of shortcut around that right


1:09:24
Speaker 1 :so complexity theory
 is a you know is is a huge part of let's say the theoretical core of computerscience
 you know it it started in the 60s and 70sas you know sort of a you know
 autonomous field so it was you know already you know i mean youknow it was
 well developed even by the time that i was bornokay but uh um uh i in 2002 i made a
 website called the complexities zoo uh to answer your question uh where ijust tried to catalog
 the different complexity classes which are classes of problems that aresolvable with different kinds of
 resources right okay so these are kind of um youknow you could think of complexity
 classes as like being almost to to totheoretical computer science like what
 the elements are to chemistry right they're sort of you know there areour most basic
 objects in in a certain way i feel like

1:10:22
Speaker 0 :the elements
 have uh have a characteristic to them where you can't just addan infinite number well you could but


1:10:29
Speaker 1 :beyond a certain point they become
 unstable right right so it's like you know intheory you can have atoms with
 yeah and look look i mean i mean i mean a neutron star you know is a nucleuswith you know
 uncalled billions of of of of nuke of of uh of of of of neutrons in it of ofhadrons in it okay but
 uh um you know for for sort of normal atoms right probably you can't getmuch above 100 you know atomic weight
 150 or so or sorry sorry i mean i mean beyond 150or so protons without it
 you know very quickly fissioning uh with complexity classes well yeah youyou can have an infinity of complexity
 classes uh but you know maybe there's only a finite number of themthat are particularly interesting
 right just like with anything else you know you uhuh you care about some more than about
 others so what kind of interesting

1:11:24
Speaker 0 :classes are there
 yeah i mean you could have just maybe say what are theif you you take any kind of computer
 science class what are the classes you learngood let me let me tell you sort of the


1:11:33
Speaker 1 :the the biggest ones the ones that you
 would learn first so you know first of all there isp
 that's what it's called okay it stands for polynomial timeand this is just the class of all of the
 problems that you could solve with a conventionalcomputer
 like your iphone or your laptop uh you know by a completely deterministicalgorithm right using a number of steps
 that grows only like the size of the inputraised to some fixed power okay so
 uh if your algorithm is linear time like you know for adding numbersokay that that problem is in p if you
 have an algorithm that's quadratic time like the uh elementary school algorithmfor multiplying two numbers that's also
 in p even if it was the size of the input tothe 10th power
 or to the 50th power well that wouldn't be very uhgood in practice but you know formally
 we would still count that that would still be in pokay but if your algorithm takes
 exponential time meaning like if every time i add onemore
 uh data point to your input if the time that needed by the algorithmdoubles if you need time like
 2 to the power of the amount of input datathen uh that is that we call an
 exponential time algorithm okay and that is not polynomial okay sop
 is all of the problems that have some polynomial time algorithmokay so that includes most of what we do
 with our computers on a day-to-day basis you knowall the you know sorting basic
 arithmetic you know whatever is going on in youremail reader or in angry birds
 okay it's all in p then the next uh super important classis called np uh that stands for
 non-deterministic polynomial okay does not stand for not polynomialwhich is a
 common confusion um but np was basically all of the problemswhere if there is a solution then it is
 easy to check the solution if someone shows it to you okay soactually a perfect
 example of a problem in np is uh factoring the one i told you aboutbefore like if i
 gave you a number with thousands of digits and i told youthat you know i i asked you does this
 uh does this have at least um three non-trivial divisorsright that might be a super hard problem
 to solve right might take you millions of yearsusing any algorithm that's known at
 least running on our existing computers okay but if i simply showed you thedivisors
 i said here are three divisors of this numberthen it would be very easy for you to
 ask your computer to just check each one and see if itworks just divide it in
 see if there's any remainder right and if they all go inthen you've checked well i guess there
 were right so um so any problemwhere you know wherever there's a
 solution there is a short witness that can be easily like a polynomialsize
 witness that can be checked in polynomial timethat we call an np problem okay
 beautiful and uh yeah so so every problem that'sin p
 is also in np right because you know you could always justignore the witness and just you know if
 a problem is in p you can just solve it yourselfright okay but now the influence is the
 central you know mystery of theoretical computerscience
 is is every np problem in p so if you can easily check the answer to aa computational problem does that mean
 that you can also easily find the answer even though there's all these problems

1:15:19
Speaker 0 :that appear to
 be very difficult to find the answer it's still an open question whethera good answer exists so what's yours no


1:15:28
Speaker 1 :one has proven that there's no way to do
 it it's

1:15:30
Speaker 0 :arguably the most uh
 i don't know the most famous the most maybe interesting maybe disagree withthat
 problem in theoretical computer science so what's your most famous for sure

1:15:41
Speaker 1 :p equals np yeah if you were to bet all


1:15:42
Speaker 0 :your money
 where do you put your money that's an

1:15:45
Speaker 1 :easy one p is not equal to np okay so i
 like to say that if we were physicists we would have just declared that to be alaw of nature
 you know just like just like thermodynamics it's hilariousgiving ourselves nobel prizes for its
 discovery yeah you know and look if later if later it turned out that wewere wrong we just give ourselves
 more more nobel prizes yeah i mean no i mean i mean i mean it's it'sreally just because we are
 mathematicians or descended from mathematicians you knowwe have to call things conjectures that
 other people would just call empirical facts or discoveriesright but one shouldn't read more into
 the difference in in language you know about the underlying truth so

1:16:29
Speaker 0 :okay so you're a good investor and good
 spender money so then let me i don't know that let me ask another wayis it possible at
 all and what would that look like if p indeed equals np well i do think that

1:16:42
Speaker 1 :it's possible i mean in fact you know
 when people really pressed me on my blog for what odds would i putlike well you know two or three percent
 odds wow that's pretty good that p equals np yeah just speak well umbecause you know when p
 i mean i mean you you really have to think about like if there were50 you know mysteries like p versus np
 and if i made a guess about every single one of themwould i expect to be right 50 times
 right and the truthful answer is no okay yeah so you know and and and andand that's what you really mean in
 saying that you know you have you know better than 98 odds forsomething
 okay but um so so yeah you know i mean there could certainly be surprises andlook if p
 equals np well then there would be the further questionof you know is the algorithm actually
 efficient in practice right i mean don knuth who i know thatyou you've interviewed as well
 right he uh likes to conjecture that p equals np but that the algorithm is soinefficient that it doesn't matter
 anyway right now i i don't know i've listened to him say that i don't knowwhether he says that just because he has
 an actual reason for thinking it's true or just because it sounds coolyeah okay but um but you know that
 that's a logical possibility right that the algorithm could ben to the 10 000 time or it could even
 just be n squared time but with a leading constantof a it could be a google times n
 squared or something like that and in that case the fact that p equals npwell it would it would uh you know
 ravage the whole theory of uh complexity we would have to youknow rebuild from the ground up
 but in practical terms it might mean very little rightif the algorithm was too inefficient to
 run if the algorithm could actually be run in practice likeif if it had small enough constants
 you know to or if you could improve it to where it hadsmall enough constants that it was uh
 efficient in practice then that would change the world okayyou think it would have like what kind


1:18:43
Speaker 0 :of impact
 well okay i mean i mean here's an

1:18:45
Speaker 1 :example i mean you could well okay
 just for starters you could break basically all of the encryption thatpeople use to protect the internet first
 you could you could break bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency or you knowuh mine as much bitcoin as you wanted
 right uh you know become a you know become a asuper duper billionaire right and then
 and then plot your next move right okay that's just for startersright right now your next move might be
 something like you know you now have like atheoretically optimal way
 to train any neural network to find parameters for any neural network rightso you could now say like is there any
 small neural network that generates the entire content of wikipediaright if you know and now the question
 is not can you find it the question has been reduced to doesthat exist or not yes
 if it does exist then the answer would be yes you can find itokay if if if you had this algorithm in
 your hands okay you could ask your computer youknow i mean i mean
 p versus np is one of these seven problems that carries this milliondollar prize from the clay foundation
 you know if you solve it uh you know and others are the riemann hypothesisuh the punk array conjecture which was
 solved although the solver turned down the priceright and uh and and four others but
 what i like to say the way that we can see that p versus npis the biggest of all of these questions
 is that if you had this fast algorithm then you could solve all seven of themokay you just ask your computer you know
 is there a short proof of the riemann hypothesisright you know that a machine could in a
 language where a machine could verify it and provided that such a proof existsthen your computer finds it
 in a short amount of time without having to do a brute force searchokay so i mean i mean those are the
 stakes of what we're talking about but i hope that also helps to give yourlisteners some intuition
 of why i and most of my colleagues would put our money on p not equaling np

1:20:46
Speaker 0 :is it possible i apologize this is a
 really dumb question but is it possible tothat proof will come out that p equals
 np but an algorithm that makes pequals np is impossible to find
 um is that like crazy okay well well if

1:21:03
Speaker 1 :p equals np
 it would mean that there is such an algorithm that it exists yeahbut um um you know it would it would
 mean that it exists now you know in practice normally theway that we
 would prove anything like that would be by finding the algorithm by finding thatone algorithm
 but there is such a thing as a non-constructive proofthat an algorithm exists you know this
 is really only reared its head i think a few timesin the history of our field right but
 you know it is it is theoretically possible that thatthat
 that such a thing could happen but you know there are so even here there aresome amusing observations that one could
 make so there is this famous observation ofleonid levin
 who is you know one of the original discoverers of np completeness right andhe said
 well consider the following algorithm that like i i guaranteewe'll solve the np problems efficiently
 just as provided that p equals np okay here is what it does itjust
 runs you know it enumerates every possible algorithmin a gigantic infinite list yeah right
 from like in like alphabetical order rightyou know and many of them maybe won't
 even compile so we just ignore those okay but nowwe just you know run the first algorithm
 then we run the second algorithm we run the first one a little bitmore then we run the first three
 algorithms for a while we won the first four for a whilethis is called dovetailing by the way
 this is a known trick in um uh um theoretical computer scienceokay but
 we do it in such a way that you know whatever is the algorithmout there in in in our list that solves
 np-complete you know the np problems efficiently will eventually hit that oneright and now the key is that whenever
 we hit that one you know it you know by assumption ithas to solve the problem that's to find
 the solution and once it claims to find a solutionthen we can check that ourself
 right because these are increasing problems then we can check itnow this is utterly impractical all
 right you know you'd have to do this enormous exhaustive search among all thealgorithms
 but from a certain theoretical standpoint that is merely a constantprefactor
 that's merely a multiplier of your running time so there are tricks likethat one can do to say that
 in some sense the algorithm would have to be uh constructivebut you know in in in the human sense
 you know it is possible that you know it's conceivable that one couldprove such a thing uh via a
 non-constructive method is is that likely i don't think so first no nono not personally so that's p and and p


1:23:43
Speaker 0 :but the complexities it was full of
 wonderful creatures well it's got about 500 of them 500.so how do you get uh yeah
 yeah how do you get more how do you yeah

1:23:54
Speaker 1 :well yeah well okay i mean i mean
 i mean just for starters there is everything that we could dowith a conventional computer with a
 polynomial amount of memory okay but possibly an exponential amountof time because we get to reuse the same
 memory over and over again okay that is called p space okay andthat's actually a
 uh we think an even larger class than np okay well p is contained in np which iscontained in p space
 and we think that those containments are strict and

1:24:27
Speaker 0 :the constraint there is on the memory
 the memory has to grow polynomially with the size of theproduct that's right that's right but in


1:24:34
Speaker 1 :p space
 we now have interesting things that were not in in nplike uh as a famous example you know
 from a given position in chess you know does white or blackhave the win
 let's say assuming provided that the game lasts only for aa reasonable number of moves okay or or
 or likewise for go okay and you know even for the generalizations ofthese games to arbitrary
 size boards because with an eight by eight board you could say that's just aconstant size problem you just
 you know in principle you just solve it in o of one time right butso we really mean the uh the
 generalizations of you know games to uh arbitrary sizeboards here
 or um another thing in p space would be uhlike i give you some really hard um
 constraint satisfaction problem like you know a you know travelingperson
 or you know packing boxes into the trunk of your car or something like thatand i asked not just is there a solution
 which would be an np problem but i ask how many solutions are thereokay
 that you know count the number of of solu of valid solutionsthat that that actually gives those
 problems lie in a complexity class calledsharp p or like it looks like hashtag
 like hashtag p you got it okay which sits betweennp and p space um there's all the
 problems that you can do in exponential timeokay that's called x so um
 and by the way uh it it was proven in the 60sthat x is larger than p okay so we know
 that much we know that there are problems that aresolvable in exponential time
 that are not solvable in polynomial time okayin fact we even know more we know that
 there are problems that are solvable in n cube time that are not solvable in nsquared time
 and that those don't help us with a

1:26:28
Speaker 0 :controversy between p and m


1:26:31
Speaker 1 :unfortunately it seems not or certainly
 not yet right the the the techniques that we useto establish those things
 they're very very related to how touring proved the unsolvability of the haltingproblem
 but they seem to break down when we're comparing two differentresources like time versus space
 or like you know p versus np okay but you know i mean there's there's what youcan do with a randomized algorithm
 right that can sometimes you know with some has some probability of making amistake
 that's called bpp bounded our probabilistic polynomial timeand then of course there's one that's
 very close to my own heart what you can efficiently do duringpolynomial time
 using a quantum computer okay and that's called bqpright and so you know what's understood
 about that class

1:27:19
Speaker 0 :okay so p is contained in bpp


1:27:22
Speaker 1 :which is contained in bqp which is
 contained in p space okay so anything you can in factin in like
 in something very similar to sharp p bqp is basicallyyou know well it's contained in like p
 with the magic power to solve sharp p problems okay why why is bqp

1:27:42
Speaker 0 :contained in uh p space oh that's an


1:27:45
Speaker 1 :excellent question
 uh so uh there there is um well i mean one one has to prove thatokay but uh
 the proof um uh you could you could think of itas uh using uh richard feynman's picture
 of quantum mechanics which is that you can always you know wehaven't really talked about uh
 quantum mechanics in this in this conversation we we did in our previousyeah
 yeah we did last time but yeah we did last time okay but uhuh but basically you could always think
 of a quantum computation as uh like a branching tree ofpossibilities
 where each pos each possible path that you could takethrough you know your the space has a
 complex number attached to it called an amplitude okay and nowthe rule is you know when you make a
 measurement at the end well you see a random answer okay butquantum mechanics is all about
 calculating the probability that you're going to see one potential answer versusanother one
 right and the rule for calculating the probability that you'll see some answeris that you have to add up the
 amplitudes for all of the paths that could have led to that answerand then you know that's a complex
 number so that you know how could that be a probability then youtake the squared absolute value of the
 result that gives you a number between zero andone okay
 so um yeah i just i just summarized quantum mechanics in like 30 secondsokay but uh but now you know what what
 this already tells us is that anything i cando with a quantum computer
 i could simulate with a classical computer if ionly have exponentially more time okay
 and why is that because if i have exponentialtime
 i could just write down this entire branching treeand just explicitly calculate each of
 these amplitudes right you know that will be veryinefficient but it will work
 right it's enough to show that quantum computers could notsolve the halting problem or you know
 they could never do anything that is literallyuncomputable in touring sense okay but
 now as i said there is even a strongerresult which says that bqp
 is contained in p space the way that we prove thatis that we say if if all i want is to
 calculate the probability of some particularoutput happening
 we know which is all i need to simulate a quantum computer reallythen i don't need to write down the
 entire quantum state which is an exponentially large objectall i need to do
 is just calculate what is the amplitude for that final stateand to do that i just have to sum up
 all the amplitudes that lead to that state okay so that's an exponentiallylarge sum
 but i can calculate it just reusing the same memory over and overfor each term in the song hence the p in


1:30:37
Speaker 0 :the pieces
 yeah yeah so what uh out of that whole complexity zoo and itcould be bqp what do you find is the
 most uh

1:30:48
Speaker 1 :uh the class that captured your heart


1:30:49
Speaker 0 :the most
 is the most beautiful class there's just yeah

1:30:54
Speaker 1 :i i used uh as my email address uh
 bqpqpali gmail.com yes because uh bqp slash q polywell you know amazingly no one had taken
 it amazing but you know but th this is a class thati was involved in sort of uh
 defining proving the first theorems about uh in 2003 or soso it was kind of close to my heart but
 this is like if we extended um bqp which is the class of everythingwe can do efficiently with a quantum
 computer uh to allow quantum advice which meansimagine that you had some special
 initial state okay that could somehow help you docomputation and maybe
 um such a state would be exponentially hard to prepareokay but you know maybe somehow these
 states were formed in the big bang or something and they've just been sittingaround ever since right if you found one
 and if this state could be like ultra powerthere are no limits on how powerful it
 could be except that this state doesn't know inadvance which
 input you've got right it only knows the size of your inputyou know and then that that's bqp slash
 q probably so that's that's one that i justpersonally happen to love
 okay but um you know if you're asking like what's theyou know there's there's there's a class
 that i think is is is way more beautiful than you know orfundamental
 that a lot of people even within uh this this field realize that it isthat class is called sck or statistical
 zero knowledge um and you know there's a very very easyway to define this class which is to say
 suppose that i have two algorithms that each sample from probabilitydistributions
 right so each one just outputs random samplesaccording to you know possibly different
 distributions and now the question i ask is you knowyou know let's say distributions over
 strings of n bits yeah so over an exponentially largespace now i ask
 are these two distributions close or far as probability distributions okay anyproblem that can be reduced to that
 you know that can be put into that form is an sdkproblem and the way that this class was
 originally discovered was completely different from thatand was kind of more complicated it was
 discovered as the class of all of the problemsthat have a certain kind of what's
 called zero knowledge proof zero knowledge proofs are one of thecentral ideas in cryptography
 um you know shafi goldwasser and silvio mccauley won the touring awardfor you know inventing them and they're
 at the core of even some some cryptocurrencies that you knowpeople people use nowadays but
 um there are zero knowledge proofs or ways of proving to someone thatsomething is true
 like you know that there is a a solution to thisyou know uh optimization problem or that
 these two graphs are isomorphic to each other or somethingbut without revealing why it's true
 without revealing anything about why it's trueokay sdk is all of the problems
 for which there is such a proof uh that doesn't rely on any cryptographyokay and if if you wonder like how could
 such a thing possibly exist right well like imagine that i had twographs and i wanted to convince you that
 these two graphs are not isomorphic meaning you know i cannotpermute one of them so that it's the
 same as the other one right you know that might be a very hardstatement to prove like i might
 you know you might have to do a very exhaustive enumeration of you know allthe different
 permutations before you were convinced that it was true but what if there weresome
 all-knowing wizard that said to you look i'll tell you whatjust pick one of the graphs randomly
 then randomly permute it then send it to me and i will tell youwhich graph you started with
 okay and i will do that every single timeright and load that in


1:34:59
Speaker 0 :

1:35:01
Speaker 1 :and let's say that that wizard did that
 a hundred times and it was right every time yeah rightnow if the graphs were isomorphic then
 you know it would have been flipping a coin each timeright it would have had only a one in
 two to the 100 power chance of you know of guessingright each time
 but you know so so if it's right every time then now you're statisticallyconvinced that these graphs are not
 isomorphic even though you've learned nothing newabout why they aren't so fascinating so
 yeah so so sdk is all of the problems that haveprotocols like that one
 but it has this beautiful other characterization it's shown up again andagain
 in my in my own work in you know a lot of people's workand i think that it really is one of the
 most fundamental classes it's just that people didn't realizethat when it was first discovered


1:35:48
Speaker 0 :so we're living in the middle of a
 pandemic currently yeah how has your life been changed or no better toask like how is your perspective of the
 world change with this uh world-changing event of apandemic overtaking the entire world


1:36:04
Speaker 1 :yeah well i mean i mean all of our lives
 have changed you know like i guess as with no other event since iwas born you know you would have to go
 back to world war ii for something i think of thismagnitude you know uh
 on you know the way that we live our lives as for how it has changed my worldview i think that the the failure of
 institutions you know like uh like like the cdclike you know other institutions that we
 sort of thought were were trustworthy like a lot of the media uhwas
 uh staggering was was absolutely breathtakinguh it is something that i would not have
 predicted right i think i i uh wrote on my blog uh uh that youknow
 you know it it's it's abs it's fascinating to like re-watch the movieuh contagion
 from a decade ago right that correctly foresawso many aspects of you know what was
 going on you know a uh an airborne you know virusoriginates in china
 spreads to you know much of the world you know shuts everything downuntil a vaccine can be developed uh you
 know everyone has to stay at home you knowyou know it gets uh um you know an
 enormous number of things right okay but the one thing that they couldnot imagine you know is that like
 in this movie everyone from the government is likehyper comp competent hyper you know
 dedicated to the public good right best of the best you know yeah thethey're the best of the best
 you know they could you know and there are these conspiracy theoristsright who uh think you know you know
 this is all fake news there's no there's not really a pandemicand those are some random people on the
 internet who the hyper competent government people have to you knowoppose right
 they you know in in trying to envision the worst thing that could happenlike you know the the there was a
 failure of imagination the movie makers did not imaginethat the conspiracy theorists and the
 you know and the incompetence and the nut caseswould have captured
 our institutions and be the ones actually running thingsso you had a certain yeah i i love


1:38:09
Speaker 0 :competence
 in all walks of life i love i get so much energy i'm so excited but people doamazing job and i like you
 uh well maybe you can clarify but i had maybe not an intuition but i hope thatgovernment at his best could be ultra
 com competent what uh first of alltwo questions like how do you explain
 the lack of confidence and the other maybe on the positive sidehow can we build a more competent
 government

1:38:38
Speaker 1 :well there's an election in two months i
 mean you know you have a faith that the election i uhyou know it's not gonna fix
 everything but you know it's like i feel like there is a ship that is sinking andyou could at least stop the sinking
 but uh uh you know i think that there are there are much much deeper problemsi mean i think that
 uh um you know it is it is plausible to methat you know a lot of the the failures
 you know with the cdc with uh some of the other healthagencies even you know
 you know pre-date trump you know pre-date the you know right-wingpopulism that has sort of
 taken over much of the world now and um you know i think that uh uhyou know it was is you know it is very
 i'm actually you know i've actually been strongly infavor of
 you know rushing vaccines of uh uh you know i thought that we could havedone you know human
 human challenge trials you know which were not doneright we could have you know like i had
 you know volunteers you know to uh uh actually you know beyou know uh get vaccines get you know
 exposed to covid so you know

1:39:47
Speaker 0 :innovative ways of accelerating what
 you've done previously over a long

1:39:50
Speaker 1 :time i thought that you know each each
 month that you that that a vaccine is is closer is like trillions of dollarsare used for civilization
 and of course lives you know at least you know hundreds of thousands of livesare you surprised that it's taking this


1:40:03
Speaker 0 :long we still don't have a plan there's
 still not a feeling like anyone is actuallydoing anything in terms of uh
 elite alleviating like any kind of plan so there's a bunch of stuff this vaccinebut you could also do
 a testing infrastructure where yeah everybody's tested non-stop with contacttracing all that kind of well i mean i


1:40:22
Speaker 1 :i'm as surprised as almost everyone else
 i mean this is a historic failure it is one of thebiggest failures in the 240 year history
 of the united states right and we should be you know crystalclear about that
 and you know one thing that i think has been missing you know eveneven from the more competent side is
 like you know is sort of the the world war ii mentality right theyou know the mentality of you know let's
 just you know you know if if if we can bybreaking a whole bunch of rules
 you know get a vaccine and you know and evenhalf the amount of time as we thought
 then let's just do that because uh you know you know like likewe have to we have to weigh
 all of the moral qualms that we have about doing thatagainst the moral qualms of not doing
 and one key

1:41:15
Speaker 0 :little aspect yeah that's deeply
 important to me and going that topic next is uh the world war ii mentalitywasn't just about
 you know breaking all the rules to get the job done there was a togetherness toit
 there's yes so i would if i were president right now it seems quiteelementary
 to unite the country because we're facing a crisisit's easy to make the virus the enemy
 and it's very surprising to me that um the div the division hasincreased as opposed to decreasing yeah
 so that that's that's heartbreaking yeahwell look i mean it's been said by


1:41:50
Speaker 1 :others that this is the first time
 in the country's history that we have a president who does not even pretendto you know what want to unite the
 country right yeah and you know i mean i mean i meanlincoln who fought a civil war
 you know you know said he wanted to unite the countryright uh you know and and and i i do
 i do worry enormously about what happens if the results of this election arecontested you know
 and you know will there be violence as a result of thatand will we have a clear path of
 succession and you know look i mean you know thisis all we're going to find out the
 answers to this in two months and if none of that happensmaybe i'll look foolish but i am willing
 to go on the record and say i am terrified about that yeah i've been

1:42:36
Speaker 0 :reading the the rise and fall of the
 third reich this is it so if i can this this is like onelittle voice
 to put out there that i think november will be a really critical monthfor people to breathe and put
 love out there do not you know anger in those in that context no matterwho wins no matter what is said
 will destroy our country may destroy our country it may destroy the world becauseof the power of the country
 so it's really important to be patient loving empatheticlike one of the things that troubles me
 is that even people on the left are unable to have a love and respectfor people who voted for trump they
 can't imagine that there's good people that could votefor the opposite side and that's


1:43:23
Speaker 1 :oh i know there are because i know some
 of them yeah right i mean you know it's stillyou know maybe it baffles me but you
 know i i know such people let me ask you this it's also

1:43:33
Speaker 0 :heartbreaking to me
 on the topic of cancer culture yeah so in the machine learning community i'veseen it a little bit
 that there's um aggressive attacking of people who are trying tohave a nuanced conversation about things
 and it's troubling because it feels like nuanced conversation is the only way totalk about difficult topics
 and when there's a thought police and speech policeon any nuanced conversation that
 everybody has to like in animal farm chant that racism is bad andsexism is bad which is
 things that everybody believes and they're they can't possibly say anythingnuance
 it feels like it goes against any kind of progressfrom my kind of shallow perspective but
 you've written a little bit about cancer culture did you have thoughtsthat are well
 i mean i mean i mean to say that i am

1:44:26
Speaker 1 :opposed to
 you know the this trend of of cancellations or of you know shoutingpeople down rather
 than engaging them that would be a massive understatementright and i feel like you know i have
 put my money where my mouth is you know not as much as some people havebut you know i i've tried to do
 something i mean i have defended you know uh some unpopularpeople
 and unpopular you know ideas on my blog i've you know tried to defend you knownorms of uh
 of uh of of open discourse of you know reasoning with our opponents even wheni've been shouted down for that
 on social media uh you know called a racist called a sexistall of those things and which by the way
 i should say you know i would be perfectly happy to you know say you knowif we had time to say you know
 you know ten thousand times you know my uh hatred ofracism of sexism of homophobia
 right but what i don't want to do is to cede to uh some particular politicalfaction the right to define
 exactly what is meant by those terms to say well thenyou have to agree with all of these
 other extremely contentious positions or else you are a misogynistor else you are a racist
 right i say that well no you know you know don'tlike don't i or you know
 don't people like me also get a say in the discussionabout you know what is racism about what
 is going to be the most effective to combat racismright and you know this this this um
 cancellation mentality i think is spectacularly ineffectiveat its own professed goal of you know
 combating racism and sexism

1:46:14
Speaker 0 :what's a positive way out so i i try to
 i don't know if you see what i do on twitter but i on twitter i mostly and inmy whole in my life
 i've actually it's who i am to the core is like i really focus on the positiveand i try to put love out there in the
 world yeah and still i get attacked and i look at that and iwonder like are you two
 i didn't know like i haven't actually said anything difficultand nuanced you talk about somebody like
 steven pinker yeah who i actually don't know the fullrange of
 things that um that he's attacked for buthe tries to say difficult he tries to be
 thoughtful about difficult topics he does and obviouslyhe just gets
 slaughtered by well i mean i mean i mean

1:47:01
Speaker 1 :i mean yes but it's also amazing how
 well steve has withstood it i mean he just survived that attempt to cancel himjust a couple of months ago right
 psychologically he survives it too which

1:47:12
Speaker 0 :yeah worries me he says i don't think i
 can yeah i i've gotten to know steve a

1:47:16
Speaker 1 :bit
 he is incredibly unperturbed by this stuff uh i i admire that and i envy iti wish that i could be like that i mean
 my impulse when i'm getting attacked is i just want to engageevery single like anonymous person on
 twitter and reddit who is saying mean stuffabout me and i wanted to say well look
 can we just talk this over for an hour and then you knowyou'll see that i'm not that bad and you
 know sometimes that even works the problem is then there's the you know the20 000 other ones
 right that's not but psychologically

1:47:49
Speaker 0 :does that wear on you


1:47:52
Speaker 1 :it does it does but yeah i mean in terms
 of what is the solution i mean i wish i knewright and so you know in a certain way
 these problems are maybe harder than p versus np right imean
 uh you know but but i think that part of it has to be for you know thati think that there's a lot of sort of
 silent support for what i'll call the the the opendiscourse side the you know reasonable
 enlightenment side and i think that that that support hasto become less silent
 right i think that a lot of people uh this sort of you knowlike agree that oh you know a lot of
 these cancellations and attacks are ridiculousbut are just afraid to say so right or
 else they'll get they'll get shouted down as wellright that's just the standard witch
 hunt dynamic which you know of course thisuh you know this faction understands and
 exploits to its great advantage but um you know if more people justyou know said you know like we're not
 going to stand for this right uh uh you know you know this isthis is you know
 where guess what we're against racism too but you knowthis you know what you're doing is
 ridiculous right um you know and the hard part is like ittakes a lot of mental energy it takes a
 lot of time you know even if you feel like you'renot going to be cancelled or you know
 you're staying on the safe side like it takes a lot of time to uh to tophrase
 things in exactly the right way and to uh you know respond to everything peoplesay so
 but i think that um you know the more people speak up than uhuh you know from from from all political
 persuasions you know from like all you know walks of life then you knowthe the easier it is to move forward


1:49:34
Speaker 0 :since we've been talking about love can
 you um last time i talked to you about meaningof life a little bit but
 here has it's a weird question to ask a computer scientist buthas love for other human beings for
 for things for the world around you played an important role in your lifehave you um
 you know it's easy for a world-class computer scientist uhuh yeah you could even call yourself
 like a physicist everything to be lost in the books isthe connection to other humans
 love for other humans played an important role i love my kids

1:50:12
Speaker 1 :uh i love my wife i love my parents
 um uh you know i um i'm probably not not different frommost people and loving their families
 uh and and in that being very important uhin my life uh now i should remind you
 that you know i am a theoretical computer scientistif you're looking for deep insight about
 the nature of love you're probably looking in the wrong placeto ask me but uh but sure it's been
 important but is it uh is there something from a

1:50:47
Speaker 0 :computer science perspective to be said
 about love is there uh or is that is that even beyond into therealm of beyond
 the realm of consciousness there was

1:50:57
Speaker 1 :there was this great uh
 cartoon i think it was one of the classic xkcds where it shows like aheart
 and it's like you know squaring the heart taking the four-year transform ofthe heart
 you know integrating the heart you know uh uhyou know each each thing and then it
 says you know my normal approach is useless herei'm so glad i asked this question i
 think there's no better way to uh

1:51:21
Speaker 0 :to end this guy i hope we get a chance
 to talk again this has been an amazing cool experiment to do it outside yeahreally glad you made it out yeah well i
