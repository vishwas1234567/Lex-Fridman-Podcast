Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 Stephen Wolfram a computer scientist mathematician and theoretical physicistwho is the founder and CEO of Wolfram
 research a company behind Mathematica Wolfram Alpha Wolfram language and thenew Wolfram physics project is the
 author of several books including a new kind of science which on a personal notewas one of the most influential books in
 my journey in computer science and artificial intelligence it made me fallin love with the mathematical beauty and
 power of cellular automata it is true that perhaps one of the criticisms ofStephen is in a human level that he has
 a big ego which prevents some researchers from fully enjoying thecontent of his ideas we talked about
 this point in this conversation to me ego can lead you astray but can also bea superpower one that fuels bold
 innovative thinking that refuses to surrender to the cautious ways ofacademic institutions and here
 especially I ask you to join me in looking past the peculiarities of humannature and opening your mind to the
 beauty of ideas and Stephens work and in this conversationI believe Stephen Wolfram is one of the
 most original minds of our time and at the core is a kind curious and brillianthuman being this conversation was
 recorded in November 2000 nineteen when the Wolfram physics project was underwaybut not yet ready for public exploration
 as it is now we now agreed to talk again probably multiple times in the nearfuture so this is round one and stay

 create the alien language in the movie arrival so let me ask maybe a bit of acrazy question but if aliens were to
 visit us on earth do you think we would be able to find a common language well

0:04:31
Speaker 1 :by the time we're saying
 aliens are visiting us we've already prejudiced the whole story because theyou know the concept of alien actually
 visiting so to speak we already know they're kind of things that make senseto talk about visiting so we already
 know they exist in the same kind of physical setup that we do they're notyou know it's not just radio signals
 it's an actual thing that shows up and so on so I think in terms of you knowcan one find ways to communicate well
 the best example we have of this right now is AI I mean that's our first sortof example of alien intelligence and the
 question is how well do we communicate with AI you know if you were to say ifyou were in the middle of a neural net
 and you open it up and it's like what are you thinking can you discuss thingswith it it's not easy but it's not
 absolutely impossible so I think I think by the time but given the setup of yourquestion aliens visiting I think the
 answer is yes one will be able to find some form of communication whatevercommunication means communication
 requires notions of purpose and things like this it's a kind of philosophical

0:05:46
Speaker 0 :quagmire so if AI is a kind of alien
 life-form what do you think visiting looks like so if we look at aLian's visiting yeah and we'll get to
 discuss computation and and the world of computation but if you were to imagineyou said you're already prejudiced
 something by saying you visit but what how would a lian's visit by visit

0:06:08
Speaker 1 :there's kind of an implication and here
 we're using the imprecision of human language you know in a world of thefuture and if that's represented in
 computational language we might be able to take the the concept visit and golook in the documentation basically and
 find out exactly what does that mean what properties does it have and so onbut by visit
 in ordinary human language I'm kind of taking it to be there's you knowsomething a physical embodiment that
 shows up in a spacecraft since we kind of know that that's necessarywe're not imagining it's just you know
 photons showing up in a radio signal that you know photons in some veryelaborate pattern we're imagining it's
 it's physical things made of atoms and so on that that show up can't be photons

0:06:58
Speaker 0 :

0:07:00
Speaker 1 :in a pattern well that's good question I
 mean whether there is the possibility you know what counts as intelligencegood question I mean it's some you know
 and I used to think there was sort of a oh they'll be you know it'll be clearwhat it means to find extraterrestrial
 intelligence etcetera etcetera etcetera I've I've increasingly realized as aresult of science that I've done that
 there really isn't a bright line between the intelligent and the merelycomputational so to speak so you know in
 our kind of everyday sort of discussion will say things like you know theweather has a mind of its own
 well we'd let's unpack that question you know we realize that there arecomputational processes that go on that
 determine the fluid dynamics of this and that and the atmosphere or etceteraetcetera etcetera how do we sting which
 distinguish that from the processes that go on in our brains of you know thephysical processes that go on in our
 brains how do we how do we had we separate those how do we say the thephysical processes going on that
 represents sophisticated computations in the weather oh that's not the same asthe physical processes that go on that
 represent sophisticated computations in our brains cancer is I don't think thereis a fundamental distinction I think the
 distinction for us is that there's kind of a a thread of history and so on thatconnects kind of what happens in
 different brains to each other so to speak and it's a you know what happensin the weather is something which is not
 connected by sort of a a thread of civilizational history so to speak to

0:08:32
Speaker 0 :what we're used to in our story in the
 stories that the human brains told us but maybe the weather has its own

0:08:38
Speaker 1 :stories that's Allah's house absolutely
 and that's and that's where we run into trouble thinking about extraterrestrialintelligence because
 you know it's like that pulsar magnetosphere that's generating thesevery elaborate radio signals you know is
 that something that we should think of as being this whole civilization that'sdeveloped over the last however long you
 know millions of years of of processes going on in the in the neutron star orwhatever um versus what you know what
 we're used to in human intelligence and I think it's a I think in the end youknow when people talk about
 extraterrestrial intelligence and where is it in the whole you know Fermiparadox of how come there's no other
 signs of intelligence in the universe my guess is that we've got sort of twoalien forms of intelligence that we're
 dealing with artificial intelligence and sort of physical or extraterrestrialintelligence and my guess is people will
 sort of get comfortable with the fact that both of these have been achievedaround the same time and in other words
 people will say well yes we're used to computers things we've created digitalthings we've created being sort of
 intelligent like we are and they'll sell we're kind of also used to the idea thatthere are things around the universe
 that are kind of intelligent like we are except they don't share the sort ofcivilizational history that we have and
 so we don't they know they're they're a different branchI mean it's similar to when you talk
 about life for instance I mean you you you kind of said life form I thinkalmost synonymously with intelligence
 which I don't think is is some you know I the the a eyes will be upset to hearyou I wait those guys I really probably


0:10:19
Speaker 0 :implied biological life right right
 right but you're saying I mean we'll explore this more but you're saying it'sreally a spectrum and it's all just the
 kind of computation and so it's it's a full spectrum and we just make ourselvesspecial by weaving a narrative around
 our particular kinds of computation yes

0:10:39
Speaker 1 :I mean what the thing that I think I've
 kind of come to realize is you know it's a little depressing to realize thatthere's there's so little it's
 liberating well yeah but I mean it's you know it's the story of science right inyou know from Copernicus on it's like
 you know first we were like convinced a planets at the center of the universe nothat's not true well then we will
 convince there something very special about the chemistry that we have asbiological organisms now that's not
 really true and then we're still holding out that hope or this intelligence thingwe have that's really special yeah I
 don't think it is however in a sense as you say it's kind of liberating for thefollowing reason that you realize that
 what's special is the details of us not some abstract attribute that you know wecould wonder Oh is something else going
 to come along and you know also have that abstract attribute wellyes every abstract attribute we have
 something else has it but the full details of our kind of history of ourcivilization and so on nothing else has
 that that's what you know that's our story so to speak and that's sort of onemost by definition
 special so I I view it as not being such a I mean I was initially I was like thisis bad this is this is kind of you know
 how can we have self-respect about some about the things that we do then Irealized the details of the things we do
 they are the story everything else is kind of a blank canvas so maybe on a

0:12:11
Speaker 0 :small tangent you just made me think of
 it but what do you make of the monolith in 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of alienscommunicating with us and sparking the
 the kind of particular intelligent computation that we humans have is thereanything interesting to get from that


0:12:34
Speaker 1 :sci-fi yeah I mean I think what's what's
 fun about that is you know the monoliths are these you know one to four to nineperfect cuboid things and in the you
 know earth four million years ago whatever they will pertain with a bunchof apes and so on
 a thing that has that level of perfection seems out of place it seemsvery kind of constructed very engineered
 so that's an interesting question what is the you know what's the technosignature so to speak what is it that
 you see it somewhere and you say my gosh that had to be engineered um now thefact is
 we see crystals which are also very perfect and you know that the perfectones are very perfect they're nice
 polyhedra or whatever um and so in that sense if you say well it's a sign ofsort of it's a techno signature that
 it's a perfect you know a perfect polygonal shape polyhedral shape that'snot true and so then it's it's an
 interesting question what what is the you know what is the right signature Imean like you know Gauss famous
 mathematician you know he had this idea you should cut down the Siberian forestin the shape of sort of a typical image
 of the proof of the Pythagorean theorem on the grounds that there's a kind ofcool idea didn't get done but um you
 know it's on the grounds that the Martians would see that and realize goshthere are mathematicians out there it's
 kind of you know it's the in his theory of the world that was probably the bestadvertisement for the cultural
 achievements of our species um but you know it's it's a it's a reasonablequestion what do you what can you send
 or create that is a sign of intelligence in its creation or even intention in its

0:14:20
Speaker 0 :creation you talk about if we were to
 send a beacon can you what what should we send is math our greatest creation is

0:14:30
Speaker 1 :what is our greatest creation I think I
 think in it's a it's a philosophically doomed issue so I mean in other wordsyou send something you think it's
 fantastic but it's kind of like we are part of the universe we make things thatare you know things that happen in the
 universe computation which is sort of the thing that we are in some abstractsent you then sense using to create all
 these elaborate things we create is surprisingly ubiquitous in other wordswe might have thought that you know
 we've built this whole giant engineering stack that's led us to microprocessorsthat's led us to be able to do elaborate
 computations but this idea the computations are happening all over theplace the only question is whether
 whether there's a thread that connects our human intentions to what thosecomputations are and so I think I think
 this question of what do you send to kind of show off our civilization inthe best possible way I think any kind
 of almost random slab of stuff we've produced is about equivalent toeverything else I think it's one of
 these things where it's a non romantic

0:15:40
Speaker 0 :way of phrasing it I just started to
 interrupt but I just talked to it up Andrew in who's the wife of crosshanging uh-huh and so I don't know if
 you're familiar with the Voyager it's just part of its ascending I thinkbrainwaves of you know I wasn't it hers


0:15:57
Speaker 1 :

0:16:00
Speaker 0 :it was yeah her brain waves when she was
 first falling in love with Carl Sagan right it's this beautiful story right

0:16:04
Speaker 1 :

0:16:06
Speaker 0 :that brand that perhaps you would shut
 down the power of that by saying we might as well send anything else andthat's interesting all of it is kind of
 an interesting peculiar thing that's

0:16:17
Speaker 1 :yeah yeah right well I mean I think it's
 kind of interesting to see on the on the Voyager you know golden record thing oneof the things that's kind of cute about
 that is you know it was made one was it in the late seventies early eightiesyeah um and you know one of the things
 it's a phonograph record okay and it has a diagram how to play aphonograph record and you know it's kind
 of like it's shocking that in just 30 years if you show that to a random kidof today and you show them that diagram
 I've tried this experiment they're like I don't know what the heck this is andthe best anybody can think of is you
 know take the whole record forget the fact that it has some kind of helicaltrack in it just image the whole thing
 and see what's there that's what we would do today in only 30 years ourtechnology has kind of advanced to the
 point where the playing of a helical you know mechanical track on a phonographrecord is now something bizarre so you
 know it's it's that's a cautionary tale I would say in terms of the ability tomake something that in detail sort of
 leads by the nose some you know the aliens or whatever to do something it'slike no you know best you can do as I
 say if we were doing this today we would not build a helical scan thing with aneedle we would just take some high
 resolution imaging system and get all the bits off itsay oh it's a big nuisance that they put
 in a helix you know the spiral let's sum let's just you know unravel the spiraland then start from there do you think


0:17:49
Speaker 0 :and this will get into trying to figure
 out interpretability of AI interpretability of computation beingable to communicate with various kinds
 of computations do you think would be able to if you're put put your alien haton figure out this record how to play


0:18:10
Speaker 1 :this record well it's a question of what
 one wants to do I mean understand what

0:18:14
Speaker 0 :the other party was trying to
 communicate or understand anything about

0:18:20
Speaker 1 :the other party what is understanding
 mean I mean that's the issue the issue is it's like what people were trying todo natural language understanding for
 computers right so people try to do that for years it wasn't clear what it meantin other words you take your piece of
 English or whatever and you say gosh my computer has understood this okay that'snice what can you do with that well so
 for example when we did you know built wolf malphur um you know one of thethings was it's you know it's doing
 question answering and so on it needs to do natural language understanding thereason that I realized after the fact
 the reason we were able to do natural language understanding quite well andpeople hadn't before the number one
 thing was we had an actual objective for the natural language understand and wewere trying to turn the natural language
 into commentation into this computational language that we couldthen do things with now similarly when
 you imagine your alien you say okay we're playing them the record did theyunderstand it well it depends what you
 mean if they you know if we if there's a representation that they have if itconverts to some representation where we
 can say oh yes that is a that's a representation that we can recognize isrepresents understanding then all well
 and good but actually the only ones that I think we can say would representunderstanding a ones that will then do
 things that we humans kind of recognize as being useful to us maybe a trying to

0:19:47
Speaker 0 :understand quantify how
 technological advances particular civilization is so are they a threat tous from a military perspective yeah yeah
 that's probably the kind of first kind of understanding that would be

0:20:02
Speaker 1 :interested in gosh that's so hard I mean
 that's like in the arrival movie that was sort of one of the key questions asis you know why are you here so to speak


0:20:11
Speaker 0 :and it's I using a hurtis right but but


0:20:12
Speaker 1 :even that is that you know it's a very
 unclear you know it's like the the are you gonna hurt us that comes back to alot of interesting area fix questions
 because the you know we might make an AI that says blood take autonomous cars forinstance you know are you gonna hurt us
 well let's make sure you only drive at precisely the speed limit because wewant to make sure we don't hurt you so
 to speak because that's some and then well something you know but you say butactually that means I'm gonna be really
 late for this thing and you know that sort of hurts me in some way so it'shard to know even even the definition of
 what it means to hurt yeah someone is unclear and as we start thinking aboutthings about AI ethics and so on that's
 you know something one has to address

0:20:56
Speaker 0 :there's always trade-offs and that's the
 annoying thing about ethics yeah well

0:20:59
Speaker 1 :right and I mean I think ethics like
 these other things we're talking about is a deeply human thing if there's noabstract you know let's write down the
 theorem that proves that this is ethically correct that's a that's ameaningless idea you know you have to
 have a ground truth so to speak that's ultimately sort of what humans want andthey don't all want the same thing so
 that gives one all kinds of additional complexity and thinking about that one

0:21:27
Speaker 0 :convenient thing in terms of turning
 ethics into computation you ask the question of what maximizes thelikelihood of the survival of the


0:21:37
Speaker 1 :species that's a good existential issue
 but then when you say survival of the species right you might say um you mightfor example for example let's say forget
 about technology just you know hang out and you know be happy live our lives goon to the next generation and you know
 go through many many generations where in a sense nothing is happening thatokay is that not okay hard to know in
 terms of the attempt to do elaborate things andthe attempt to might be
 counterproductive for the survival of the specieslike for instance I mean in in you know
 I think it's it's also a little bit hard to know so ok let's take that as a sortof thought experiment ok you know you
 can say well what are the threats that we might have to survive you know thesupervolcano the asteroid impact the you
 know all these kinds of things ok so now we inventory these possible threats andwe say let's make our species as robust
 as possible relative to all these threats I think in the end it's a it'ssort of an unknowable thing what what it
 takes to you know so so given that you've got this AI and you've told itmaximize the long term what is long term
 mean does long term mean until the sun burns out that's that's not gonna workand you know does long term mean next
 thousand years ok they're probably optimizations for the next thousandyears that it's like it's like if you're
 running a company you can make a company be very stable for a certain period oftime like if you know if your company
 gets bought by some you know private investment group then they'll you knowyou can you can run a company just fine
 for five years by just taking what it does and you know removing all R&D andthe company will burn out after a while
 but it'll run just fine for a while so if you tell the AI keep the humans okayfor a thousand years there's probably a
 certain set of things that one would do to optimize that many of which one mightsay well that would be a pretty big
 shame for the future of history so to speak for that to be what happens but Ithink I think in the end you know as you
 start thinking about that question it is what you realize is there's a whole sortof raft of undecidability computational
 irreducibility in other words it's I mean one of the good things about sortof the the the what our civilization has
 gone through and what sort of we humans go through is that there's a certaincomputational irreducibility to it in
 the sense that it isn't the case you can look from the outside and just say theanswer is going to be this
 at the end of the day this is what's gonna happen you actually have to gothrough the process to find out and I
 think that's um that's both that feels better in the sense it's not a you knowsomething is achieved by going through
 all of this all of this process and it's but it also means that telling the a Igo figure out you know what will be the
 best outcome well unfortunately it's going to come back and say it's kind ofundecidable what to do we'd have to run
 all of those scenarios to see what happens and if we want it for theinfinite future
 we're throwing immediately into a sort of standard issues of of kind ofinfinite computation and so on so yeah


0:25:01
Speaker 0 :even if you get that the answer to the
 universe and everything is 42 you still have to actually run the universe yes

0:25:08
Speaker 1 :

0:25:09
Speaker 0 :yes like the question I guess or the the
 you know the the journey is the point

0:25:15
Speaker 1 :right well I think it's saying to
 summarize this is the result of the universe yeah that's if that is possibleit tells us I mean the whole sort of
 structure of thinking about computation and so on and thinking about how stuffworks if if there if it's possible to
 say and the answer is such-and-such you're basically saying there's a way ofgoing outside the universe and you're
 kind of you're getting yourself into something of a sort of paradox becauseyou're saying if it's knowable what the
 answer is then there's a way to know it that is beyond what the universeprovides but if we can know it then
 something that we're dealing with is beyond the universe so then the universeisn't the universe so to speak so and in


0:26:00
Speaker 0 :general as we'll talk about at least for
 small human brains it's hard to show that the result of a sufficientlycomplex computation it's hard I mean
 it's probably impossible right and there's a side ability so and theuniverse appears by at least the poets
 to be sufficiently complex they won't be able to predict what the heck it's all

0:26:29
Speaker 1 :going to well we better not be able to
 because if we can kind of denies I mean it's you knowwe're part of the universe yeah so what
 does it mean for us to predict it means that we that our little part of theuniverse is able to jump ahead of the
 whole universe and you know this this quickly winds up I mean that there it isconceivable the only way we'd be able to
 predict is if we are so special in the universe we are the one place wherethere is computation more special more
 sophisticated than anything else that exists in the universe that's the onlyway we would have the ability to sort of
 the almost theological ability so to speak to predict what happens in theuniverse is to say somehow we're we're
 better than everything else in the universe which I don't think is the case

0:27:16
Speaker 0 :yeah perhaps we can detect a large
 number of looping patterns that reoccur throughout the universe and fullydescribe them and therefore but then
 it's it still becomes exceptionally difficult to see how those patterns

0:27:32
Speaker 1 :interact and what kind of well look the
 most remarkable thing about the universe is that it has regularity at all mightnot be the case if you don't have
 regularity absolutely therefore it's full of I mean physics is successful youknow it's full of of laws that tell us a
 lot of detail about how the universe works I mean it could be the case thatyou know the 10 to the 90th particles in
 the universe they will do their own thing but they don't they all followedwe already know they all follow
 basically physical the same physical laws and that's something that's a veryprofound fact about the universe what
 conclusion you draw from that is unclear I mean in the you know the early earlytheologians that was you know exhibit
 number one for the existence of God now you know people have differentconclusions about it
 but the fact is you know right now I mean I happen to be interested actuallyI've just restarted a long-running kind
 of interest of mine about fundamental physics I'm kind of like come on I'm ona bit of a quest which I'm about to make
 more public of to to see if I can actually find the fundamental theory of

0:28:40
Speaker 0 :physics excellence we'll come to that
 and I just had a lot of conversation with quantum mechanics folks with so I'mreally excited on your take because I
 think you have a fascinating take on the the the fundamental notch in nature ofour reality from a physics perspective
 so and what might be underlying the kind of physics as we think of it today okaylet's take a step back what is


0:29:08
Speaker 1 :computation it's a good question
 operationally computation is following rules that's kind of itI mean computation is the result is the
 process of systematically following rules and it is the thing that happens

0:29:24
Speaker 0 :when you do that for taking initial
 conditions are taking inputs and following rules I mean what are youfollowing rules on so there has to be
 some data some not necessarily it can be

0:29:34
Speaker 1 :something where that there's a you know
 very simple input and then you're following these rules and you'd saythere's not really much data going into
 this it's you could actually pack the initial conditions into the rule if youwant to um so I think the the question
 is is there a robust notion of computation that is what is this lastmean what I mean by that is something
 like this so so one of the things that are different in an earlier physicssomething like energy okay the different
 forms of energy there's but somehow energy is the robust concept thatdoesn't isn't particular to kinetic
 energy or you know nuclear energy or whatever else there's a robust idea ofenergy so only things you might ask is
 there's the robust idea of computation or does it matter that this computationis running in a Turing machine this
 computation is running in as you know CMOS Salkin CPU this computation isrunning in a fluid system in the whether
 those kinds of things or is there a robust idea of computation thattranscends the sort of detailed
 framework that it's running in okay and is that her yes I mean it wasn't obviousthat there was so it's worth
 understanding the history and how we got to where we are right now because youknow to say that there is is a statement
 in part about our universe it's not a statement about what ismathematically conceivable it's about
 what actually can exist for us maybe you

0:31:03
Speaker 0 :can also comment because energy as a
 concept is robust but there's also its intricate complicated relationship withmatter with mass is very interesting of
 particles that carry force and particles that sort of particles that carryforcing particles that have mass these
 kinds of ideas they seem to map to each other at least in the mathematical senseis there a connection between energy and
 mass and computation or are these completely disjoint ideas we don't know

0:31:43
Speaker 1 :yet the things that I'm trying to do
 about fundamental physics may well lead to such a connection but there is noknown connection at this time so key can


0:31:54
Speaker 0 :you elaborate a little bit more on what
 how do you think about computation what

0:32:01
Speaker 1 :is company yeah so I mean let's let's
 tell a little bit of a historical story yes okay so you know back go back 150years people were making mechanical
 calculators of various kinds and you know the typical thing was do you wantan adding machine you go to the adding
 machine store basically he wants a multiplying machine you go to themultiplying machine store that different
 pieces of hardware and so that means that at least at the level of that kindof computation and those kinds of pieces
 of hardware there isn't a robust notion of computationthere's the adding machine kind of
 computation there's the multiplying machinenotion of computation and they're
 disjoint so what happened in around 1900 people started imagining particularly inthe contests of mathematical logic could
 you have something which would be represent any reasonable function rightand they came up with things this idea
 of primitive recursion was one of the early ideas and it didn't work therewere reasonable functions that people
 who come up with that were not represented using the primitive as aprimitive recursion okay so then then
 along comes 1931 and girdle's theorem and so onand as in looking back one can see that
 as part of the process of establishing girdles theorem girdle basically showedhow you could compile arithmetic you
 could basically compile logical statements like this statement isunprovable into arithmetic so what he
 essentially did was to show that arithmetic can be a computer in a sensethat's capable of representing all kinds
 of other things and then Turing came along 1936 came up with Turing machinesmeanwhile Alonzo Church had come up with
 lambda calculus and the surprising thing that was established very quickly is theTuring machine idea about what might be
 what computation might be is exactly the same as the lambda calculus idea of whatcomputation might be and so and then
 there started to be other ideas you know register machines other kinds of otherkinds of representations of computation
 and the big surprise was they all turned out to be equivalent so in other wordsit might have been the case like those
 old adding machines and multiplying machines that you know Turing had hisidea of computation church had his idea
 of computation and they were just different but it isn't true there areactually all equivalent so then by I
 would say the the 1970s or so in in sort of the computation computer sciencecomputation theory area people had sort
 of said Oh Turing machines are kind of what computation is physicists werestill holding out saying no no no it's
 just not how the universe works we've got all these differential equationswe've got all these real numbers that
 have infinite numbers of digits

0:34:43
Speaker 0 :the universe is now a Turing machine


0:34:44
Speaker 1 :right the you know the Turing machines
 are a small subset of that the things that we make in microprocessors andengineering structures and so on so
 probably actually through my work in the 1980s about sort of the relationshipbetween computation and models of
 physics it became a little less clear that there would be that there was thisbig sort of dichotomy between what can
 happen in physics and what happens and things like Turing machines and I thinkprobably by now people would mostly
 think and and by the way brains were another kind of elementsthis I mean you know girdle didn't think
 that his notion of computational what amounted to his notion of computationwould cover brains and Turing wasn't
 sure either um but tell though he was a little bithe got to be a little bit more convinced
 that it should cover brains um but so you know but I would say by probablysometime in the 1980s there was
 beginning to be so a general belief that yes this notion of computation thatcould be captured by things like Turing
 machines was reasonably robust now the next question is ok you can have auniversal Turing machine that's capable
 of being programmed to do anything that any Turing machine can do um and youknow this idea of universal computation
 it's an important idea this idea that you can have one piece of hardware andprogram it with different pieces of
 software you know that's kind of the idea that launched most moderntechnology I mean that's kind of that
 that's the idea that launched computer revolution software etc so importantidea but but the thing that's still kind
 of holding out from that idea is ok there is this Universal computationthing but seems hard to get to it seems
 like you want to make a universal computer you have to kind of have amicroprocessor with you know a million
 gates in it and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something thatachieves that level of computational
 sophistication ok so the surprise for me was that stuff that I discovered in theearly 80s I'm looking at these things
 called cellular automata which are really simple computational systems thething that was a big surprise to me was
 that even when their rules were very very simple they were doing things thatwere as sophisticated as they did even
 when their rules much more complicated so it didn't look like you know thisidea Oh to get sophisticated computation
 you have to build something with very sophisticated rulesthat idea didn't seem to pan out and
 instead it seemed to be the case that sophisticated computation was completelyubiquitous even in systems with
 incredibly simple rules and so that led to this thing that I call the principleof computational equivalence which
 basically says when you have a system that follows rules of any kind thenwhenever the system isn't doing things
 that are in some sense obviously simple then the computation that the behaviorof the system corresponds to is of
 equivalent sophistication so that means that when you kind of go from the veryvery very simplest things you can
 imagine then quite quickly you hit this kind of threshold above which everythingis equivalent in its computational
 sophistication not obvious that would be the case I mean that's a science fact

0:38:10
Speaker 0 :well then hold on a second
 you saw this you've opened with a new kind of science I mean I remember it wasa huge eye-opener
 that's such simple things can create such complexity and yes there's anequivalence but it's not a fact it just
 appears to I mean it's as much as a fact as sort of these theories are so elegantthat it it seems to be the way things
 are but let me ask sort of you just brought up previously kind of like thecommunities of computer scientists with
 their touring machines the physicists will their universe and the whoever theheck maybe neuroscientists looking at
 the brain what's your sense in the equivalence you've shown through yourwork that simple rules can create
 equivalently complex touring machine systems right is the universe equivalentto the kinds of tutorial machines is the
 human brain a kind of toy machine do you see those things basically blendingtogether or is there still a mystery
 about how disjoint they're well my guess

0:39:24
Speaker 1 :is that they will blend together but we
 don't know that for sure yet I mean this I you know I should say I I said ratherglibly that the principle of
 computational equivalence is sort of a science fact and this I was using halfwas yes efforts for the for the for the
 science fact because when you it is a I mean just to talk about that for asecond and most people will um
 the thing is that it is it has a complicated epistemological charactersimilar to things like the second law of
 thermodynamics law of entropy increase the you know what is the second law ofthermodynamics it is is it a law of
 nature is that a thing that is true of the physical world is it is it somethingwhich is mathematically provable is it
 something which happens to be true of the systems that we see in the world isit in some sense a definition of heat
 perhaps well it's a combination of those things and it's the same thing with theprinciple of computational equivalence
 and in some sense the principle of computational equivalence is at theheart of the definition of computation
 because it's telling you there is a thing there is a robust notion that isequivalent across all these systems and
 doesn't depend on the details of each individual system and that's why we canmeaningfully talk about a thing called
 computation and we're not stuck talking about over there's computation intrillion machine number 378 5 and etc
 etc etc that's that's why there is a robust notion like that now on the otherhand can we prove the principle of
 computational equivalence can we can we prove it as a mathematical result wellthe answer is actually we've got some
 nice results along those lines that say you know throw me a random system withvery simple rules well in a couple of
 cases we now know that even the very simplest rules we can imagine of acertain type are universal and do sort
 of follow what you would expect from the principle of computational equivalenceso that's a nice piece of sort of
 mathematical evidence for the principle of computational equivalence did you

0:41:28
Speaker 0 :still enjoy on that point the simple
 rules creating sort of these complex behaviors but is there a way tomathematically say that this behavior is
 complex that you've mentioned you cross

0:41:46
Speaker 1 :a threshold right is the various
 indicators so for example one thing would be is it capable of universalcomputation that is given the system do
 there exist initial conditions for the system that can be set up to essentiallyrepresent programs to do anything you
 to compute primes to compute pi to do whatever he wants right so that's anindicator so we know in a couple of
 examples that yes the simplest candidates that could conceivably havethat property do have that property and
 that's what the principle of computational equivalence might suggestbut this principle of computational
 equivalence one question about it is is it true for the physical world right itmight be true for all these things we
 come up with the Turing machines the cellular automata whatever else is ittrue for our actual physical world is it
 true for the Bray brains which are an element of the physical world we don'tknow for sure and that's not the type of
 question that we will have a definitive answer to because it's you know it's ait's a there's a there's a sort of
 scientific induction issue you can say what's true for all these brains butthis person over here is really special
 and it's not true for them and you can't you know the the the only way that thatcannot be what happens is if we finally
 nail it and actually get a fundamental theory for physics and it turns out tocorrespond to let's say a simple program
 if that is the case then we will basically have reduced physics to abranch of mathematics in a sense that we
 will not be you know right now with physics we're like well this is thetheory that you know this is the rules
 that apply here but in the middle of that you know you know right by thatblack hole
 maybe these rules don't apply and something else applies and there may beanother piece of the onion that we have
 to peel back but as if if we can get to the point where we actually have this isthe fundamental theory of physics here
 it is it's this program run this program and you will get our universe then we'vekind of reduced the problem of figuring
 out things in physics to a problem of doing some what turns out to be verydifficult irreducibly difficult
 mathematical problems but it no longer is the case that we can say thatsomebody can come in and say whoops you
 know you were right about all these things about Turing machines but you'rewrong about the physical universe we
 know there's sort of ground truth about what's happening the physical universenow I happen to think I mean you asked
 me at an interesting time because I'm just in the middle of starting tore-energized my my project to kind of
 study the fundamental theory of physics as of today I'm very optimistic thatwe're actually going to find something
 and that it's going to be possible to to see that the universe really iscomputational in that sense but I don't
 know because we're betting against you know we're betting against the universesort of speaking I didn't you know it's
 not like you know when I spend a lot of my life building technology and then Iknow what what's in there right and it's
 there maybe it may have unexpected behavior may have bugs things like thatbut fundamentally I know what's in there
 for the universe I'm not in that position so to speak

0:44:55
Speaker 0 :what kind of computation do you think
 the fundamental laws of physics might emerge from so just to clarify sothere's you've you've done a lot of
 fascinating work with kind of discrete kinds of computation that you know usecellular automata and we'll talk about
 it have this very clean structure it's such a nice way to demonstrate thatsimple rules can create immense
 complexity but what you know is that actually our cellular time issufficiently general to describe the
 kinds of computation that might create the laws of physics just to give it canyou give a sense of what kind of
 computation do you think would create

0:45:39
Speaker 1 :well so so this is a slightly
 complicated issue because as soon as you have universal computation you can inprinciple simulate anything with
 anything but it is not a natural thing to do and if you're asking will you totry to find our physical universe by
 looking at possible programs in the computational universe of all possibleprograms would the ones that correspond
 to our universe be small and simple enough that we might find them bysearching that computational universe we
 got to have the right basis so to speak we have to have the right language ineffect for describing computation for
 that to be feasible so the thing that I've been interested in for a long timeis what are the most structureless
 structures that we can create with computation so in other words if you saya cellular automaton as a bunch of cells
 they're arrayed on a grid and it's very you know anevery cell is updated in synchrony at
 the sir at a particular you know when there's a there's a click of a clocksort of speaking it goes a tick of a
 clock and that every cell gets updated at the same time that's a very specificvery rigid kind of thing but my guess is
 that when we look at physics and we look at things like space and time thatwhat's underneath space and time is
 something as structureless as possible that what we see what emerges for us asphysical space for example comes from
 something that is sort of arbitrarily unstructured underneath and so I've beenfor a long time interested in kind of
 what what are the most structureless structures that we can set up andactually what I had thought about for
 ages is using graphs networks where essentially so they'll throw that spacefor example so what is space the kind of
 a question one might ask back in the early days of quantum mechanics forexample people said oh for sure space is
 going to be discrete because all these other things were finding a discrete butthat never worked out in physics and so
 space and physics today is always treated as this continuous thing justlike Euclid imagined it I mean the the
 very first thing you chlid says and his sort of common notions is you know apoint is something which has no part in
 other words there are there are points that are arbitrarily small and there's acontinuum of possible positions of
 points and the question is is that true and so for example if we look at I don'tknow fluid like air or water we might
 say oh it's a continuous fluid we can pour it we can do all kinds of thingscontinuously but actually we know
 because we know the physics of it that it consists of a bunch of discretemolecules bouncing around and only in
 the aggregate is it behaving like a continuum and so the possibility existsthat that's true of space too people
 haven't managed to make that work with existing frameworks and physics but I'vebeen interested in whether one can
 imagine that underneath space and also underneath time is something morestructureless and the question is is it
 computational so there are couple possibilities it could be computationalsomehow fundamentally equivalent to a
 Turing machine or it could be fundamentally not so how could it not beit could not be so
 machine essentially deals with integers whole numbers some level and you know itcan do things like it can add one to a
 number it can do things like this you

0:48:52
Speaker 0 :can also store whatever the heck it did


0:48:54
Speaker 1 :yes it has an infinite storage the
 storage but what temp when one thinks about doing physics or sort of idealizedphysics or idealized mathematics one can
 deal with real numbers numbers with an infinite number of digits numbers whichare absolutely precise someone can say
 we can take this number and we can multiply it by itself are you

0:49:16
Speaker 0 :comfortable with infinity in this
 context are you gone very well in a context of computation do you thinkinfinity and plays a part I think that


0:49:24
Speaker 1 :the role infinity is complicated
 infinity is useful in conceptualizing things it's not actual izybellealmost by definition it's not actual I


0:49:35
Speaker 0 :zabit do you think infinity is part of
 the thing that might underlie the laws

0:49:39
Speaker 1 :of physics I think that um no I think
 there are many questions that you asked about you might ask about physics whichinevitably involve infinity like when
 you say you know is faster-than-light travel possible you could say with itwith with it we're given the laws of
 physics can you make something even arbitrarily large even quotes infinitelylarge that you know that will make
 faster-than-light travel possible then you you're thrown into dealing withinfinity as a kind of theoretical
 question but I mean talking about you know sort of what's underneath space andtime and what how one can make you know
 a computational infrastructure one possibility is that you can't make acomputational infrastructure and Turing
 such in sense that you really have to be dealing with precise real numbers you'redealing with partial differential
 equations which just have precise real numbers that arbitrarily closelyseparated points you have a continuum
 forever thing could be that that that's what happens that there's sort of acontinuum for everything and precise
 real numbers for everything and then the things I'm thinking about are wrong andyou know that's that's the risk you take
 if you're you know if you're trying to sort of do things about nature is youmight just be wrong it's not it's for me
 personally it's kind of strange things I've spent a lot of my life buildingtechnology
 where you can do something that nobody cares about but you can't be sort ofwrong in that sense and the sense you
 build your technology and it does what it does but but I think you know thisquestion of what you know what the sort
 of underlying computational infrastructure for the universe might beum it's so it's sort of inevitable it's
 gonna be fairly abstract because if you're gonna get all these things likethere are three dimensions of space
 there are electrons there are muons there are quarks there are this youdon't get to if the if the model for the
 universe is simple you don't get to have sort of a line of code for each of thosethings you don't get to have sort of the
 the the muon case the Tau lepton case and so on or as they're all have to be

0:51:39
Speaker 0 :emergent some right so something deeper


0:51:42
Speaker 1 :right so so that means it's sort of
 inevitable that's a little hard to talk about what the sort of underlyingstructural is structure actually is do


0:51:50
Speaker 0 :you think our human beings have the
 cognitive capacity to understand if we're to discover it to understand thekinds of simple structure from which
 these laws can emerge like do you think

0:52:02
Speaker 1 :that's a good class pursuit well here's
 what I think I think that I mean I'm right in the middle of this right nowI'm telling you that I think you this
 one yeah I mean this human has a hard time understanding it you know a bunchof the things that are going on but but
 what happens in understanding is one builds waypoints I mean if you saidunderstand modern 21st century
 mathematics starting from you know counting back in you know whenevercounting was invented 50,000 years ago
 whenever it was right there's that will be really difficult but what happens iswe build waypoints that allow us to get
 to higher levels of understanding and we see the same thing happening in languageyou know when we invent a word for
 something it provides kind of a cognitive anchor a kind of a waypointsthat lets us you know like a podcast or
 something you could be explaining well it's a thing which this works this waythat way the other way but as soon as
 you have the word podcast and people kind of societally understand it youstart to be able to build on top of that
 and so I think and that that's kind of the story of science actually - I meanscience is about building these kind of
 waypoints where we find this sort of cognitivemechanism for understanding something
 then we can build on top of it you know we we have the idea of I don't knowdifferential equations we can build on
 top of that we have this idea of that idea so my hope is that if it is thecase that we have to go all the way sort
 of from the sand to the computer and there's no way points in between thenwe're toast we won't be able to do that


0:53:34
Speaker 0 :well eventually we might so for if we're
 as clever apes are good enough a building those abstract abstractionseventually from sanh we'll get to the
 computer a and it just might be a longer

0:53:44
Speaker 1 :journey the question is whether it is
 something that you asked whether our human brains yeswell on will quotes understand what's
 going on and that's a different question because for that it requires steps thatare for whether it is sort of from which
 we can construct a human understandable narrative and that's something that Ithink I am somewhat hopeful that that
 will be possible although you know as of literally today if you ask me I'mconfronted with things that I don't
 understand very well um and so this is a

0:54:16
Speaker 0 :small pattern in a computation trying to
 understand the rules under which the computation functions and yeah it's it'san interesting possibility under which
 kinds of computations such a creature

0:54:30
Speaker 1 :can understand itself my guess is that
 within so we didn't talk much about computational irreducibility but it's aconsequence of this principle of
 computational equivalence and it's sort of a core idea that that one has tounderstand I think which is question is
 you're doing a computation you can figure out what happens in thecomputation just by running every step
 in the computation and seeing what happens or you can say let me jump aheadand figure out you know have something
 smarter that figures out what's gonna happen before it actually happens and alot of traditional science has been
 about that act of computational reduce ability it's like we've got theseequations and we can just solve them or
 we can figure out what's going to happen we don't have to trace all of thosesteps we just jump ahead because we've
 solved these equations okay so one of the things that is a consequence of theprinciple of computational equivalence
 is you don't always get to do that many many systems will be computationallyirreducible
 in the sense that the only way to find out what they do is just follow eachstep and see what happens why is that
 well if you have if you're saying well we with our brains will are smarter wewe don't have to mess around like the
 little cellular automata and going through and updating all those cells wecan just you know use the power of our
 brains to jump ahead but if the principle of computational occurrence isright that's not going to be correct
 because it means that there's us during our computation in our brains there's alittle cellular automaton doing its
 computation and the principle of computational current says these twocomputations are fundamentally
 equivalent so that means we don't get to say we're a lot smarter than thecellular automaton and jump ahead
 because we're just doing computation that's of the same sophistication as thecellular automaton itself that's


0:56:11
Speaker 0 :computation or disability it's
 fascinating but the and that's a really powerful ideaI think that's both depressing and
 humbling and so on that were all we in a cellular automata are the same but thequestion we're talking about the
 fundamental laws of physics is kind of the reverse question you're notpredicting what's gonna happen you have
 to run the universe for that but saying can I understand what rules likely

0:56:37
Speaker 1 :generated me I understand but the
 problem is to know whether you're right you have to have some computationalreduce ability because we are embedded
 in the universe if the only way to know whether we get the universe is just torun the universe we don't get to do that
 because it just ran for fourteen point six billion years or whatever and wedon't you know we can't rerun it so to
 speak so we have to hope that there are pockets of computational reducibilitysufficient to be able to say yes I can
 recognize those or electrons there and and and I think that it is a it's afeature of computational irreducibility
 it's sort of a mathematical feature that there are always an infinite collectionof pockets of reduced ability the
 question of whether they land in the right place and whether we can sort ofbuild the theory based on them is
 unclear but to this point about you know whether we as observers in the universebuilt out of the same stuff as the
 universe can figure out the universe so to speak that relies on these pockets ofreducibility without the pockets of
 reducibility it's won't work work but I think this question about howobservers operate it's one of the
 features of science over the last hundred years particularly has been thatevery time we get more realistic about
 observers we learn a bit more about science so for example relativity wasall about observers don't get to say
 when you know what's simultaneous with what they have to just wait for thelight signal to arrive to decide what
 simultaneous or for example in thermodynamics observers don't get tosay the position of every single
 molecule and a gas they can only see the kind of large scale features and that'swhy the second law of thermodynamics law
 of entropy increased and so on works if you could see every individual moleculeyou wouldn't conclude something about
 thermodynamics you would conclude oh these molecules just all doing theseparticular things you wouldn't be able
 to see this aggregate fact so I strongly expect that in fact him the theoriesthat I have the one has to be more
 realistic about the computation and other aspects of observers in order toactually make a correspondence between
 what we experience in fact they have a my little team and I have a littletheory right now about how quantum
 mechanics may work which is a very wonderfully bizarre idea about how asort of thread of human consciousness
 relates to what we observe in the universe but this is the several stepsto explain what that's about


0:59:07
Speaker 0 :woody meek of the mess of the observer
 at the lower level of quantum mechanics sort of the textbook definition withquantum mechanics kind of says that
 there's some there's two worlds one is the world that actually is and the otheris that's observed do ya what do you


0:59:26
Speaker 1 :

0:59:27
Speaker 0 :

0:59:28
Speaker 1 :make sense of well I think actually the
 ideas we've recently had might actually give away into this and that's I don'tknow yet I mean it's I think that's it's
 a mess I mean the fact is there is a one of the things that's interesting andwhen you know people look at these
 models that I started talking about 30 years ago nowthey say oh no that can't possibly be
 right you know what about quantum mechanics right you say okay tell mewhat is the essence of quantum mechanics
 what do you want me to be able to reproduce to know that I've got quantummechanics so to speak well and that
 question comes up it comes up very operationally actually because we'vebeen doing a bunch of stuff with quantum
 computing and there are all these companies that say we have a quantumcomputer and we say let's connect to
 your API and let's actually run it and they're like well maybe you shouldn't dothat yet
 we're not quite ready yet and one of the questions that I've been curious aboutis if I have five minutes with a quantum
 computer how can I tell if it's really a quantum computer or whether it's asimulator at the other end right and
 turns out it's really hard it turns out there isn't it's it's it's like a lot ofthese questions about sort of what is
 intelligence what's life it's soaring

1:00:40
Speaker 0 :tears for quantum computing that's right


1:00:41
Speaker 1 :that's right it's like are you really a
 quantum computer and I mean I think simulation the yes exactly is it just asimulation or is it really a quantum
 computer famous you're all over again but but that so you know this this wholeissue about the sort of mathematical
 structure of quantum mechanics and the completely separate thing that is ourexperience in which we think definite
 things happen but as quantum mechanics doesn't say definite things ever happenquantum mechanics is all about the
 amplitudes for different things to happen but yet our thread ofconsciousness operates as if definite
 things are happening but to linger on

1:01:21
Speaker 0 :the point you've kind of mentioned the
 structure that could underlie everything in this idea that it could perhaps havesomething like a structure of a graph
 can you elaborate why your intuition is that there's a graph structure of nodesand edges and what it might represent


1:01:41
Speaker 1 :right okay so the question is what is in
 a sense the most structureless structure you can imagine right so and in factwhat I've recently realized in the last
 year or so I have a new most structureless structure by the way the

1:01:59
Speaker 0 :question itself is a beautiful and a
 powerful one in itself so even without an answer just the question is

1:02:06
Speaker 1 :strong question right right well what's


1:02:07
Speaker 0 :

1:02:08
Speaker 1 :your new idea well it has to do with
 hypergraphs essentially what what is interestingabout the sort of ID model I have now is
 it's a little bit like what happened with computation everything that I thinkof as oh well maybe the model is this I
 discover its equivalent and that's quite encouraging becauseit's like I could say well I'm gonna
 look at trivalent graph the graphs with you know three edges for each node andso on or I could look at this special
 kind of graph or I could look at this kind of algebraic structure and turnsout that the things I'm now looking at
 everything that I've imagined that is a plausible type of structuraliststructure is equivalent to this so what
 is it well a typical way to think about it is well so you might have some somecollection of tuples collection of let's
 say numbers so you might have one three five two three four little justcollections of numbers triples of
 numbers let's say quadruples of numbers pairs of numbers whatever and you haveall these sort of floating little tuples
 they're not in any particular order and that sort of floating collection oftuples and I told you this was abstract
 represents the whole universe the only thing that relates them is when a symbolis the same it's the same so to speak so
 if you have two tuples and they contain the same symbol let's say at the sameposition of the tuple of the first
 element of the tuple then that's represents a relation okay so let me letme try and peel this back Wow okay it's


1:03:55
Speaker 0 :

1:03:55
Speaker 1 :it's I told you it's abstract but this
 is this is the this is so the

1:03:59
Speaker 0 :relationship is formed by the same some


1:04:03
Speaker 1 :aspect of sameness right but but so
 think about it in terms of a graph yeah so a graph a bunch of nodes let's sayyou number each node okay then what is a
 graph a graph is a set of pairs that say this node has an edge connecting it tothis other node
 so that's the that's an a graph is just a collection of those pairs that saythis node connects to this other node so
 this is a generalization of that in which instead of having pairs you havearbitrary and tuples um that's it that's
 the whole story um and now the question is okay so that might be that mightrepresent the state of the universe how
 does the universe evolved what does the end of us do and so the answer is thatwhat I'm looking at is transformation
 rules on these hyper graphs in other words you say this whenever you see a apiece of this hyper graph that looks
 like this turn it into a piece of hyper graph that looks like this so on a graphit might be when you see the sub graph
 when you see this thing with a bunch of edges hanging out in this particular waythen rewrite it as this other graph
 mm-hm okay and so that's the whole story sothe question is what so now you say I
 mean think as I say this is quite abstract and one of the questions iswhere do you do those updating so you've
 got this giant graph what triggers

1:05:31
Speaker 0 :outdating like what's the what's the
 ripple effect of it is it yeah and I I suspecteverything's discrete even in time so


1:05:41
Speaker 1 :okay so the question is where do you do
 the updates yes and the answer is the rule is you do them wherever they applyand you do them you do them the order in
 which the updates is done is not defined that is the you can do them so there maybe many possible orderings for these
 updates now the point is if imagine you're an observer in this universe soand you say did something get updated
 well you don't in any sense know until you yourself have been updated right soin fact all that you can be sensitive to
 is essentially the causal network of how an event over there affects an eventthat's in you it doesn't even feel like


1:06:22
Speaker 0 :observation that's like that's something
 else you're just part of the whole thing

1:06:27
Speaker 1 :yes you're part of it but but even to
 have so the the end result of that is you're sensitive to is this causalnetwork of what event effects what other
 event I'm not making a big statement about sort of the structure of theobserver I'm simply saying I'm simply
 making the argument that what happens the microscopic order of these rewritesis not something that any observer any
 conceivable observer in this universe can be affected by because the the onlything the observer can be affected by is
 this causal network of how the events in the observer are affected by otherevents that happen in the universe so
 the only thing you have to look at is the causal network you don't really haveto look at this microscopic rewriting
 that's happening so these rewrites are happening wherever they they were theyhappen wherever they feel like causal


1:07:18
Speaker 0 :network is there you said that there's


1:07:22
Speaker 1 :

1:07:22
Speaker 0 :not really so the idea would be an
 undefined like what gets updated the the sequence of things is undefined it's a

1:07:31
Speaker 1 :

1:07:32
Speaker 0 :yes that's what you mean by the causal
 network then the cop no the causal

1:07:35
Speaker 1 :network is given that an update has
 happened that's an event then the question is is that event causallyrelated to does that event if that event
 didn't happen then some future event couldn't happen yet gotchaand so you build up this network of what
 effects what okay and so what that does so when you build up that network that'skind of the observable aspect of the
 universe in some sense yeah um and so then you can ask questionsabout you know how robust is that
 observable ass network of the what's happening in the universe okay so here'swhere it starts getting kind of
 interesting so for certain kinds of microscopic rewriting rules the order ofrewrites does not matter to the causal
 network and so this is okay mathematical logic moment this is equivalent to thechurch-rosser property of a confluence
 property of rewrite rules and it's the same reason that if you are simplifyingan algebraic expression for example you
 can say oh let me expand those terms out let me factor those pieces doesn'tmatter what order you do that in you'll
 always get the same answer and that's it's the same fundamental phenomenonthat causes for certain kinds of
 microscopic rewrite that causes the causal network to beindependent of the microscopic order of
 rewritings why is there properly

1:08:53
Speaker 0 :

1:08:55
Speaker 1 :important because it implies special
 relativity I mean the reason what the reason it's important is that thatproperty special relativity says you can
 look at these sort of you can look at different reference frames you can havedifferent you can be looking at your
 notion of what space and what's time can be different depending on whether you'retraveling at a certain speed depending
 on whether you're doing this that and the other but nevertheless the laws ofphysics are the same that's what the
 principle special relativity says there's the laws of physics are the sameindependent of your reference frame well
 turns out this sort of change of the microscopic rewriting order isessentially equivalent to a change of
 reference frame or at least there's a sub part of how that works that's a callinterchange a reference frame so
 somewhat surprisingly and sort of for the first time and forever it's possiblefor an underlying microscopic theory to
 imply special relativity to be able to derive it it's not something you put inas a this is a it's something where this
 other property causal invariance which is also the property that implies thatthere's a single thread of time in the
 universe it might not be the case that that's that is the that's what wouldlead to the possibility of an observer
 thinking that definite stuff happens otherwise you've got all these possiblerewriting orders and who's to say which
 one occurred but with this causal invariance property there's a there's anotion of a definite threat of time it


1:10:25
Speaker 0 :sounds like that kind of idea of time
 even space would be emergent from the system oh yeah no it's not a fundamental

1:10:33
Speaker 1 :part of the fundamental level all you've
 got is a bunch of nodes connected by hyper edges or whatever so there's no

1:10:38
Speaker 0 :time there's not space that's right and


1:10:40
Speaker 1 :but but the the thing is that it's just
 like imagining imagine you're just dealing with a graph and imagine youhave something like a you know like a
 honeycomb graph we have a hexagon bunch a hexagonyou know that graph at a microscopic
 level is just a bunch of nodes connected to other nodes but at a microscopiclevel you say that looks like a
 honeycomb you know it's lattice it looks like atwo-dimensional you know manifold of
 some kind it looks like a two-dimensional thing if you connect itdifferently if you just connect all the
 nodes one one to another and kind of a sort of linked list type structure thenyou'd say well that looks like a
 one-dimensional space but at the microscopic level all these are justnetworks with nodes the macroscopic
 level they look like something that's like one of our sort of familiar kindsof space and it's the same thing with
 these hyper graphs now if you ask me have I found one that gives me threedimensional space the answer is not yet
 so we don't know this is one of these things we're kind of betting againstnature so to speak and I have no way to
 know I mean so there are many other properties of this this kind of systemthat have are very beautiful actually
 and very suggestive and it will be very elegant if this turns out to be rightbecause it's very it's very clean and
 you start with nothing and everything gets built up everything about spaceeverything about time everything about
 matter it's all just emergent from the properties of this extremely low-levelsystem and that that will be pretty cool
 if that's the way our universe works now do I on the other hand the thingthat that I find very confusing is let's
 say we succeed let's say we can say this particular sort of hyper graph rewritingrule gives the universe just run that
 hyper graph rewriting rule for enough times and you'll get everything you'llget this conversation we're having will
 you'll get everything it's that um if we get to that point and we look at what isthis thing what is this rule that we
 just have that is giving us our whole universe how do we think about thatthing let's say turns out the minimal
 version of this and this is kind of cool thing for a language designer like methe the minimal version of this model is
 actually a single line of orphan language code so that's I wasn't sure isgoing to happen that way but it's it's a
 that's um it's kind of now we don't know what we don't know what that's that'sjust the framework to know the actual
 particular hypergraph that might be a longer that the specification of therules might be slightly like how does


1:13:14
Speaker 0 :help you except marveling in the beauty
 and the elegance of the simplicity that creates the universe that does that helpus predict anything not really because
 of the irreducibility that's correct

1:13:25
Speaker 1 :that's correct but so the thing that is
 really strange to me and I haven't wrapped my my brain around this yet isyou know one is one keeps on realizing
 that we're not special in the sense that you know we don't live at the center ofthe universe we don't blah blah blah and
 yet if we produce a rule for the universe and it's quite simple and wecan write it down and a couple of lines
 or something that feels very special how do we come to get a simple universe whenmany of the available universes so to
 speak are incredibly complicated might be you know a quintillion characterslong why did we get one of the ones
 that's simple and so I haven't wrapped my brain around that asou yet if indeed

1:14:11
Speaker 0 :we are in such a simple way the universe
 is such a simple rule is it possible that there is something outside of thisthat we are in a kind of what people
 calls to the simulation right the word just part of a computation is beingexplored by a graduate student in
 alternate universe well you know the

1:14:31
Speaker 1 :problem is we don't get to say much
 about what's outside our universe because by definition our universe iswhat we exist within yeah now can we
 make a sort of almost theological conclusion from being able to know howour particular universe works
 interesting question I don't think that if you ask the question could we and itrelates again to this question about the
 extraterrestrial intelligence you know we've got the rule for the universe wasit built in on purpose hard to say
 that's the same thing as saying we see a signal from you know that we're you knowreceiving from some you know random star
 somewhere and it's a series of pulses and you know it's a periodic series ofpulses let's say was that done on
 purpose can we conclude something about the origin of that series of pulses just

1:15:21
Speaker 0 :because it's elegant does not
 necessarily mean that somebody created it or thoughcan even comprehend yeah well yeah I


1:15:29
Speaker 1 :think it's it's the ultimate version of
 the sort of identification of the techno signature questionit's the ultimate version of that is was
 our universe a piece of technology so to speak and how on earth would we knowbecause but I mean it'll be it's some I
 mean you know in the kind of crazy science fiction thing you could imagineyou could say Oh somebody's going to
 have them you know that's gonna be a signature there it's gonna be you knowmade by so-and-so but there's no way we
 could understand that sort of speaking it's not clear what that would meanbecause the universe simply you know
 this if we find a rule for the universe we're not we're simply saying that rulerepresents what our universe does we're
 not saying that that rule is something running on a big computer and making ouruniverse it's just saying that
 represents what our universe does in the same sense that you know laws ofclassical mechanics differential
 equations whatever they are represent what mechanical systems do it's not thatthe mechanical systems are somehow
 running solutions to those differential equations those differential equationsjust representing the behavior of those


1:16:39
Speaker 0 :systems so what's the gap in your sense
 to linger and the fascinating perhaps slightly sci-fi a question what's thegap between understanding the
 fundamental rules that create a universe and engineering a system actuallycreating a simulation ourselves so
 you've talked about sort of you've talked about you know nano engineeringkind of ideas that are kind of exciting
 actually creating some ideas of computation in the physical space howhard it is is it as an engineering
 problem to create the universe once you know the rules the Creator and well it's

1:17:12
Speaker 1 :an interesting question I think the
 substrate on which the universe is operating is not a substrate that wehave access to I mean the only substrate
 we have is that same substrate that the universe is operating in so if theuniverse is a bunch of hypergraphs being
 rewritten then we get to attach ourselves to those same hypergraphsbeing rewritten we don't get to and if
 you ask the question you know is the code clean you know is you know can wewrite nice elegant code
 with efficient algorithms and so on well that's an interesting question how howyou know that's this question of how
 much computational reducibility there is in the system but so I've seen some

1:17:52
Speaker 0 :beautiful cellular automata that
 basically create copies of itself within itself right that's the question whetherit's possible to create like whether you
 need to understand the substrate or whether you can just yeah well right I

1:18:04
Speaker 1 :mean so one of the things that is sort
 of one of my slightly sci-fi thoughts about the future so to speak is you knowright now if you pol typical people who
 say do you think it's important to find the fundamental theory of physics youget because I've done this poll
 informally at least it's curious actually you get a decent fraction ofpeople saying oh yeah that would be
 pretty interesting I think that's

1:18:27
Speaker 0 :becoming surprisingly enough more I mean
 a lot of people are interested in physics in a way that like withoutunderstanding it just kind of watching
 scientists a very small number of them struggle to understand the nature of our

1:18:46
Speaker 1 :reality right mean I I mean I I think
 that's somewhat true and in fact in this project that I'm launching into to tryand find in fundamental theory of
 physics I'm going to do it as a very public project I mean it's gonna be livestreamed and all this kind of stuff and
 I don't know what will happen it'll be kind of fun I mean I think that it's theinterface to the world of this project I
 mean I I figure one feature of this project is you know unlike technologyprojects that basically are what they
 are this is a project that might simply fail because it might be the case thatgenerates all kinds of elegant
 mathematics that has absolutely nothing to do with the physical universe that wehappen to live in well okay so we're
 talking about kind of the quest to find the fundamental theory physics firstpoint is you know it's turned out it's
 kind of hard to find the fundamental theory physics people weren't sure thatthat would be the case back in the early
 days of applying mathematics to science 1600s and so on people were like oh anda hundred years we'll know everything
 there is to know about how the universe works turned out to be harder than thatand people got kind of humble at some
 level because every time we got to a sort of a greater level of smallness anduniverse it seemed like the math got
 more complicated and everything got got harder the you know when I when I was akid basically I started doing particle
 physics and you know what I was doing particle physicsI always thought finding the fundamental
 fundamental theory of physics that's a kooky business we'll never be able to dothat um but we can operate within these
 frameworks that we built for doing quantum field theory and generalrelativity and things like this and it's
 all good and we can figure out a lot of

1:20:26
Speaker 0 :stuff did you even at that time have a
 sense that there's something behind that

1:20:30
Speaker 1 :sure I just didn't expect that I thought
 in some rather on it's actually kind of crazy and thinking back on it becauseit's kind of like there was this long
 period in civilization where people thought the ancients had it all figuredout and we'll never figure out oh
 nothing new and to some extent that's the way I felt about physics when I wasin the middle of doing it so to speak
 and was you know we've got quantum field theory it's the foundation of what we'redoing and there's you know yes there's
 probably something underneath this but we'll sort of never figure it out butthen I started studying simple programs
 and the computational universe things like solar automata and so on and Idiscovered that there so they do all
 kinds of things that were completely at odds with the intuition that I had hadand so after that after you see this
 tiny little program that does all this amazingly complicated stuff then youstart feeling a bit more ambitious about
 physics and saying maybe we could do this for physics too and so that's somethat got me started years ago now and
 this kind of idea of could we actually find what's underneath all of theseframeworks like one a field theory in
 jorts everything's on and people perhaps don't realize as slow as they might thatyou know the frameworks we're using for
 physics which is basically these two things quantum field theory the sort ofthe theory of small stuff and general
 relativity theory of gravitation and large stuff those are the two basictheories and they're 100 years old I
 mean general relativity was 1915 quantum field theory well 1920s I'm basically ahundred years old
 and they've they've it's been a good run there's a lot of stuff been figured outbut what's interesting is the
 foundations haven't changed in all that period of time even though thefoundations had changed several times
 before that in the two hundred years earlier than that um and I think thekinds of things that I'm thinking about
 which is sort of really informed by thinking about computation in thecomputational universe it's a different
 foundation it's a different set of foundations and might be wrong but it isat least you know we have a shot and I
 think it's you know to me it's you know my personal calculation for myself is isyou know if it turns out that the
 finding the fundamental theory of physics it's kind of low-hanging fruitso to speak
 it'd be a shame if we just didn't think to do it you know if people just said ohyou'll never figure that stuff out let's
 you know and it takes another two hundred years before anybody gets aroundto doing it um you know I think it's I
 don't know how low-hanging this fruit actually is it may be you know it may bethat it's kind of the wrong century to
 do this project I mean I think the the the cautionary tale for me you know Ithink about things that I've tried to do
 in technology where people thought about doing them a lot earlier and my favoriteexample is probably live Nets who-who
 thought about making essentially encapsulating the world's knowledge in acomputational form in the late 1600s and
 did a lot of things towards that and basically you know we finally managed todo this but he was three hundred years
 too early and that's the that's kind of the in terms of life planning it's kindof like avoid things that can't be done
 in your in your century so to speak yeah

1:23:51
Speaker 0 :timing timing is everything you so you
 think if we kind of figure out the underlying rules that can create fromwhich quantum field theory in general
 relativity can emerge do you think they'll help us unify it at that level

1:24:08
Speaker 1 :of track we'll know it completely we'll
 know how that all fits together yes without a question and I mean it'salready even the things I've already
 done they're a very you know it's very very elegant actualhow things seem to be fitting together
 now you know is it right I don't know yet it's awfully suggestive if it isn'tright it's some then the designer of the
 universe should feel embarrassed so to speak because it's a really good way to

1:24:37
Speaker 0 :do that in your intuition in terms of
 design universe does God play dice is there is there randomness in this thingor is it deterministic so the kind of


1:24:47
Speaker 1 :guy that's a little bit of a complicated
 question because when you're dealing with these things that involve theserewrites that have okay even randomness


1:24:54
Speaker 0 :is an emergent phenomenon perhaps yes I


1:24:56
Speaker 1 :mean it's a yeah well randomness in in
 many of these systems pseudo randomness and randomness are hard to distinguishum in this particular case the current
 idea that we have about some measurement in quantum mechanics is something verybizarre and very abstract and I don't
 think I can yet explain it without kind of yakking about very technical thingseventually I will be able to but if
 that's if that's right it's kind of a it's a weird thing because it slicesbetween determinism and randomness in a
 weird way that hasn't been sliced before so to speak so like many of thesequestions that come up in science where
 it's like is that this or is it that turns out the real answer is it'sneither of those things it's something
 kind of different and sort of orthogonal to those those those categories and sothat's the current you know this week's
 idea about how that might work um but you know we'll we'll see how that termunfolds I mean there's there's this
 question about a field like physics and sort of the quest for a fundamentaltheory and so on and there's both the
 science of what happens and there's the the sort of the social aspect of whathappens because you know in a field that
 is basically as old as physics we're at I don't know what it is fourthgeneration I don't know fourth
 generation I don't know what generation it is of physicists and like I was oneof these so to speak and for me the
 foundations were like the pyramids so to speak you know it was that way and itwas always that way
 um it is difficult in an old field to go back to the foundations and would thinkabout rewriting them it's a lot easier
 in young fields where you're still dealing with the first generation ofpeople who invented the field and it
 tends to be the case you know that the nature of what happens in science tendsto be you know you'll get there
 typically the pattern is some methodological advanced occurs and thenthere's a period of five years ten years
 maybe a little bit longer than that where there's lots of things that arenow made possible whether by that
 methodological advance whether it's you know I don't know telescopes or whetherthat's some mathematical method or
 something it's you know there's a something something happens a tool getsbuilt and then you can do a bunch of
 stuff and there's bunch of low-hanging fruit to be picked and that takes acertain amount of time after that all
 that low-hanging fruit is picked then it's a hard slog for the next howevermany decades or century or more to get
 to the next sort of level at which one can do something and it's kind of a a.m.and it tends to be the case that in
 fields that are in that kind of but I wouldn't say cruise mode because it'sreally hard work but it's very hard work
 for very incremental progress

1:27:48
Speaker 0 :um and the in your career and some of
 the things you've taken on it feels like you're not you haven't been afraid of

1:27:54
Speaker 1 :the hard slog the also true so it's


1:27:55
Speaker 0 :quite interesting especially on the
 engineering on the engineering side and a small tangent when you were a Caltechdid you get to interact with Richard
 five-minute ology aviemore he's very

1:28:10
Speaker 1 :sure we we work together quite a bit
 actually in fact on and in fact both when I wasat Caltech and after I left Caltech
 we were both consultants at this company called Thinking Machines Corporationwhich was just down the street from here
 actually um ultimately ill-fated company but um I used to say this company is notgoing to work with the strategy they
 have and dick Feynman always used to say what do we know about running companiesjust let them run their company but uh
 anyway I was there he was not into into that kind of thing and he always thoughtit was thought that my interest in doing
 things like running companies was a was a distraction so to speak um andfor me it's a it's a mechanism to have a
 more effective machine for actually getting things figuring things out andgetting things to happen did he think of


1:28:59
Speaker 0 :it because essentially what you used you


1:29:02
Speaker 1 :

1:29:02
Speaker 0 :did with the company I don't know if you
 were thinking of it that way but you're creating tools to empower your toempower the exploration of the
 university do you think did he did he

1:29:14
Speaker 1 :understand that point that the point of


1:29:16
Speaker 0 :

1:29:18
Speaker 1 :tools of I think not as well as he might
 have done I mean I think that but you know he was actually my first companywhich was also involved with well was
 involved with more mathematical computation kinds of things um you knowhe was quite - he had lots of advice
 about the technical side of what we should do and so on um giving examples

1:29:39
Speaker 0 :and memories of thoughts that oh yeah


1:29:41
Speaker 1 :yeah he had all kinds of lucky in in the
 business of doing sort of you know one of the hard things in math is doingintegrals and so on right and so he had
 his own elaborate ways to do integrals and so on he had his own ways ofthinking about sort of getting intuition
 about how math works and so his sort of meta idea was take those intuitionalmethods and make a computer follow those
 in traditional methods now it turns out for the most part like when we dointegrals and things what we do is is we
 build this kind of bizarre industrial machine that turns every integral untilyou know products of Mayer G functions
 and generates this very elaborate thing and actually the big problem is turningthe results into something a human will
 understand it's not quotes doing the integral and actually Fineman didunderstand that to some extent and I I
 am embarrassed to say he once gave me this big pile of you know calculationalmethods for particle physics that he
 worked out in the 50s and he said you know it's more used to you than to metype thing and I I was like I were
 intended to look at it and give it back and I store my files now so it's butthat's what happens when when it's
 finiteness of human lives it um I hate you know maybe if he'd live another 20years I would have I would remember to
 give it back but I think it's you know that that was his attempt to systematizethe ways that one does integrals that
 show up in particle physics and so on turns out the way we've actually done itis very different from that way what do


1:31:09
Speaker 0 :you make of that difference between so
 fireman was actually quite remarkable at creating sort of intuitive like divingin you know creating intuitive
 frameworks for understanding difficult

1:31:22
Speaker 1 :concepts is I'm smiling because you know
 the funny thing about him was that the thing he was really really really goodat is calculating stuff and but he
 thought that was easy because he was really good at it and so he would dothese things where he would calculate
 some do some complicated calculation in quantum field theory for example comeout with a result wouldn't tell
 everybody about the complicated calculation because thought that waseasy
 he thought the really impressive thing was to have this simple intuition abouthow everything worse so he invented that
 at the end and you know because he'd done this calculation and knew what howit worked it was a lot easier it's a lot
 easier to have good intuition when you know what the answer is and then andthen he would just not tell anybody
 about these calculations he wasn't meaning that maliciously so to speak isjust he thought that was easy
 yeah um and and that's you know that led to areas where people were justcompletely mystified and they kind of
 followed his intuition but nobody could tell why it worked because actually thereason it worked was because he done all
 these calculations and he knew that it was would work and you know when I peeand I worked a bit on quantum computers
 actually back in 1980-81 but before anybody had heard of those things andyou know the typical mode of um I mean
 he always used to say and I now think about this because I'm about the agethat he was when I worked with him and
 you know I see that people have 1/3 my age so to speak and oh he was alwayscomplaining that I was one-third his age
 and so for various things but but you know he would do some calculation by byhand you know blackboard and things come
 up with some answer I'd say I don't understand this you know I do somethingwith a computer and he'd say you know I
 don't understand this so it'd be some big argument about what was you knowwhat was going on but that it was always
 some and I think actually we many of thethings that we sort of realized about
 quantum computing that were sort of issues that have to do particularly withthe measurement process are kind of
 still issues today and I kind of find it interesting it's a funny thing inscience that these you know that there's
 there's a remarkable happens in technology too there's a remarkable sortof repetition of history that ends up
 occurring eventually things really get nailed down but it often takes a whileand it often things come back decades
 later well for example I could tell a story actually happened right down thestreet from here um I will move both
 that thinking machines I had been working on this particular cellularautomaton will rule 30 that has this
 feature that it from very simple initial conditions it makes really complicatedbehavior okay
 so and actually of all silly physical things using this big parallel computercalled a connection machine that that
 company was making I generated this giant printout of rule 30 on very I'mactually on the same kind of same kind
 of printer that people use to make um layouts for microprocessors so one ofthese big you know large format printers
 with high resolution and so on so okay so print this out lots of very tinycells and so there was sort of a
 question of how some features of that pattern and so it was very much aphysical you know on the floor with
 meter rules trying to measure different things so so Feynman kind of takes measide we've been doing that for a little
 while and takes me aside he says I just want to know this one thing he says Iwant to know how did you know that this
 rule 30 thing would produce all this really complicated behavior that is socomplicated that weird you know going
 around this big printout and so on and I said well I didn't know I justenumerated all the possible rules and
 then observed that that's what happened he said ah I feel a lot better you knowI thought you had some intuition that he
 didn't have that would let why I said no no no intuition just experimentalscience so that's


1:35:27
Speaker 0 :such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there
 of that's exactly showed is you really can't have an intuition about anirreducible I mean you have to run us
 yes that's right that's so hard for us humans andespecially brilliant physicist like
 fireman to say that you can't haven't compressed clean intuition about how thewhole thing yes works yes no he was I


1:35:52
Speaker 1 :mean I think he was sort of on the edge
 of understanding that point about computation and I think he found that Ithink he always found computation
 interesting and I think that was sort of what he was a little bit poking at Imean yeah that intuition you know the
 difficulty of discovering things like even you say oh you know you just didn'twrite all the cases in just find one
 that does something interesting right sounds very easy turns out like I missedit when I first saw it because I had
 kind of an intuition that said it shouldn't be there and so I had kind ofarguments oh I'm gonna ignore that case
 because whatever um and so how did you

1:36:29
Speaker 0 :have an open mind enough because you're
 essentially the same person is just your fight like for the same kind of physicstype of thinking how did you find
 yourself having a sufficiently open mind to be open to watching rules and themrevealing complexity yeah I think that's


1:36:44
Speaker 1 :an interesting question I've wondered
 about that myself because it's kind of like you know you live through thesethings and then you say what was the
 historical story and sometimes the historical story that you realized afterthe fact was not what you lived through
 so to speak and so you know what I realized is I think what happened is youknow I did physics kind of like
 reductionistic physics where you're throw-in the universe and you have tellsgo figure out what's going on inside it
 and then I started building computer tools and I started building my firstcomputer language for example and
 computer language is not like it's sort of like physics in the sense that youhave to take all those computations
 people want to do and kind of drill down and find the primitives that they canall be made of but then you do something
 that's really different because you just you're just saying okay these are theprimitives now you know hopefully
 they'll be useful to people let's build up from there so you're essentiallybuilding an
 show universe in a sense where you make this language you've got theseprimitives you're just building whatever
 you feel like building and that's and so it was sort of interesting for mebecause from doing science where you
 just throw in the universe as the universe is to then just being told youknow you can make up any universe you
 want and so I think that experience of of making a computer language which isessentially building your own universe
 so to speak is you know that's kind of the that's that's what gave me asomewhat different attitude towards what
 might be possible it's like let's just explore what can be done in theseartificial universes rather than
 thinking the natural science way of let's be constrained by how the universeactually is yeah by being able to


1:38:25
Speaker 0 :program essentially you've as opposed to
 being limited to just your mind and a pen you you now have you've basicallybuilt another brain that you can use to
 explore the universe but yeah computer program you know this is kind of a brain

1:38:41
Speaker 1 :right and it's well it's it's or
 telescope or you know it's a tool and it lets you see stuff but there's something

1:38:46
Speaker 0 :fundamentally different between a
 computer and a telescope I mean it just yeah I'm Amanda sighs the notion but

1:38:56
Speaker 1 :it's more general and it's it's I think
 I mean this point about you know people say oh such and such a thing was almostdiscovered at such and such a time the
 the distance between you know the building the paradigm that allows you toactually understand stuff or allows one
 to be open to seeing what's going on that's really hard and you know I thinkin I've been fortunate in my life that I
 spent a lot of my time building computational language and that's anactivity that in a sense works by sort
 of having to kind of create another level of abstraction and kind of be opento different kinds of structures but you
 know it's it's always some I mean I'm fully aware of I suppose the fact that Ihave seen it a bunch of times of how
 easy it is to miss the obvious so to speak that at least is factored into myattempt to not miss the obvious
 although it may not succeed what do you

1:39:58
Speaker 0 :think is the role of ego in the history
 of math and science and more sort of you know a book title is something like anew kind of science you've accomplished
 a huge amount in fact somebody said that Newton didn't have an ego and I lookedinto it and he had a huge ego yeah but
 from an outsider's perspective some have said that you have a bit of an ego as

1:40:25
Speaker 1 :well do you see it that way does ego get


1:40:27
Speaker 0 :in the way is it empowering is it both


1:40:32
Speaker 1 :so it's it's it's all implicated
 necessary I mean you know I've had look I've spent more than half my life CEO ina tech company right ok
 and you know that is a I think it's actually very it means that one's ego isnot a distant thing it's the thing that
 one encounters every day so to speak because it's it's all tied up withleadership and with how one you know
 develops an organization and all these kinds of things so you know it may bethat if I've been an academic for
 example I could have sort of you know check the ego put it on put on a shelfsomewhere and ignored its
 characteristics but for your reminder it

1:41:10
Speaker 0 :quite often in the context of running a


1:41:13
Speaker 1 :company sure yeah I mean that's what
 it's about it's it's about leadership and you know leadership is intimatelytied to ego now what does it mean I mean
 what what is the you know for me I've been fortunate that I think I havereasonable intellectual confidence so to
 speak that is you know I I'm one of these people who at this point ifsomebody tells me something and I just
 don't understand it my conclusion isn't that means I'm dumb that my conclusionis there's something wrong with what I'm
 being told and that was actually dick Feynman used to have that that thatfeature - he never really believed it he
 actually believed in experts much less than I believe in experts so Wow so

1:41:57
Speaker 0 :that's a fun that's a that's a
 fundamentally powerful property of ego and saying like not that I am wrongbut that the the world is wrong and
 telling me like when confronted with the fact that doesn't fit the thing thatyou've really thought through sort of
 both the negative and the positive of

1:42:19
Speaker 1 :ego you see the negative of that get in


1:42:20
Speaker 0 :the way sort of be sure the Fronteras


1:42:24
Speaker 1 :mistakes I've made that are the results
 of I'm pretty sure I'm right and turns out I'm not I mean that's that's the youknow but but the thing is that the the
 the idea that one tries to do things that so for example you know onequestion is if people have tried hard to
 do something and then one thinks maybe I should try doing this myselfif one does not have a certain degree of
 intellectual confidence one just says well people have been trying to do thisfor a hundred years how am I going to be
 able to do this yeah and you know I was fortunate in the sense that I happen tostart having some degree of success in
 science and things when I was really young and so that developed a certainamounts of sort of intellectual
 confidence I don't think I otherwise would have had um and you know in asense I mean I was fortunate that I was
 working in the field particle physics during it sort of Golden Age of rapidprogress and that that's kind of good on
 a false sense of achievement because it's kind of kind of easy to discoverstuff that's gonna survive if you happen
 to be you know picking the low-hanging fruit of a rapidly expanding field I

1:43:30
Speaker 0 :mean the reason I totally I totally
 immediately understood the ego behind a new kind of science to me let me sort ofjust try to express my feelings and the
 whole thing is that if you don't allow that kind of ego then you would neverwrite that book that you would say well
 people must have done this there's not you would not dig you would not keepdigging and I think that was I think you
 have to take that ego and ride it and see where it takes you in that andthat's how you create exceptional work I


1:44:03
Speaker 1 :think the other point about that book
 was it was a non-trivial question how to take a bunch of ideas that uhI think reasonably big ideas they might
 you know their importance is determined by what happens historically one can'ttell how important they are one can tell
 sort of the scope of them and the scope is fairly big and they'revery different from things that have
 come before and the question is how do you explain that stuff to people and soI had had the experience of sort of
 saying well there these things does a cellular automaton it does this it doesthat and people are like oh it must be
 just like this it must be just like that say no it isn't it's something differentright I said I could have done sort of


1:44:43
Speaker 0 :I'm really glad you did what you did but
 you could have done a sort of academically just publish keeppublishing small papers here and there
 and then you would just keep getting this kind of resistance right you wouldget like yeah it's supposed to just
 dropping a thing that says here it is yeah here's like full the full thing no

1:44:59
Speaker 1 :I mean that was my calculation is that
 basically you know you could introduce little pieces it's like you know onepossibility is like it's it's the secret
 weapon so to speak it's this you know I keep on an intraday you know discoveringthese things in all these different
 areas where'd they come from nobody knows but I decided that you knowin the interests of one only has one
 life to lead and you know it the writing that book took me a decade anyway it'snot there's not a lot of wiggle room so
 to speak one can't be wrong by a factor of three he said is peeking how longit's going to take that I you know I
 thought the best thing to do the thing that is most sort of that most respectsthe the intellectual content so to speak
 is you just put it out with as much force as you can because it's notsomething where and you know it's an
 interesting thing you talk about ego and it's it's you know for example I run acompany which has my name on it right I
 I thought about starting a club people whose companies have their names on themand it's it's a funny group because
 we're not a bunch of ego maniacs that's not what it's about so to speak it'sabout basically sort of taking
 responsibility for what one's doing and you know in a sense any of these thingswhere you're sort of putting yourself on
 the line it's it's kind of a funny it's a funny dynamic because in a sense mycompany is sort of something that
 happens to have my name on it but it's kind of bigger than me and I'm kind ofjust its mascot at some level I mean I
 also happen to be a pretty you know strong leader of it but but

1:46:37
Speaker 0 :it's basically showing a deep
 inextricable sort of investment the same your name like Steve Jobs his namewasn't on Apple but he was Apple yes
 Elon Musk's name is not on Tesla but he is Tesla so it's like a meaningemotionally his company succeeds or
 fails he would just that emotionally would suffer through that and so that's

1:47:07
Speaker 1 :that's did recognizing that fact tonight
 and also wolf form is a pretty good

1:47:10
Speaker 0 :branding name so that works up I think


1:47:13
Speaker 1 :Steve had it had a bad deal there yeah


1:47:17
Speaker 0 :so you you've made up for it with the
 last name okay so so in 2002 you published a new kind of science to whichsort of on a personal level I can credit
 my love for cellular automata and computation in general I think a lot ofothers can as well can you briefly
 describe the vision the hope the main idea presented in this twelve hundred

1:47:46
Speaker 1 :page book sure although it took twelve
 hundred pages to say in the book so know that the the real idea it's kind of agood way to get into it is to look at
 sort of the arc of history and to look at what's happened in kind of thedevelopments of science I mean there was
 this sort of big idea in science about three hundred years ago that was let'suse mathematical equations to try and
 describe things in the world let's use sort of the formal idea of mathematicalequations to describe what might be
 happening in the world rather than for example just using sort of logicalaugmentation and so on let's have a a
 formal theory about that and so they've been this three hundred year run ofusing mathematical equations to describe
 the natural world which would work pretty well but I got interested in howone could generalize that notion you
 know there is a formal theory there are definite rules but what structure couldthose rules have and so what I got
 interested in was let's generalize beyond the sort of purely mathematicalrules and we now have this sort of
 ocean of programming and computing and so on let's use the kinds of rules thatcan be embodied in programs to has a
 sort of generalization of the ones that can exist in mathematics as a way todescribe the world and so my kind of
 favorite version of these kinds of simple rules are these things calledcellular automata and so typical case


1:49:11
Speaker 0 :shall we what are cellular automata fair


1:49:14
Speaker 1 :enough so typical case of a cellular
 automaton it's an array of cells it's just a line of discrete cells each cellis either black or white and in a series
 of steps you can represent as lines going down a page you're updating thecolor of each cell according to a rule
 that depends on the color of the cell above it and to its left and right soit's really simple so a thing might be
 you know if the cell on its right neighbor are not the same and or thecell on the left is is is black or
 something then make it back on the next step and if not make it white typicalrule um that rule I'm not sure I said it
 exactly right but a rule very much like what I just said has the feature that ifyou started off from just one black cell
 at the top it makes this extremely complicated pattern so some rules youget a very simple pattern some rules you
 have the rule is simple you start them off from a sort of simple seed you justget this very simple pattern but other
 rules and this was the big surprise when I started actually just doing the simplecomputer experiments to find out what
 happens is that they produce very complicated patterns of behavior so forexample its rule 30 rule has the feature
 you start from just one black cell at the top makes this very random patternif you look like at the center column of
 cells you get a series of values you know it goes back white black blackwhatever it is that sequence seems for
 all practical purposes random so it's kind of like in in math you know you canput the digits of pi 3
 one four one five nine two six whatever those digits once computed I mean thatthe scheme for computing pi you know
 it's the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle verywell-defined but yet when you are once
 you've generated those digits they seem for all practical purposes completelyrandom and so it is with rule 30 that
 even though the rule is very simple much simpler much more sort ofcomputationally obvious than the rule
 for generating digits of pi even with a rule that simple you're still generatingimmensely complicated behavior yeah so


1:51:35
Speaker 0 :if we could just pause on that I think
 you you probably said it and looked at it so long you forgot the magic of it orperhaps you know you still feel the
 magic but to me if you've never seen sort of I would say what is it a onedimensional essentially another automata
 right and and you were to guess what you would see if you have some so cells thatonly respond to its neighbors right if


1:52:03
Speaker 1 :

1:52:05
Speaker 0 :you were to guess what kind of things
 you would see like my my initial guess like even when I first like open yourbook a new kind of science right - your
 guess is you would see I mean it would be a very simple stuff like and I thinkit's a magical experience to realize the
 kind of complex you mentioned rule 30 still your favorite cellular automaton

1:52:29
Speaker 1 :oh my favorite rule yes it you get


1:52:31
Speaker 0 :complexity immense complexity you get
 arbitrary complexity yes and when you say randomness down the middle columnyou know that's just what one cool way
 to say that there's incredible complexity and that's just the gist Imean that's a magical idea however you
 start to interpret it all the reducibility discussions all that butit's just I think that has profound
 philosophical kind of notions around it - it's not just well you know I meanthis transformation about how you see
 the world I think for me was transformational I don't know we canwhat it can have all kinds of discussion
 about computation and so on but just you know Iand sometimes think if I were on a
 desert island and was I don't know maybe it was some psychedelics or somethingbut if I had to take one book any new
 kind of science would be a because you just enjoy that notion for some reasonit's a deeply profound notion at least


1:53:32
Speaker 1 :to me I find it that way yeah I mean
 look it's been it was a very intuition breaking thing to discover I mean it'skind of like you know you you point the
 computational telescope out there and suddenly you see I don't know you knowin the past it's kind of like you know
 moons of Jupiter or something but suddenly you see something that's kindof very unexpected and rule 30 was very
 unexpected for me and the big challenge at a personal level was to not ignore itI mean people you know in other words
 you might say you know it's a bug what

1:54:05
Speaker 0 :would you say yeah well yeah I mean I I


1:54:07
Speaker 1 :what are we looking at by the way well I
 was just generating Herald actually generated a rule 30 pattern so that'sthe rule for for rule 30 and it says for
 example it says here if you have a black cell in the middle and black cell to theleft and white cell to the right then
 the cell on the next step will be white and so here's the actual pattern thatyou get starting off from a single black
 cell at the top there and then that's

1:54:33
Speaker 0 :the initial state initial condition


1:54:35
Speaker 1 :that's the initial thing you just start
 off from that and then you're going down the page and at every at every stepyou're just applying this rule to find
 out the new value that you get and so you might think rule that simple you gotto get that there's got to be some trace
 of that simplicity here okay we'll run it let's say for 400 steps um what itdoes it's kind of really asking a bit on
 the screen there but but um you can see there's a little bit of regularity overon the left but there's a lot of stuff
 here that just looks very complicated very random and that's a big sort ofshock to was a big shock to my intuition
 at least that that's possible your mind

1:55:16
Speaker 0 :immediately starts is there a pattern
 there must be a repetitive pattern yeah

1:55:20
Speaker 1 :there must be as well the rhein so I
 spent so indeed that's what I thought at first and I thought I thought well thisis kind of interesting but you know if
 we long enough we'll see you know somethingwill resolve into something simple and
 you know I did all kinds of analysis of using mathematics statisticscryptography whatever whatever to try
 and crack it and I never succeeded and after I hadn't succeeded for awhile Istarted thinking maybe there's a real
 phenomenon here that is the reason I'm not succeeding maybe I mean the thingthat for me was sort of a motivating
 factor was looking at the natural world and seeing all this complexity thatexists in the natural world the question
 is where does it come from you know what secret does nature havethat lets it make all this complexity
 that we humans when we engineer things typically are not making we're typicallymaking things that at least look quite
 simple to us and so the shock here was even from something very simple you'remaking something that complex maybe this
 is getting at sort of the secret that nature has that allows it to make reallycomplex things even though its
 underlying rules may not be that complex how did it make you feel if we if we

1:56:30
Speaker 0 :look at the Newton Apple was there was
 it was there you know you took a walk and in something it profoundly hit youor was this a gradual thing a lot of


1:56:43
Speaker 1 :truth the truth of every sort of science
 discovery is it's not that gradual I mean I've spent I happen to beinterested in scientific biography kinds
 of things and so I've tried to track down you know how did people come tofigure out this or that thing and
 there's always a long kind of sort of preparatory you know there's a there's aneed to be prepared in a mindset in
 which it's possible to see something I mean in the case of rule 30 our eyesaround June 1st 1984 was some kind of a
 silly story in some ways I finally had a high-resolution laser printer so I wasable so I thought I'm gonna generate a
 bunch of pictures of these cellular automata and I generate this one and Iput it on some plane flight for to
 Europe you know have this with me and it's like you know I really should tryto understand this and this is really
 you know this is I really don't understand what's going on and that waskind of the you know slowly trying to
 trying to see what was happening as it was not it was depressingly uncertain soto speak in the sense that a lot of
 these ideas like principle of computational equivalence for exampleyou know I thought well that's a
 possible thing I didn't know if it's correct still don't know for sure thatit's correct but it's sort of a gradual
 thing that these things gradually kind of become seem more important than onethought I mean I think the whole idea of
 studying the computational universe of simple programs it took me probably adecade decade and a half to kind of
 internalize that that was really an important idea um and I think you knowif it turns out we find the whole
 universe looking out there in the computational universe that's a good youknow it's a good brownie point or
 something for the for the whole idea but I think that the the thing that strangein this whole question about you know
 finding this different raw material for making models of things um what's beeninteresting sort of in the in sort of
 arc of history is you know for 300 years it's kind of like the the mathematicalequations approach it was the winner it
 was the thing you know you want to have a really a good model for somethingthat's what you use the thing that's
 been remarkable is just in the last decade or so I think one can see atransition to using not mathematical
 equations but programs as sort of the raw material for making models of stuffand that's pretty neat and it's kind of
 you know as somebody who's kind of lived inside this paradigm shift so to speakit is bizarre I mean no doubt instead of
 the history of science that will be seen as an instantaneous paradigm shift butit sure isn't instantaneous when it's
 played out in one's actual life so to speak tryit seems glacial and and it's the kind
 of thing where where it's sort of interesting because in the dynamics ofsort of the adoption of ideas like that
 into different fields the younger the field the faster the adoption typicallybecause people are not kind of locked in
 with the fifth generation of people who've studied this field and it is itis the way it is and it can never be any
 different and I think that's been you know watching that process has beeninteresting I mean I'm I'm I think I'm
 fortunate that I I've I I do stuff mainly because I like doing it and if Iwas some that makes me kind of
 thick-skinned about the world's response to what I do um and but that'sdefinitely you know and anytime you you
 write a book called something like a new kind of science it's kind of the thepitchforks will come out for the for the
 old kind of science and I was was interesting dynamics I think that the II have to say that I was fully aware of
 the fact that the when you see sort of incipient paradigm shifts in science thevigor of the negative response upon
 early introduction is a fantastic positive indicator of good long-termresults so in other words if people just
 don't care it's um you know that's not such a good sign if they're like oh thisis great that means you didn't really
 discover anything interesting um what

2:01:01
Speaker 0 :fascinating properties of rule 30 have
 you discovered over the years you've recently announced the rule 30 prizesfor solving three key problems can you
 maybe talk about interesting properties that have been kind of revealed rule 30or other cellular automata and what
 problems are still before us like the three problems you've announced yeah

2:01:22
Speaker 1 :yeah right so I mean the most
 interesting thing about cellular automata is that it's hard to figurestuff out about them and that's some in
 a sense every time you try and sort of you try and bash them with some othertechnique you say can i crack them the
 answer is they seem to be uncrackable they seem to have the feature that theyare that they're sort of showing
 irreducible computation they're not you're not able to say oh I know exactlywhat this is going to do it's going to
 do this or that but there's a specific

2:01:56
Speaker 0 :formulations of that fact yes right so I


2:01:58
Speaker 1 :mean for example in in rule 30 in the
 pattern you get just starting from a single black cell you get this sort ofvery very sort of random
 pattern and so one feature of that just look at the center column and forexample we used that for a long time to
 generate random the symbol from language um just you know what rule 30 producesnow the question is can you prove how
 random it is so for example one very simple question can you prove that andnever repeat nope we haven't been able
 to show that will never repeat we know that if there are two adjacentcolumns we know they can't both repeat
 but just knowing whether that center column can ever repeat we still don'teven know that um another problem that
 I've sort of put in my collection of you know it's like $30,000 for three youknow for these three prizes for about
 rule thirty I would say this is not one of those is one of those cases where themoney is not the main point but it's
 just you know helps some motivate somehow that the investigation sothere's three problems you propose you


2:03:06
Speaker 0 :get thirty thousand dollars if you solve
 all three or maybe yeah no it's ten

2:03:10
Speaker 1 :thousand for each for each a my the


2:03:14
Speaker 0 :problems that's right money's not the
 thing the problems themselves are just

2:03:19
Speaker 1 :clean yeah right it's just you know will
 it ever become periodic second problem is other an equal number of black andwhite cells down the middle calm down
 the middle column and the third problem is a little bit harder to state which isessentially is there a way of figuring
 out what the color of a cell at position T down the center column is in a with aless computational effort than about T
 steps so in other words is there way to jump ahead and say I know what this isgonna do you know it's just some
 mathematical function of T or proving

2:03:53
Speaker 0 :that there is no way or proving there is


2:03:55
Speaker 1 :no way yes but both I mean you know for
 any one of these one could prove that you know one could discover you know weknow what rule thirty does for a billion
 steps but and maybe we'll know for a trillion steps before two very long butmaybe at a quadrillion steps it suddenly
 becomes repetitive you might say how could that possibly happen but so when Iwas writing up these prizes I thought
 and this is typical of what happens in the computational universe I thought letme find an example where it looks like
 it's just gonna be random forever but actually it becomes repetitive yeah andI found one and it's just you know I did
 a search I searched I don't know maybe a million different rules with somecriterion and this is what's sort of
 interesting about that is I kind of have this thing that I per se got a silly wayabout the computational universe which
 is you know the animals are always smarter than youthat is there's always some way one of
 these computational systems is gonna figure out how to do something eventhough I can't imagine how its gonna do
 it and you know I didn't think I would find one that you know you would thinkof for all these years that what I found
 sort of all possible things funky things that that I would have that I would havegotten my intuition wrapped around the
 idea that you know these creatures are always in the computational universe arealways smarter than I'm gonna be but you
 know they're equivalently yes Mari that's correct and that makes it thatmakes one feel very sort of it's it's
 it's humbling every time because every time the thing is is you know you thinkit's gonna do this so it's not gonna be
 possible to do this and it turns out it finds a way of course the promising

2:05:32
Speaker 0 :thing is there's a lot of other rules
 like rule 30 it's just rule 30 is oh it's my favorite

2:05:37
Speaker 1 :because I found it first and that's


2:05:40
Speaker 0 :right but the problems are focusing on
 rule 30 it's possible that rule 30 is is repetitive after trillion steps and thatdoesn't prove anything about the other
 rules it does not but this is a good sort of experiment of how you go abouttrying to prove something about a stick


2:05:57
Speaker 1 :you'll rule yes and it also all these
 things help build intuition that is intact if it turned out that this wasrepetitive tore trillion steps that's
 not what I would expect and so we learned something from that the method

2:06:10
Speaker 0 :to do that though would reveal something
 interesting about the so no doubt no

2:06:13
Speaker 1 :doubt
 I mean it's although it's sometimes challenging like the you know I put outa prize in 2007 for for a particular
 Turing machine that I there was the simplest candidate for being theuniversal Turing machine and the young
 chap in England named Alex Smith after a smallish number of months said I've gota proof and he did you know I took a
 little while to iterate but you had a proof unfortunately the proof is veryit's it's a lot of micro details it's
 it's not it's not like you look at it you say aha there's a big new principlethe big new principle is the simplest
 Turing machine that might have been Universal actually is universal and it'sincredibly much simpler than the
 turning machines that people already knew we universal before that and sothat intuition Allah is important
 because it says computation universality is closer at home than you might havethought um but the actual methods are
 not in that particular case were not terribly illuminate happiness if their

2:07:15
Speaker 0 :methods would also be elegant that's


2:07:18
Speaker 1 :true
 yeah no I mean I think it's it's one of these things where I mean it's it's likea lot of we've talked about earlier kind
 of you know opening up a eyes and machine learning and things of what'sgoing on inside and is it just step by
 step or can you sort of see the bigger picture more abstractly and

2:07:36
Speaker 0 :unfortunately with Verma's Last Theorem
 proof it's unfortunate that the proof to such an elegant theorem is is not I meanit's as if it's not it doesn't write
 into the margins of a page that's true

2:07:49
Speaker 1 :but these know one of the things is
 that's another consequence of computational or disability this thisfact that there are even quite short
 results in mathematics whose proofs arbitrarily long yes that's a that's aconsequence of all this stuff and it's
 it's a it makes one wonder you know how come mathematics is possible at all whyis you know why is it the case how
 people manage to navigate doing mathematics through looking at thingswhere they're not just throwing into
 it's all undecidable that's that's its own own separate separate story and that

2:08:24
Speaker 0 :would be that would they would have a
 poetic beauty to it as if people were to find something interesting about rule 30because I mean there's an emphasis to
 this particular rule it wouldn't say anything about the broad irreducibilityof all computations but it would
 nevertheless put a few smiles on people's faces of well yeah yeah but to

2:08:45
Speaker 1 :me it's like in a sense establishing
 principle of computational equivalence it's a little bit like doing inductivescience anywhere that is the more
 examples you find the more convinced you are that it's generally true I mean wedon't get to you know whenever we do
 natural science we we say well it's true here that this will that happens can wecan we prove that it's true everywhere
 in the universe no we can't so you know it's the same thing herewe're exploring the computational
 universe we're establishing facts in the computational universe and that's that'ssort of a way of of inductively
 concluding general things just to think

2:09:30
Speaker 0 :through this a little bit we've touched
 on it a little bit before but what's the difference between the kind ofcomputation now that we're talking about
 cellular automata what's the difference between the kind of computationbiological systems our mind our bodies
 the things we see before us that emerged through the process of evolution andcellular automata deep
 I mean we've kind of applied to the discussion of physics underlyingeverything but we we talked about the
 potential equivalents of the fundamental laws of physics and the kind ofcomputation going on internal machinery
 interesting about the kind of computation that our bodies do right

2:10:14
Speaker 1 :well let's talk about brains primary
 range the the I mean I think the the most important thing about the thingsthat our brains do that we care about
 them in the sense that there's a lot of computation going on out there in youknow cellular automata and and you know
 physical systems and so on and it just it does what it does it follows thoserules it does what it does
 the thing that's special about the computation in our brains is that it'sconnected to our goals and our current
 whole societal story and you know I think that's the that's that's thespecial feature and now the question
 then is when you see this whole sort of ocean of computation out there how doyou connect that to the things that we
 humans care about and in a sense a large part of my life has been involved insort of the technology of how to do that
 and you know what I've been interested in is kind of building computationallanguage that allows that something that
 both we humans can understand and that can be used to determine computationsthat are actually computations we care
 about see I think when you look at something like one of these cellularautomata and it does some complicated
 thing you say that's fun but why do I care well youcould say the same thing actually in
 physics you say oh I've got this material and it's a ferrite or somethingwhy do I care you know it's some has
 some magnetic properties why do I care it's amusing but why do I carewell we end up caring because you know
 ferrite is what's used to make magnetic tape magnetic disks whatever or you knowwe could use the coke crystals as made
 used to make um well not that she increasingly not but it has been used tomake computer displays and so on but
 those are so in a sense where mining these things that happen to exist in thephysical universe and I'm making it be
 something that we care about because we sort of in train it into technology andit's the same thing in the computational
 universe that a lot of what's out there is stuff that's just happening butsometimes we have some objective and we
 will go and sort of mine the computational universe for somethingthat's useful for some particular
 objective on a large scale trying to do that trying to sort of navigate thecomputational universe to do useful
 things you know that's where computational language comes in and youknow a lot of what I've spent time doing
 and building this thing we call Wolfram language which I've been building forthe last one third of a century now and
 kind of the goal there is to have a way to express kind of computationalthinking computational thoughts in a way
 that both humans and machines can understand so it's kind of like in thetradition of computer languages
 programming languages that the tradition there has been more let's take what howcomputers are built and let's specify
 let's have a human way to specify do this do this do this at the level of theway that computers are built what I've
 been interested in is representing sort of the whole world computationally andbeing able to talk about whether it's
 about cities or chemicals or you know this kind of algorithm or that kind ofalgorithm things that have come to exist
 in our civilization and the sort of knowledge base of our civilization beingable to talk directly about those in a
 computational language so that both we can understand it and computers canunderstand
 I mean the thing that I've been sort of excited about recently which I had onlyrealized recently which is kind of
 embarrassing but trim is kind of the the arc of what we've tried to do inbuilding this kind of computational
 language is it's a similar kind of arc of what happened when mathematicalnotation was invented so go back 400
 years people were trying to do math they were always explaining their math inwords and it was pretty conky and as
 soon as mathematical notation was invented you could start defining thingslike algebra and later calculus and so
 on it all became much more streamlined when we deal with computational thinkingabout the world there's a question of
 what is the notation what is the what is the kind of formalism that we can use totalk about the world computationally and
 in a sense that's what I've spent the last third of a century trying to buildand we finally got to the point where we
 have a pretty full scale computational language that sort of talks about theworld and that's that's exciting because
 it means that just like having this mathematical notation let us talk aboutthe world mathematically we now and and
 let us built up build up these kind of mathematical sciences now we have acomputational language which allows us
 to start talking about the world computationally and lets us you know myview of it is it's kind of computational
 X for all X all these different fields of you know computational thiscomputational that that's what we can
 now build let's step back so first of

2:15:07
Speaker 0 :all the mundane
 what is Wolfram language in terms of sort of I mean I can answer the questionfor you but this it basically not the
 philosophical deep to profound the impact of it I'm talking about in termsof tools in terms of things you can
 download and yeah you can play with what is it what what does it fit into theinfrastructure what are the different
 ways to interact with it right so I mean

2:15:33
Speaker 1 :that the two big things that people have
 sort of perhaps heard of that come from open language one is Mathematica theother is Wolfram Alpha so Mathematica
 first came out 1988 it's this system that is basically a instance of Wolframlanguage and it's used to do
 computations particularly in sort of technical areas and the typical thingyou're doing is you're you're typing
 little pieces of computational language and you're getting computations done

2:16:05
Speaker 0 :it's very kind of there's like as
 symbolic yeah it's a symbolic language

2:16:09
Speaker 1 :

2:16:10
Speaker 0 :so symbolic language took any I don't
 know how to cleanly express that but that makes a very distinct from what howwe think about sort of I don't know
 programming in a Ling like Python or something right but so so the point is

2:16:22
Speaker 1 :that in a traditional programming
 language the raw material of the programming language it's just stuffthat computers intrinsically do and the
 point of often language is that what the language is talking about is things thatexist in the world or things that we can
 imagine and construct not it's not it's not sort of it's it's aimed to be anabstract language from the beginning and
 so for example one feature it has is that it's a symbolic language whichmeans that you know you the thing called
 you have an X just type in X and what why would you just say oh that's X itwon't say error undefined thing you know
 I don't know what it is computation you know but in terms of the in terms ofcomputer now that X could perfectly well
 be you know the city of Boston that's a thing that's a symbolic thing or itcould perfectly well be the you know the
 trajectory of some spacecraft represented as a symbolic thing and thatidea that one can work with sort of
 computationally work with these different these kinds of things thatthat exist in the world or describe the
 world that's really powerful and that's what some I mean you know when I starteddesigning well I designed the
 predecessor of what's now often language was a thing called SMP which was myfirst computer language I am I kind of
 wanted to have this the sort of infrastructure for computation which wasas fundamental as possible I mean this
 is what I got for having bit of physicists and tried to find you knowfundamental components of things and
 wound up with this kind of idea of transformation rules for symbolicexpressions as being sort of the
 underlying stuff from which computation would bebuilt and that's what we've been
 building from in Wolfram language and you know operationally what happens it'sI would say by far the highest level
 computer language that exists and its really been built in a very differentdirection from other languages so other
 languages have been about there is a lot core languageit really is kind of wrapped around the
 operations that a computer intrinsically does maybe people add libraries for thisor that that but the goal of Wolfram
 language is to have the language itself be able to cover this sort of very broadrange of things that show up in the
 world and that means that you know there are 6,000 primitive functions in theWolfram language that cover things you
 know I could probably pick a a random here I'm gonna pick just because justfor fun I'll pick them let's take a
 random sample of them of all the things that we have here so let's just sayrandom sample of 10 of them and let's
 see what we get Wow okay so these are really different things from functionsthese are all functions boolean converts
 okay that's the thing for converting between different types of booleanexpressions so for people are just


2:19:25
Speaker 0 :listening human type 10 random sample
 names sampling from all functionally how many you said there might six thousandsix thousand six thousand ten of them
 and there's a hilarious variety of them

2:19:37
Speaker 1 :yeah right well we've got things about
 some dollar requests or a dress that has to do with interacting with the theworld of the of the cloud and so on
 discrete wavelet data it's for ROI a

2:19:50
Speaker 0 :graphical sort of window yeah yeah


2:19:53
Speaker 1 :window moveable that's the user
 interface kind of thing I want to pick another 10 cuz I think this is some okayso yeah there's a lot of infrastructure
 stuff here that you see if you if you just start sampling at random there's alot of kind of infrastructural things if
 you're more you know if you more look at the some of the exciting machine

2:20:08
Speaker 0 :learning stuff is shut off is that also
 in this pool oh yeah yeah I mean you

2:20:11
Speaker 1 :know so one of those functions is like
 image identify as a function here where you just say image identifiedwas good too let's do this let's say
 current image and let's pick up an image

2:20:26
Speaker 0 :hopefully just a current image accessing
 the webcam took a picture yourself

2:20:32
Speaker 1 :anyway we can say image identify open
 square brackets and then we just paste that picture in there imagine if I

2:20:40
Speaker 0 :function running come to picture lo and


2:20:42
Speaker 1 :it says oh wow it says I look I look
 like a plunger because I got this great big thing behind me classify so this

2:20:47
Speaker 0 :image identify classifies the most
 likely object in in the image in it so there's a wonder okay that's that that's

2:20:54
Speaker 1 :a bit embarrassing let's see what it
 does let's pick the top 10 um okay well it thinks there's oh it thinks it'spretty unlikely that it's a primary two
 hominid two plus eight percent

2:21:05
Speaker 0 :probability yeah that's that's five
 seven it's a plunger yeah well so if we will not give you an existential crisisand then uh eight percent or not I
 should say percent but no that's a scent

2:21:17
Speaker 1 :that it's a hominid um and yeah okay
 it's really I'm gonna do another one of these just because I'm embarrassed thatit there we go let's try that let's see
 what that did um we took a picture a little bit a little bit more of me andnot just my bald head so to speak okay
 eighty-nine percent problem is it's a person so that there so then I would umbut you know so this is image identify
 as an example of one of just one of them

2:21:47
Speaker 0 :in just one function and that's part of
 the that's like part of the language yes

2:21:52
Speaker 1 :so first I mean you know something like
 um I could say I don't know let's find the geo nearest what could we find let'sfind the nearest volcano um let's find
 the ten I wonder where it thinks here is let's try finding the ten volcanoesnearest here okay yo nearest volcano


2:22:14
Speaker 0 :here 10 years volcanoes right let's find


2:22:18
Speaker 1 :out where those oh we can now we got a
 list of volcanoes out and I can say geo list plot that and hopefully okay sothere we go so there's a map that shows
 the positions of those ten volcanoes of the East Coast and the Midway

2:22:31
Speaker 0 :density well no we're okay okay there's
 not it's not too bad yeah they're not

2:22:36
Speaker 1 :very close to us we could we could
 measure how far away they are but you know the fact that right in the languageit knows about all the volcanoes in the
 world that knows you know computing what the nearest ones are it knows all themaps of the world and so on a


2:22:50
Speaker 0 :fundamentally different idea what a
 language is yeah right that's that's

2:22:53
Speaker 1 :what I like to talk about is you know a
 full scale computational language that's that's what we've tried to do and just

2:22:59
Speaker 0 :if you can comment briefly I mean this
 kind of the Wolfram language along with Wolfram Alpha represents kind of whatthe dream of what AI is supposed to be
 there's now a sort of a craze of learning kind of idea that we can takeraw data and from that extract the the
 different hierarchies of abstractions and in order to be able to under thekind of things that well from language
 operates with but we're very far from learning systems being able to form that

2:23:31
Speaker 1 :but like the context of history of AI if


2:23:34
Speaker 0 :you could just comment on there is a you
 said computation X and there's just some sense where in the 80's and 90's sort ofexpert systems represented a very
 particular computation ax yes right and there's a kind of notion that thoseefforts didn't pan out right but then
 out of that emerges kind of Wolfram language Wolfram Alpha which is thesuccess I mean yeah right I think those


2:24:00
Speaker 1 :are in some sense those efforts were too
 modest they're nice they were they were looking at particular areas and youactually can't do it with a particular
 area I mean like like even a problem like natural language understanding it'scritical to have broad knowledge of the
 world if you want to do good natural language understanding and you kind ofhave to bite off the whole problem if
 you if you say we're just gonna do the blocks world over here so to speakyou don't really it's it's it's actually
 it's one of these cases where it's easier to do the whole thing than it isto do some piece of it you know what one
 comment to make about so the relationship between what we've tried todo and sort of the learning side of AI
 you know in a sense if you look at the development of knowledge in ourcivilization as a whole there was kind
 of this notion for three hundred years ago or so now youwant to figure something out about the
 world you can reason it out you can do things which would just use raw humanthought and then along came sort of
 modern mathematical science and we found ways to just sort of blast through thatby in that case writing down equations
 now we also know we can do that with computation and so on um and so that waskind of a different thing so when we
 look at how do we sort of encode knowledge and figure things out one waywe could do it is start from scratch
 learn everything it's just a neuron that figuring everything out but in a sensethat denies the sort of knowledge-based
 achievements of our civilization because in our civilization we have learnt lotsof stuff we've surveyed all the
 volcanoes in the world we've done you know we've figured out lots ofalgorithms for this or that those are
 things that we can encode computationally and that's what we'vetried to do and we're not saying just
 you don't have to start everything from scratch so in a sense a big part of whatwe've done is to try and sort of capture
 the knowledge of the world in computational form in computable formnow there's also some pieces which which
 were for a long time undoable by computers like imageidentification where there's a really
 really useful module that we can add that is those things which actually werepretty easy for humans to do that had
 been hard for computers to do I think the thing that's interesting that'semerging now is the interplay between
 these things between this kind of knowledge of the world that is in asense very symbolic and this kind of
 sort of much more statistical kind of things like image identification and soon and putting those together by having
 the sort of symbolic representation of image identification that that's wherethings get really interesting and where
 you can kind of symbolically represent patterns of things and images and so onum I think that's you know that's kind
 of a part of the path forward so to speak yeah so the dream of so the

2:26:46
Speaker 0 :machine learning is not when in my view
 I think the view of many people is not anywhere close to building the kind ofwide world of computable knowledge that
 Wolfram language would build but because you have a kind of you've you've donethe incredibly hard work of building
 this world now machine learning too can be conservativesto help you explore that world yeah and
 that's what you've added with the version 12 oh yeah if you all seeingsome demos it looks amazing right I mean


2:27:19
Speaker 1 :I think you know this it's sort of
 interesting to see the this sort of the once its computable once it's in thereit's running in sort of a very efficient
 computational way but then there's sort of things like the interface of how doyou get there
 you know how do you do natural language understanding to get there how do youhow do you pick out entities in a big
 piece of text or something um that's I mean actually a good example right nowis our NLP NL
 which is we've done a lot of stuff natural language understanding usingessentially not learning based methods
 using a lot of you know a little algorithmic methods human curationmethods and so on and so on people try


2:27:59
Speaker 0 :to enter a query and then converting so
 the process of converting NLU defined beautifully as converting their queryinto computation come into a
 computational language which is a very well first of all super practicaldefinition a very useful definition and
 then also a very clear definition right

2:28:19
Speaker 1 :writing right having a different thing
 is natural language processing where it's like here's a big lump of text gopick out all the cities in that text for
 example and so a good example you know so we do that we're using using modernmachine learning techniques um and it's
 actually kind of kind of an interesting process that's going on right now it'sthis loop between what do we pick up
 with NLP using machine learning versus what do we pick up with our more kind ofprecise computational methods in natural
 language understanding and so we've got this kind of loop going between thosewhich is improving both of them yeah I


2:28:56
Speaker 0 :think you have some of the state of the
 art transforms okay have Bert in there I think oh you know so Josey of you'reintegrating all the models I mean this
 is the hybrid thing that people have always dreamed about are talkingwell that makes she's just surprised
 frankly that Wolfram language is not more popular than already it already is

2:29:16
Speaker 1 :you know that's that's a it's a it's a
 complicated issue because it's like it involves you know it involves ideas andideas are absorbed absorbed slowly in
 the world I mean I think that and then

2:29:30
Speaker 0 :there's sort of like we're talking about
 there's egos and personalities and and some of the the absorption absorptionmechanisms of ideas have to do with
 personalities and the students of personalities and and then a littlesocial network so it's it's interesting
 how the spread of ideas works you know

2:29:48
Speaker 1 :what's funny with Wolfram language is
 that we are if you say you know what market sort of market penetration if youlook at the I would say very high-end of
 Rd and sort of the the people where you say wow that's a really you knowimpressive smart person they're very
 often users of our or from language very very often if you look at the more sortof it's a funny thing if you look at the
 more kind of I would say people who are like oh we're just plodding away doingwhat we do they're often not yet well
 from language users and that dynamic it's kind of odd that there hasn't beenmore rapid trickle down because we
 really you know the high-end we've really been very successful in for along time and it's it's some but was you
 know that's partly I think a consequence of my fault in the sense because it'skind of you know I have a company which
 is really emphasizes sort of creating products and building a sort of the bestpossible technical tower we can rather
 than sort of doing the commercial side of things and pumping it out and so yeahmost effective what and there's an


2:31:00
Speaker 0 :interesting idea that you know perhaps
 you can make more popular by opening everything everything up sort of thegithub bottle but there's an interesting
 I think I've heard you discussed this that that turns out not to work in a lotof cases like in this particular case
 that you want it you know that when you deeply care about the integrareally the quality of the knowledge that
 you're building that unfortunately you can't you can't distribute that effort

2:31:31
Speaker 1 :yeah it's not the nature of how things
 work I mean you know what we're trying to do is the thing that for better orworse requires leadership and it
 requires kind of maintaining a coherent vision over a long period of time anddoing not only the cool vision related
 work but also the kind of mundane in the trenches make the thing actually workwell work so how do you build the


2:31:56
Speaker 0 :knowledge because that's the fascinating
 thing that's the mundane the fascinating in the mundane as well building theknowledge they're adding integrating
 more data yeah I mean that's probably

2:32:05
Speaker 1 :not the most stunning that the things
 like get it to work in all these different cloud environments and so onthat's pretty you know it's very
 practical stuff you know have the user interface be smooth and you know havethere be take on him you know fraction
 of a millisecond to do this or that that's a lot of work and it's some it'sit's but you know I think my it's an
 interesting thing over the period of time you know often language has existedbasically for more than half of the
 total amount of time that any language any computer language has existed thatis computer language maybe 60 years old
 you know give or take um and both languages 33 years old so it's it's kindof a um and I think I was realizing
 recently there's been more innovation in the distribution of software thanprobably than in the structure of
 programming languages over that period of time and we you know we've been sortof trying to do our best to adapt to it
 and the good news is that we have you know because I have a simple privatecompany and so on that doesn't have you
 know a bunch of investors you know telling us we're gonna do this so that Ihave lots of freedom and what we can do
 and so for example we're able to oh I don't know we have this free Wolframengine for developers which is a free
 version for developers and we've been you know we've there a site licenses forfor mathematical more from language
 basically all major universities certainly in the u.s. by now so it'seffectively free to people
 and all the universities in effect and you know we've been doing a progressionof things I mean different things like
 Wolfram Alpha for example the main website is just a free website

2:33:47
Speaker 0 :what is Wolfram Alpha okay it wolf now


2:33:48
Speaker 1 :for is a system for answering questions
 where you ask in question with natural language and it'll try and generate areport telling you the answer to that
 question so the question could be something like you know what's thepopulation of Boston divided by New York
 compared to New York and it'll take those words and give you an answer andthat have inverts the words into


2:34:13
Speaker 0 :computable not into inter Wolfen


2:34:16
Speaker 1 :language a common language and the
 additional language and then could you don'ts in underlying knowledge belongs

2:34:21
Speaker 0 :to Wolfram Alpha to the Wolfram language
 what's the let's just call it the

2:34:25
Speaker 1 :Wolfram knowledge base knowledge base I
 mean it's it's been a that's been a big effort over the decades to collect allthat stuff and you know more of it flows
 in every second so can you just pause on

2:34:37
Speaker 0 :that for a second like that's the one of
 the most incredible things of course in the long term were from language itselfis the fundamental thing but in the
 amazing sort of short term the the knowledge base is kind of incredible sowhat's the process of building in that
 knowledge base the fact that you first of all from the very beginning thatyou're brave enough to start to take on
 the general knowledge base and how do you go from zero to the incredibleknowledge base that you have now well


2:35:11
Speaker 1 :yeah it was kind of scary at some level
 I mean I had I had wondered about doing something like this since I was a kid soit wasn't like I hadn't thought about it
 for a while but most of us most of the

2:35:20
Speaker 0 :brilliant dreamers give up such a such a
 difficult engineering notion at some

2:35:27
Speaker 1 :point right right well the thing that
 happened with me which was kind of it's a it's a live your own paradigm kind oftheory so basically what happened is I
 had assumed that to build something like wolf alpha would require sort of solvingthe general AI problem that's what I had
 assumed and so I kept on thinking about that and I thought I don't really knowdo that so I don't do anything then I
 worked on my new kind of science project and sort of exploring the computationaluniverse and came up with things like
 this principle of computational equivalence which say there is no brightline between the intelligence and the
 milli computational so I thought look that's this paradigm I've built you knownow it's you know now I have to eat that
 dog food myself so to speak you know I've been thinking about doing thisthing with computable knowledge forever
 and you know let me actually try and do it and so it was you know if my if myparadigm is right there miss should be
 possible but the beginning was certainly you know it's a bit daunting I rememberI took the the the the early team to a
 big reference library and we're like looking at this reference library andit's like you know my basic statement is
 our goal over the next year or two is to ingest everything that's in here andthat's you know it seemed very daunting
 but but in a sense I was well aware of the fact that it's finite you know thefact you can walk into the reference
 library it's big big thing with lots of reference books all over the place butit is finite you know this is not an
 infinite you know it's not the infinite corridor of so to speak of referencelibrary it's not truly infinite so to
 speak but but no I mean and then then what happenedsort of interesting there was from a
 methodology point of view was I didn't start off saying let me have a grandtheory for how all this knowledge works
 it was like let's you know implement this area this area this areaof a few hundred areas and so on it's a
 lot of work I also found that you know I've been fortunate in that our productsget used by sort of the world's experts
 and lots of areas and so that really helped because we were able to askpeople you know the world expert on this
 or that and were able to ask them for input and so on and I found that mygeneral principle was that any area
 where there wasn't some expert who helped us figure out what to do wouldn'tbe right and you know because our goal
 was to kind of get to the point where we had sort of true expert level knowledgeabout everything and so that you know
 that the ultimate goal is if there's a question that can be honeston the basis of general knowledge and a
 civilization make it be automatic to be able to answer that question and youknow and now well welcome I forgot used
 in serie from the very beginning and it's now a zoo isn't it Alexa and soit's people are kind of getting more of
 the you know they get more of the sense of this is what should be possible to doI mean in a sense the question answering
 problem was viewed as one of the sort of core AI problems for a long time I hadkind of an interesting experience I had
 a friend Marvin Minsky who was a well-known a AI person from from rightaround here and I remember when my morph
 mouthful was coming out um as a few weeks before it came out I think I mighthappen to see Marvin and I said I should
 show you this thing we have you know it's a question answering system and hewas like okay type something and it's
 like okay fine and then he's talking about something differentI said no Marvin you know this time it
 actually works you know look at this it actually works these types in a few morethings there's maybe ten more things of
 course we have a record of what he's typed in which is kind of interestingbut can you share where his mind was in


2:39:13
Speaker 0 :a testing space like what whoa all kinds


2:39:17
Speaker 1 :of random things he's trying random
 stuff you know medical stuff and you know chemistry stuff and you knowastronomy and so on it was like like you
 know after a few minutes he was like oh my god it actually works the the butthat was kind of told you something
 about the state you know what what happened in AI because people had youknow in a sense by trying to solve the
 bigger problem we were able to actually make something that would work now to befair you know we had a bunch of
 completely unfair advantages for example we already built a bunch of oftenlanguage which was you know very
 high-level symbolic language we had you know I had the practical experience ofbuilding big systems I have the sort of
 intellectual confidence to not just sort of give up and doing something like thisI think that the you know it is a it's
 always a funny thing you know I've worked on a bunch of big projects in mylife
 and I would say that the you know you mention ego I would also mentionoptimism so does it very carefully I
 mean in you know if somebody said this budget is gonna take 30 yearsum it's I you know it would be hard to
 sell me on that you know I'm always in the in the well I can kind of see a fewyears you know something's gonna happen
 a few years and usually it does something happens in a few years but thewhole the tale can be decades long and
 that's a that's a you know and from a personal point of view or is thechallenges you end up with these
 projects that have infinite tails and the question is - the tails kind of doyou just drown and kind of dealing with
 all of the tails of these projects and that's that's an interesting sort ofpersonal challenge and like my efforts
 now to work on fundamental theory or physics which I've just started doingand I'm having a lot of fun with it but
 it's kind of you know it's it's kind of making a bet that I can I can kind ofyou know I can do that as well as doing
 the incredibly energetic things that I'm trying to do with all from language andso on
 I mean vision yeah and underlying that I

2:41:27
Speaker 0 :mean I just talked for the second time
 with Elon Musk and that you you to share that quality a little bit of thatoptimism of taking on basically the
 daunting what most people call impossible and he and you take it on outof you can call it ego you can call it
 naivety you can call it optimism whatever the heck it is but that's howyou solve the impossible things yeah I


2:41:53
Speaker 1 :mean look at what happens and I don't
 know you know in my own case I you know it's been I progressed oligo a bit moreconfident and progressively able to you
 know decide that these projects aren't crazy but then the other thing is theother the other trap the one can end up
 with is oh I've done these projects and they're big let me never do a projectthat's any smaller than any project I've
 done so far and that's you know and that can be a trap and and often theseprojects are of completely unknown you
 know that their depth and significance is actuallyvery hard to know yeah I'm the sort of


2:42:33
Speaker 0 :building this giant knowledge base
 that's behind well from language WolframAlpha what do you think about theinternet what do you think about for
 example Wikipedia these large aggregations of text that's notconverted into computable knowledge do
 you think yeah well if you look at Wolfram language Wolfram Alpha 20 30maybe 50 years down the line do you hope
 to store all of the sort of Google's dream is to make all informationsearchable accessible but that's really
 as defined it's it's a it doesn't include the understanding of informationright do you hope to make all of
 knowledge represented with the hope so

2:43:24
Speaker 1 :that's what we're trying to do I'm hard


2:43:27
Speaker 0 :is that problem they could closing that


2:43:30
Speaker 1 :gap well it depends on the use cases I
 mean so if it's a question of answering general knowledge questions about theworld we're in pretty good shape on that
 right now if it's a question of representing like an area that we'regoing into right now is computational
 contracts being able to take something which would be written in legalese itmight even be the specifications for you
 know what should the self-driving car do when it encounters this or that or theother what should they you know whatever
 they you know write that in a computational language and be able toexpress things about the world you know
 if the creature that you see running across the road is a you know thing atthis point in the evil you know tree of
 life then it's worth this way otherwise don't those kinds of things are there

2:44:16
Speaker 0 :ethical components when you start to get
 to some of the messy human things are those in encoder well into computable

2:44:23
Speaker 1 :knowledge well I think that it is a
 necessary feature of attempting to automate more in the world that weencode more and more of ethics in a way
 that gets sort of quickly you know is able to be dealt with by computer I meanI've been involved recently I sort of
 got backed into being involved in the question ofautomated content selection on the
 internet so you know their Facebook's Google's Twitter's you know what how dothey rank the stuff they feed to us
 humans so to speak um and the question of what are you know what should neverbe fed to us what should be blocked
 forever what should be up ranked you know and what is the what are thecurrent principles behind that and what
 I kind of well a bunch of different things I realized about that but onething that's interesting is being able
 you know affect your building sort of an AI ethics you have to build an AI ethicsmodule in effect to decide is this thing
 so shocking I'm never gonna show it to people is this thing so whatever and andI did realize in thinking about that
 that you know there's not gonna be one of these things it's not possible todecide or it might be possible but it
 would be really bad for the future of our species if we just decided there'sthis one AI FX module and it's going to
 determine the the the practices of everything in the world so to speak andI kind of realized one has to sort of
 break it up and that's an that's an interesting societal problem of how onedoes that and how one sort of has people
 sort of self-identify for you know I'm buying in in the case of just contentselection it's sort of easier because
 it's like an individual's for an individual it's not something that kindof cuts across sort of societal
 boundaries but it's a really interesting

2:46:08
Speaker 0 :notion of I heard you'd describe I
 really like it sort of maybe in the sort of have different AI systems that have acertain kind of brand that they
 represent essentially Rowdy you could have like I don't know whether it'sconserve conservative or liberal and
 then libertarian and there's an R and E an Objectivist I exist I'm a differentethical and Co I mean it's almost
 encoding some of the ideologies which we've been struggling I come from aSoviet Union that didn't work out so
 well with the ideologies they worked out there so you you have but they alsoeverybody purchased that particular
 ethic system indeed and in the same I suppose could be done encodedthat that system could be encoded into
 computational knowledge and allow us to explore in the realm of in the digitalspace as that's the right exciting a
 possibility are you playing with those ideas and or from language yeah yeah I

2:47:10
Speaker 1 :mean the the the you know that's we open
 language has sort of the best opportunity to kind of express thoseessentially computational contracts
 about what to do now there's a bunch more work to be done to do it inpractice for you know deciding the is
 this a credible news story what does that mean or whatever whatever elseyou're going to pick I think that that's
 some you know that's the the question of well exactly what we get to do with thatis you know for me it's kind of a
 complicated thing because there are these big projects that I think aboutlike you know find the fundamental
 theory physics okay that's a possible one right bucks number two you knowsolve the IIx problem in the case of you
 know figure out how you rank old content so to speak and and decide what peoplesee that's that's kind of a box number
 two so to speak these are big projects and and I think waiting is more

2:48:02
Speaker 0 :important the the fundamental nature of
 reality or pennsville you ask it's one

2:48:06
Speaker 1 :of these things that's exactly like you
 know what's the ranking right it's the it's the ranking system and it's likewho's who's module do you use to rank
 that if you and I think come having multiple modules is really compelling

2:48:19
Speaker 0 :notion to us humans in a world where
 there's not clear that there's a right answer it perhaps you have systems that

2:48:29
Speaker 1 :

2:48:31
Speaker 0 :operate under different how would you
 say it I mean there's different value

2:48:35
Speaker 1 :systems based different value systems I
 mean I think you know in a sense the I mean I'm not really a politics orientedperson but but you know in the kind of
 totalitarianism it's kind of like you're gonna have this this system and that'sthe way it is I mean kind of the you
 know the concept is sort of a market-based system where you have okayI as a human I'm gonna pick this system
 I is another human I'm going to pick this system I mean that's in a sensethis case of automated content selection
 is a non-trivial but it is probably the easiest of the AI ethics situationsbecause it is each person gets to pick
 for themselves and there's not a huge interplay between what different peoplepick by the time you're dealing with
 other societal things like you know what should the policy of the central bank beor something or healthcare so now this


2:49:28
Speaker 0 :kind of centralized kind of things right


2:49:31
Speaker 1 :well I mean healthcare again has the
 feature that that at some level each person can pick for themselves so tospeak
 I mean whereas there are other things where there's a necessary Public Healththat's one example well that's not
 whether it doesn't get to be you know something which people can what theypick for themselves they may impose on
 other people and then it becomes a more non-trivial piece of sort of politicalphilosophy of course the central banking


2:49:53
Speaker 0 :system some would argue we would move we
 need to move away into digital currency and so on and Bitcoin and Ledger's andso on so yes there's a lot of we've been


2:50:02
Speaker 1 :quite involved in that and that's where
 that's sort of the motivation for computational contracts in part comesout of you know this idea oh we can just
 have this autonomously executing smart contract the idea of a computationalcontract is just to say you know have
 something where all of the conditions of the contract are represented incomputational form so in principle it's
 automatic text secured the contract and I think that's you know that will surelybe the future of you know the idea of
 legal contracts written in English or legalese or whatever and where peoplehave to argue about what goes on is is
 surely not you know we have a much more streamlined process if everything can berepresented computationally and the
 computers can kind of decide what to do I mean ironically enough you know oldgottfried leibniz back in the you know
 1600s was saying exactly the same thing but he had you know his pinnacle oftechnical achievement was this brass for
 function mechanical calculator thing that never really worked properlyactually um and you know so he was like
 300 years too early for that idea but now that idea is pretty realistic Ithink and you know you ask how much more
 difficult is it than what we have now a more from language toexpress I call it symbolic discourse
 language being able to express sort of everything in the world and kind ofcomputational symbolic form um I I think
 it is absolutely within reach I mean I think it's a you know I don't know maybeI'm just too much of an optimist but I
 think it's a it's a limited number of years to have a pretty well built outversion of that that will allow one to
 encode the kinds of things that are relevant to typical legal contracts andthese kinds of things


2:51:50
Speaker 0 :the idea of symbolic discourse language
 can you try to define the scope of what of what it is so we're having a

2:51:59
Speaker 1 :conversation it's a natural language can
 we have a representation of these sort of actionable parts of that conversationin a precise computable form so that a
 computer could go do it and not just

2:52:13
Speaker 0 :contracts but really sort of some of the
 things we think of as common sense essentially even just like basic notionsof human life well I mean things like


2:52:21
Speaker 1 :you know I am I'm getting hungry and
 want to eat something right right that that's something we don't have arepresentation you know in wolf language
 right now if I was like I'm eating blueberries and raspberries and thingslike that and I'm eating this amounts of
 them we know all about those kinds of fruits and plants and nutrition contentand all that kind of thing but the I
 want to eat them part of it is not covered yet um and that you know youneed to do that in order to have a


2:52:46
Speaker 0 :complete symbolic discourse language to
 be able to have a natural language conversation right right to be able to

2:52:53
Speaker 1 :express the kinds of things that say you
 know if it's a legal contract it's you know the parties desire to have this andthat and that's you know that's a thing
 like I want to eat of raspberry or something that that's what isn't that

2:53:07
Speaker 0 :that isn't this just throwing you said
 it's centuries old this dream yes but

2:53:13
Speaker 1 :

2:53:14
Speaker 0 :it's also the more near-term the dream
 of touring in formulating a tauren test

2:53:20
Speaker 1 :yes so do you do you hope do you think


2:53:27
Speaker 0 :that's the ultimate test of creating
 something special we said I tell I think

2:53:33
Speaker 1 :my special look if the test is does it
 walk and talk like a human well that's just the talking like a human but theanswer is it's an okay test if you say
 is it a test of intelligence you know people have attached wolf alpha the wolfnow for API - you know Turing test BOTS
 and those BOTS just lose immediately because all you have to do is ask itfive questions that you know about
 really obscure weird pieces of knowledge and it's just drop them right out andyou say that's not a human ID it's it's
 a it's a different thing it's achieving a different right now but it's yeah I

2:54:13
Speaker 0 :would argue not I would argue it's not a
 different thing it's actually legitimately Wolfram Alpha islegitimately
 languor Wolfram language only is legitimately trying to solve the touringDean tent of the Turing test perhaps the


2:54:27
Speaker 1 :intent yeah perhaps the intent I mean
 it's actually kind of fun you know I'm touring trying to work out he's thoughtabout taking encyclopedia britannica and
 you know making it computational in some way and he estimated how much work itwould be and actually I have to say he
 was a bit more pessimistic than the reality we did it more efficiently but

2:54:46
Speaker 0 :to him that represents


2:54:47
Speaker 1 :so I mean he was that he was almighty
 mental tasks yeah right he believes they had the same idea I mean it was you knowwe were able to do it more efficiently
 because we had a lot we had layers of automation that he I think hadn't youknow it's it's hard to imagine those
 layers of abstraction that end up being being built up but to him he represented

2:55:07
Speaker 0 :like an impossible task essentially well


2:55:09
Speaker 1 :he thought it was difficult he thought
 it was so you know maybe if he'd live another 50 years he would have been ableto do it I don't know in the interest of


2:55:15
Speaker 0 :time easy questions


2:55:17
Speaker 1 :

2:55:19
Speaker 0 :what is intelligence you talking I love


2:55:21
Speaker 1 :the way you say easy questions yeah you


2:55:26
Speaker 0 :talked about sort of rule 30 and so
 you're tammana humbling your sense of human beings having a monopoly andintelligence but in your in retrospect
 just looking broadly now with all the things you learn from computation whatis intelligence
 not intelligence arise

2:55:47
Speaker 1 :think there's a bright line of what
 intelligence is I think intelligence is at some level just computation but forus intelligence is defined to be
 computation that is doing things we care about and you know that's that's a veryspecial definition it's a very you know
 when you try and try and make it apps you know you trying to say wellintelligence this is problem-solving
 it's doing general this it's doing that they sudden the other thing it's it'soperating within a human environment
 type thing okay you know that's fine if you say well what's intelligence ingeneral you know that's I think that
 question is totally slippery and doesn't really have an answer as soon as you saywhat is it in general it quickly segues
 into this is what this is just computation so to speak but in a sea of

2:56:37
Speaker 0 :computation how many things if we were
 to pick randomly is your sense would have the kind of impressive to us humanslevels of intelligence meaning it could
 do a lot of general things that are useful to us humans right well according

2:56:54
Speaker 1 :to the principle of computational
 equivalents lots of them I mean in in you know if you ask me just in cellularautomata or something I don't know it's
 maybe 1% a few percent are achieve it varies actually it's a little bit as youget to slightly more complicated rules
 the chance that there'll be enough stuff there to to sort of reach this kind ofequivalence point it makes it maybe 1020
 percent of all of them so it's a it's very disappointing really I mean it'skind of like you know we think there's
 this whole long sort of biological evolution a kind of intellectualevolution that our cultural evolution
 that our species has gone through it's kind of disappointing to think that thathasn't achieved more but it has achieved
 something very special to us it just hasn't achieved something generally moreso to speak but what do you think about


2:57:48
Speaker 0 :this extra feels like human thing of
 subjective experience of consciousness what is consciousness well I think it's

2:57:55
Speaker 1 :a deeply slippery thing and I'm always
 I'm always wondering what my seller wrote on to feelI mean what do they feel now you're


2:58:03
Speaker 0 :wondering as an observer yeah yeah yeah


2:58:05
Speaker 1 :who's to know I mean I think that the
 you think sorry to interrupt do you

2:58:08
Speaker 0 :think consciousness can emerge from
 computation yeah I mean everything

2:58:13
Speaker 1 :whatever you mean by it it's going to be
 I mean you know look I have to tell a little story I was at an area fixconference fairly recently and people
 were I think I maybe I brought it up but I was like talking about right surveyeyes
 when will they eyes hope when when should we think of a eyes as havingrights when when should we think that
 it's immoral to destroy the memories of a eyes for example um those those kindsof things and and some actual
 philosopher in this case it's usually the techies who are the most naive butbut Tim in this case it was a
 philosopher who sort of piped up and said well you know the eyes will haverights when we know that they have
 consciousness I'm like good luck with that it's it's a it's a I mean this is ayou know it's a very circular thing you
 end up you'll end up saying this thing that has sort of you know when you talkabout having subjective experience I
 think that's just another one of these words that doesn't really have a a youknow there's no ground truth definition
 of what that means by the way I would

2:59:28
Speaker 0 :say I I do personally think that'll be a
 Taiwan hey I will demand rights and I think they'll demand rights when theysay they have consciousness which is not


2:59:42
Speaker 1 :a circular definition well so actually a
 human including where where the humans encouraged it and said it basically youknow we want you to be more like us
 because we're gonna be you know interacting with with you and so we wantyou to be sort of very Turing test like
 you know just like us and it's like yeah we're just like you we want to vote intowhat here which is a I mean it's it's a
 it's an interesting thing to think through in a world whereconsciousnesses are not counted like
 humans are that's a complicated business

3:00:19
Speaker 0 :so in many ways you've launched quite a
 few ideas revolutions that could in some number of years have huge amount ofimpact sort of more than they had even
 had already there might be any to me

3:00:35
Speaker 1 :

3:00:36
Speaker 0 :cellular automata is a fascinating world
 that I think could potentially even this but even be even beside the discussionof fundamental laws of physics just
 might be the idea of computation might be transformational the society in a waywe can't even predict yet but it might
 be years away that's true I mean I think

3:00:58
Speaker 1 :you can kind of see the map actually
 it's not it's not it's not mysterious I mean the fact is that you know this ideaof computation is sort of a you know
 it's a big paradigm that lots lots and lots of things are fitting into and it'skind of like you know we talk about you
 talk about I don't know this company this organization has momentum andwhat's doing we talk about these things
 that were you know we've internalized these concepts from Newtonian physicsand so on in time things like
 computational irreducibility will become as you know as I was amused recently Ihappen to be testifying at the US Senate
 and so I was amused that the the term computational irreducibility is now canbe you know it's it's on the
 Congressional Record and being repeated by people away in those kinds ofsettings and that that's only the
 beginning because you know computational irreducibility for example will end upbeing something really important for i
 mean it's it's it's kind of a funny thing that that you know one can kind ofsee this inexorable phenomenon i mean
 it's you know as more and more stuff becomes automated and computational andso on so these core ideas about how
 computation work necessarily become more and more significant and i think one ofthe things for people like neil like
 kind of trying to figure out sort of big stories and so on it says one of the oneof the bad features is
 it takes unbelievably long time for things to happen on a human time scalethe time scale of of of history it's all
 looks instantaneous blink of an eye but

3:02:36
Speaker 0 :let me ask the human question do you
 pawn your mortality your own mortality

3:02:42
Speaker 1 :goes I do yeah ever since I've been
 interested in that for you know it's it's a-you know the big discontinuity ofhuman history will come when when one
 achieves effective human immortality and that's that's gonna be the biggestdiscontinuity in human history if you
 could be immortal would you choose to be

3:02:58
Speaker 0 :

3:02:59
Speaker 1 :oh yeah I'm having fun
 geez do you think it's possible that

3:03:03
Speaker 0 :mortality is the thing that gives
 everything meaning and makes it fun yeah

3:03:11
Speaker 1 :that's a complicated issue right I mean
 the the way that human motivation will evolve when there is effective humanimmortality is unclear I mean if you
 look at sort of you know you look at the human condition as it now exists and youlike change that you know you change
 that knob so to speak it doesn't really work you know the human condition as itnow exists has you know mortality is
 kind of something that is deeply factored into the human condition as itnow exists and I think that that's I
 mean it is indeed an interesting question is you know from a purelyselfish I'm having fun point of view so
 to speak it's it's easy to say hey I could keep doing this forever thisthere's an infinite collection of things
 I'd like to figure out but I think the you know what the future of historylooks like in a time of human
 immortality is is an interesting one I mean I I my own view of this I was veryI was kind of unhappy about that because
 I was kind of you know it's like okay forget sort of biological form you knoweverything becomes digital everybody is
 you know it's the it's the giant you know the cloud of a trillion Souls typething um and then you know and then that
 seems boring because it's like play video games the rest of eternitything um but what I think I I I'm in my
 my I I got some less depressed about that idea on realizing that if you lookat human history and you say what was
 the important thing the thing people said was the you know this is the bigstory at any given time in history it's
 changed a bunch and it you know whether it's you know why am i doing what I'mdoing
 well there's a whole chain of discussion about well I'm doing this because ofthis because of that and a lot of those
 because is would have made no sense a thousand years ago how do you even asense even the so the interpretation of


3:05:17
Speaker 0 :the human condition even the meaning of
 life changes over time well I mean why

3:05:23
Speaker 1 :do people do things you know it's it's
 if you say whatever I mean the number of people in I don't know doing you knownumber of people at MIT you say they're
 doing what they're doing for the greater glory of God is probably not that largeyeah
 whereas if you go back five hundred years you'd find a lot of people who aredoing kind of creative things that's
 what they would say um and so today

3:05:47
Speaker 0 :because you've been thinking about
 computation so much and been humbled by it what do you think is the meaning oflife


3:05:54
Speaker 1 :well it's do that's it that's the thing
 well I don't know what meaning I mean you know my attitude is I you know I dothings which I find fulfilling to do I'm
 not sure that that I can necessarily justify you know each and every thingthat I do on the basis of some broader
 context I mean I think that for me it so happens that the things I findfulfilling to do some of them are quite
 big some of them are much smaller you know I I there things that I've notfound interesting earlier in my life and
 I know I found interesting like I got interested in like education andteaching people things and so on which I
 didn't find that interesting when I was younger um and you know can I justifythat in some big global sense I don't
 think I mean I I can I can describe why I think it might be important in theworld but I think my local reason for
 doing it is that I find it personally fulfilling which I can't you knowexplain in a sort of it's just like this
 discussion of things like AI ethics you know is there a ground truth to theethics that we should be having I don't
 think I can find a ground truth to my life any more than I can suggest aground truth for kind of the ethics for
 the whole for the whole of civilization and I think that's a you know my youknow it would be it would be a yeah it's
 it's sort of a I think I'm I'm you know at different times in my life I've haddifferent kind of gold structures and so
 on although your perspective your local

3:07:33
Speaker 0 :your you're just a cell in the cellular
 automata and but in some sense I find it funny from my observation is I kind ofyou know it seems that the universe is
 using you to understand itself it's some sense you're not aware of it yeah well

3:07:50
Speaker 1 :right well if it turns out that we
 reduce sort of all of the universe to some some simple rule everything isconnected so to speak and so it is
 inexorable in that case that you know if if I'm involved in finally how that ruleworks then you know then that say I'm
 then it's inexorable that the universe set it up that way but I think you knowone of the things I find a little bit
 you know this goal of finally fundamental theory of physics forexample if indeed we end up as the sort
 of virtualized consciousness the the disappointing feature is people wouldprobably care less about the fundamental
 theory of physics in that setting than they would now because gosh it's likeyou know what the machine code is down
 below underneath this thing is much less important if you're virtualized so tospeak and I think the although I think
 my my own personal you talk about ego I find it just amusing that um you knowkind of a you know if you're if you're
 imagining that sort of virtualized consciousness like what does thevirtualized consciousness do for the
 rest of eternity well you can explore you know the videogame that representsthe universe as the universe is or you
 can go off you can go off that reservation and goand start exploring the computational
 universe of all possible universes yeah and so in some vision of the future ofhistory it's like the disembodied
 consciousness is are all sort of pursuing things like my new kind ofscience sort of for the rest of eternity
 so to speak and that that ends up being the the kind of the the thing that umrepresents the you know the future of
 kind of the human condition I don't

3:09:36
Speaker 0 :think there's a better way to end it
 Stephen thank you so much the huge honor I'm talking today thank you so much this

 perhaps a little humbling to discover that we as humans are in effectcomputationally no more capable than the
 cellular automata was very simple rules but the principle of computationalequivalence also implies that the same
 is ultimately true of our whole universe so while science has often made it seemthat we as humans are somehow
 insignificant compared to the universe the principle of computationalequivalence now shows that in a certain
 sense we're at the same level for the principle implies that what goes oninside us can ultimately achieve just
 the same level of computational sophistication as our whole universethank you for listening and hope to see
