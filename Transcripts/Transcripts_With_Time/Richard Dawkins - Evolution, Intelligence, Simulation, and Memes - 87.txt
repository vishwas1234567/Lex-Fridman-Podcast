Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Richard Dawkins an evolutionary biologist and author of The Selfish Genethe blind watchmaker The God Delusion
 the magic of reality and the greatest show of Earth and his latest Islegrowing God he is the originator and
 popularizer of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology andscience in general including funny
 enough the introduction of the word meme in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene whichin the context of a gene-centred view of
 evolution is an exceptionally powerful ideahe's outspoken bold and often fearless
 in the defense of science and reason and in this way is one of the mostinfluential thinkers of our time this
 conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic for everyonefeeling the medical psychological and
 financial burden of this crisis I'm sending wealth your way stay strongwe're in this together we'll beat this
 thing this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy itsubscribe on YouTube review it with five
 stars on a podcast supported on patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter andlex Friedman spelled Fri D ma n as usual
 I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that canbreak the flow of the conversation I
 hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experiencethis show is presented by cash app the
 number one finance app in the App Store when you get it you just collectspodcast cash app lets you send money to
 friends buy Bitcoin and invest in the stock market with as little as onedollar since cash app allows you to send
 and receive money digitally peer-to-peer security in all digital transactions isvery important let me mention the PCI
 data security standard a cash app is compliant with I'm a big fan ofstandards for safety and security PCI
 DSS is a good example of that or a bunch of competitors got together and agreedthat there needs to be a global standard
 around the security of transactions now we just need to do the same forautonomous vehicles and artificial
 intelligence systems in general so again if you get cash app from the App StoreGoogle Play and use the collects podcast
 you get ten dollars in cash up will also donate ten dollars the first anorganization that is helping to advance
 robotics and STEM education for young people around the world and now here'smy conversation with Richard Dawkins
 do you think there's intelligent life

0:02:33
Speaker 0 :out there in the universe well if we
 accept that intelligent life here and reassess the number of planets in theuniverse is gigantic I mean 10 to 22
 stars has been estimated it seems to me highly likely that there is not onlylife in the universe elsewhere but also
 intelligent life if you deny that then you're committed to the view that thethings that happened on this planet are
 staggeringly improbable I mean ludicrously off-the-charts improbableand I don't think it's that improbable
 certainly the origin of life itself they're really two steps the origin oflife which is probably fairly improbable
 and then the subsequent evolution to intelligent life which is also fairly aproblem so the juxtaposition of those
 two you could say is pretty improbable but not 10 to the 22 in problem it's aninteresting question maybe you're coming
 on to it how we would recognize intelligence from outer space if we ifwe encountered it the most likely way we
 would come across them would be by radio it's highly unlikely they'd ever visitus but um it's not it's not that
 unlikely that we would pick up radio signals and then we would have to havesome means of deciding as it was
 intelligent people have people involved in the SETI program discuss how theywould do it and things like prime
 numbers would be an obvious thing to and always an obvious way for them tobroadcast to say we are intelligent we
 are here I suspect it probably would be obvious actually that's interesting

0:04:01
Speaker 1 :prime number so the mathematical
 patterns it's an open question whether mathematics is the same for us and as itwould be for aliens I suppose we could
 assume that ultimately if we were governed by the same laws of physics andwe should be governed by the same laws


0:04:18
Speaker 0 :of mathematics I think so
 I suspect that they will have Pythagoras theorem etc and I don't think thatmathematics will be that different do


0:04:25
Speaker 1 :you think evolution would also be a
 force on the alien planets I stuck my

0:04:30
Speaker 0 :neck out and said that if we do if ever
 that we do discover life elsewhere it will be Darwinian life in the sense thatit will but it will work by some kind of
 natural selection the non-random survival of non of Rannthe regenerated codes it doesn't mean it
 that the genera have to have some kind of genetics but it doesn't have to beDNA genetics probably wouldn't be
 actually but it would I think it would have to be Darwinian yes there's some

0:04:56
Speaker 1 :

0:04:58
Speaker 0 :kind of selection process yes in the
 general sense it will be Darwinian so

0:05:02
Speaker 1 :let me ask kind of artificial
 intelligence engineering questions so you've been an outspoken critic of Iguess what could be called intelligent
 design which is an attempt to describe the creation of a human mind a body bysome religious folks that really just
 folks used to describe so broadly speaking evolution is as far as I knowagain you can correct me is the only
 scientific theory we have for the development of intelligent life likethere's no alternative theory as far as


0:05:31
Speaker 0 :as far as I understand none has ever
 been suggested and I suspect it never will be

0:05:38
Speaker 1 :well of course one of the somebody says


0:05:42
Speaker 0 :that a hundred years later I know but um
 that I mean not what he would look sorry

0:05:48
Speaker 1 :yes they would probably look very
 similar but it'd be it's almost like Einstein's general relativity versusNewtonian physics it'll be maybe an
 alteration of the theory or something like that but it won't be fundamentallydifferent but okay it so so now for the
 past 70 years even before the a a committee has been trying to engineerintelligence in a sense to do what
 intelligent design says the you know was done here on earth what's your intuitiondo you think it's possible to build
 intelligence to build computers that are intelligent or do we need to dosomething like the evolutionary process
 like there's there's no shortcuts here

0:06:32
Speaker 0 :that's an interesting question
 i I'm committed to the belief that is ultimately possible because I thinkthere's nothing normal in our brains I
 think how our brains work by by the laws of physics and so it must in principleit be possible to replicate that in
 practice though it might be very difficult and as you suggest it might itmay be the only way to do it is by
 something like an evolutionary process I'd be surprised I suspect that it willcome but it's certainly been slower
 incoming than some of the early pioneers

0:07:05
Speaker 1 :I thought I thought it would be yeah but
 in your sense is the evolutionary process efficient so you can see it asexceptionally wasteful in one
 perspective but at the same time maybe that is the only path it's a paradox

0:07:16
Speaker 0 :isn't it I mean on the one side it is
 deplorable it wasteful yeah it's fundamentally based on waste on theother hand it does produce magnificent
 results when the the the design of a soaring bird an albatross has David anda vulture an eagle is superb an engineer
 would be proud to have done it on the other hand an engineer would not beproud to have done some of the other
 things that evolution has served up some of the sort of botched jobs that you caneasily understand because of their
 historical origins but they don't look well designed your examples well bad

0:07:53
Speaker 1 :

0:07:55
Speaker 0 :design my favorite example is there a
 current laryngeal nerve I've used this many times this is a nerve it's one ofthe cranial nerves it goes from the
 brain and the end organ is that it supplies is the Voiceboxtheme the larynx but it doesn't go
 straight to the layers it goes right in done to the chest and then loops aroundan artery in the chest and then come
 straight back up again to the larynx and I've assisted in the dissection of agiraffe's neck which happened to have
 died in a zoo and we watched the we saw the recurrent laryngeal nerve goingwhizzing straight past the larynx within
 an inch of the larynx down into the chest and then back up again which is adetour of many feet very very
 inefficient the reason is historical the ancestors are fish ancestors theancestors of all mammals and fish the
 most direct pathway of that of the equivalent of that nerve there wasn'tthe larynx in those days but it did
 innovated part of the gills the most direct pathway was behind that arteryand then when the mammal when the
 tetrapods were in the land vertebra started ever evolving and then the nextstarted to stretch the marginal cost
 of changing the embryo logical design to jump that nerve over the artery was toogreat a rather was was each step of the
 way was of was a very small cost but the marginal but the cost of actuallyjumping it over would have been very
 large as the neck lengthened it was a negligible change to just increase thelength the length of the detour tiny bit
 a tiny bit a tiny bit each millimeter time didn't make any differenceand so but finally when you get towards
 araf it's a huge detour and no doubt is very inefficient now that's bad designany engineer would reject that piece of
 jade design is ridiculous and there are quite a number of examples as you'dexpect it's not surprising that we find
 examples of that sort in a way what's surprising is there aren't more of themin a way what's surprising is that the
 design of living things is so good so natural selection manages to achieveexcellent results partly by tinkering
 partly by coming along and cleaning up initial mistakes and in as it weremaking the best of a bad job that's an


0:10:13
Speaker 1 :interesting I mean it's it is surprising
 and beautiful and it's a it's a mystery from an engineering perspective that somany things are well designed I suppose
 the thing we're forgetting is how many generations have to die oh yeah for

0:10:29
Speaker 0 :that's the inefficiency of it yes that's
 the horrible wastefulness of it so yeah

0:10:33
Speaker 1 :we we marvel at the final product but
 yeah the process is painful he almost describes human beings aspotentially the well he calls the
 biological bootloader for artificial intelligence or artificial generalintelligence is used as the term is kind
 of like super intelligence do you see super human level intelligence that'spotentially the next step in the


0:10:58
Speaker 0 :evolutionary process yes I think that if
 superhuman intelligence is to be found it will be artificial I don't have anyhope that we ourselves our brains will
 go on in go on getting larger in ordinary biological evolution I thinkthat's probably coming to an end it is
 the dominant trend or one of the dominant trends in our fossil historyfor the last two or three million years
 raised eyes yes so it's been it's been swelling ratherdramatically over the last two or three
 million years that is unlikely to continue that the only way that that'sthat happens is because natural
 selection favors those individuals with the biggest brains and that's not

0:11:41
Speaker 1 :happening anymore right there so in
 general in humans the the selection pressures are not I mean are they active

0:11:49
Speaker 0 :in any form well in order for them to be
 active it would be necessary that the most intelligent intelligence not thatintelligence is simply correlation with
 brain size but let's let's talk about intelligence in order for that to evolveit's necessary that the most intelligent
 beings have the most individuals have the most children and so intelligencemay buy you money it may buy you worldly
 success it may buy you a nice house and a nice car and things like that if yousuccessful career it may buy you the
 admiration of your fellow people but it doesn't increase the number of offspringthat you have it doesn't increase your
 genetic legacy to the next generation well on the other hand artificialintelligence I mean computers and
 technology generally is evolving by a non genetic means by leaps and bounds of

0:12:47
Speaker 1 :course and so what do you think I don't
 know if you're familiar there's a company called neural link but there's ageneral effort of brain computer
 interfaces which is to try to build a connection between the computer and thebrains with their scent signals both
 directions and the long-term dream there is to do exactly that which is expandI guess expand the size of the brain
 expand the capabilities of the brain do you do you see this is interesting anddo you see this is the promising
 possible technology or is the interface you see in the computer in the brainlike the brain is this wet messy thing
 that's just impossible to interface with

0:13:23
Speaker 0 :well of course it's interesting whether
 it's promising I'm really not qualified to say what I do find puzzling is thatthe brain being as small as it is
 compared to a computer Andy the individual components being as slowas they are compared to our electronic
 components it is astonishing or it can do I meanimagine building a computer that that
 fits into the size of a human skull and with the equivalent of transistors orintegrated circuits which work as slowly
 as neurons do it something mysterious about that something something must begoing on that we don't understand so I


0:14:08
Speaker 1 :have I just talked to Roger Penrose I'm
 not sure he's familiar with this work and he also describes this kind ofmystery in in the mind in the brain that
 is receives a materialist so there's not there's no sort of mystical thing goingon but there's so much about the
 material of the brain that we don't understand at the that might be quantummechanical nature so on so they're the
 ideas about consciousness do you have any have you ever thought about do youever think about ideas of consciousness
 or a little bit more about the mystery of intelligence and consciousness thatseems to pop up just like you're saying


0:14:47
Speaker 0 :from our brain I agree with Roger
 Penrose that there's a mystery there I I even he's one of the world's greatestphysicists III can't possibly argue with


0:14:59
Speaker 1 :his but nobody knows anything about
 consciousness and in fact you know if we talk about religion and so on some ofthe mystery of consciousness is so
 awe-inspiring and we know so little about it that the leap to sort ofreligious or mystical explanations is


0:15:18
Speaker 0 :too easy to make i I think that it's
 just an act of cowardice to lead to religious explanations and what itdoesn't do that of course but I I accept
 that there may be something we don't understand about it so correct me if I'm

0:15:31
Speaker 1 :wrong but in your book Selfish Gene the
 the gene-centred view of evolution Allah allows us to think of the physicalorganisms as just the medium through
 which the software of our genetics and the ideas sort of propagate so maybe canwe start
 just with a little basics what in this context as the word meme mean it would

0:15:55
Speaker 0 :mean the cultural equivalent of a gene
 cultural equivalent in the sense of that which plays the same role as the gene inthe transmission of culture and the
 transmission of ideas in the broadest sense and it's only a useful word ifthere's something Darwinian going on
 obviously culture is transmitted but is there anything Darwinian going on and ifthere is that means there has to be
 something like a gene which it which becomes more numerous or less numerous

0:16:27
Speaker 1 :in the population so it can replicate it


0:16:29
Speaker 0 :can replicate well it clearly does
 replicate there's no question about that the question is does it replicate in asort of differential way in a Darwinian
 fashion could you say that certain ideas propagate because they're successful inthe meme pool and it's not a trivial
 sense you can would you wish to say though that in the same way as a animalbody is modified adapted to serve as a
 machine for propagating genes is it also machined for propagating memes could youactually say that something about the
 way a human is is is modified adapted for the function of beam propagation

0:17:12
Speaker 1 :there are such a fascinating possibility
 if that's true if the that it's not just about the genes which seems somehow morecome from comprehensible so that these
 things of biology the the the the idea that culture or maybe ideas you canreally broadly define it yes operations


0:17:31
Speaker 0 :of these mechanism II it does does
 evolve by pneumatic means I mean things like hairstyles styles of makeupcircumcision these things are actual
 changes in the body form yes which are non genetic and which getpassed on from generation to generation
 or sideways like a virus um in in a quasi genetic way but the moment you

0:17:59
Speaker 1 :start drifting away from the physical a
 big interesting is a space of ideasideologies political system of course
 yes so what's what in your what's your sense is our memes are metaphor more orthey really is there something
 fundamental almost physical presence of memes well I think they're a bit more

0:18:24
Speaker 0 :than a metaphor and and I think that um
 and I mentioned that physical bodily characteristics which are a bit trivialin a way but when things like the
 propagation of religious ideas both longitudinally down generations andtransversely as in a sort of
 Epidemiology of ideas when of charismatic preacher converts peoplethat that's that resembles viral
 transmission whereas the the longitudinal transmission fromgrandparent to parent a child etc is is
 more like conventional genetic

0:19:06
Speaker 1 :transmission this is such a beautiful
 expression especially in the modern day idea do you think about this implicationsocial networks where the propagation of
 ideas the viral propagation of ideas enhancing the new use of the word meme

0:19:21
Speaker 0 :the describe the the the Internet of
 course provides extremely rapid method of travel ambition and before when Ifirst coined the word the internet
 didn't exist and so I was thinking that in terms of books newspapers broaderradio television and that kind of thing
 now an idea can just leap around the world in in all directions instantly andso the Internet provides a step change
 in the facility of propagation of memes

0:19:55
Speaker 1 :how does that make you feel isn't it
 fascinating that sort of ideas it's like you haven't go up against islands orsomething is the 70s and the internet
 allowed all these species is just like global eyes and and in a matter ofseconds you could spread a message to
 millions of people and these ideas these memes can breedcan evolve can mutate and there's a
 selection and there's like different I guess groups that of all like there's adynamics it's fascinating here do you
 think yes basically do you think your work in this direction whilefundamentally was focused on life on
 Earth do you think it should continue

0:20:37
Speaker 0 :like to be well yeah I do think it would
 probably be a good idea to think in a Darwinian way about this sort of thingwe could mention you think of the
 transmission of ideas from in evolutionary context just being limitedto I mean in our ancestors people living
 in villages living in small bands where everybody knew each other and ideascould propagate within the village and
 they might hop to a neighboring village occasionally and maybe able to aneighboring continent eventually and
 that was a slow process nowadays villages are international I mean youhave people it's been called echo
 chambers where people are in a sort of Internet village where the other membersof the village may be geographically
 distributed all over the world whether they just happen to be interested in thesame things use the same terminology
 the same jargon have the same enthusiasm so people like the Flat Earth Societythey don't all live in one place they
 find each other and they talk the same language to each other they talk thesame nonsense to each other
 and they but so this is a kind of distributed version of the primitiveidea of of people living in in villages
 and propagating their ideas in in a

0:21:58
Speaker 1 :local way is there is there a Darwinist
 parallel parallel here so is their evolutionary purpose of villages or isthat just the I wouldn't use the word


0:22:07
Speaker 0 :like evolutionary purpose in that play
 at that case but vient villages or religious will be something that justemerged that's the way people happen to


0:22:15
Speaker 1 :live and in it just the same kind of way
 the Flat Earth Society societies of ideas emerge in the same kind of way in

0:22:25
Speaker 0 :this digital space yes yes is there


0:22:28
Speaker 1 :something interesting to say about the
 I guess from a perspective of Darwin could we fully interpret the dynamics ofsocial interaction and these social
 networks or is there or some much more complicated thing need to be developed

0:22:48
Speaker 0 :like what's your sense well a Darwinian
 selection idea would involve investigating which ideas spread inwhich which don't so in some ideas don't
 have the ability to spread in the flat earth flatter earth ism is is there area few people believe in it but it's not
 going to spread because it's obvious nonsense but other ideas even if theyare wrong can spread because they are
 attractive in some sense so the the

0:23:16
Speaker 1 :spreading in the selection and in the
 Darwinian context is it just has to be attractive in some sense like we don'thave to define like it doesn't have to
 be attractive in the way that animals attract each otherit could be attractive and some other


0:23:32
Speaker 0 :one yes it's it's all that matters is
 all it's needed easily to spread and it doesn't have to be true to spreadincreases one criterion which might help
 an idea to spread but there are other criteria which might help it to spreadas you say attraction in animals is not
 necessarily available for survival the celebrated of the famous Peacocks taildoesn't help the peacock to survive it
 helps it to pass on its genes similarly an idea which is actually rubbish butwhich people don't know is robbed we
 shouldn't think is very attractive will spread in the same way as a peacocksgene spread it's a small sidestep I


0:24:10
Speaker 1 :remember reading somewhere I think
 recently that in some species of birds sort of the idea that beauty may haveits own purpose and the idea that some
 some birds I'm being in eloquent here but there is some aspects of theirfeathers and so on that serve no
 evolutionary purpose whatsoever there's somebody making an argument that thereare some things about beauty that
 animals do that may be its own purpose thatdoes that ring a bell for you it sound


0:24:46
Speaker 0 :ridiculous he's rather distorted Bell
 okay Darwin when he coined the phrase sexual selection yes didn't feel theneed to suggest that what was attractive
 to females usually as males attracting females the what females foundattractive had to be useful he said it
 didn't have to be useful it was enough that females found it attractive and soit could be completely useless probably
 was completely useless in the conventional sense but was not at alluseless in the sense of passing on don't
 augment in column genes but essentially reproducing others starting with Wallacethe co-discoverer of natural selection
 didn't like that idea and they wanted sexually selected characteristics likepeacock tails to be in some sense useful
 it's a bit of a stretch to think of a peacock say was being useful but in thein the in the sense of survival but
 others have run with that idea and have brought it up to date and so there's akind of there are two schools of thought
 on sexual selection which are still active and about equally supported nowthose who follow Darwin in thinking that
 is just enough to say it's attractive and those who follow Wallace and saythat it has to be in some sense useful


0:26:08
Speaker 1 :do you fall into one category or the
 other no I mean you're into minded I

0:26:11
Speaker 0 :think they both could be correct in
 different cases well I mean they've both been made sophisticated in amathematical sense more so than when
 Darwin and Wallace first started talking about it

0:26:22
Speaker 1 :I'm Russian I read a romanticized thing
 so I prefer the former yes with it or the beauty in itself as a powerful sothe attraction is a powerful force in
 evolution on religion do you think there will ever be a time in our future wherealmost nobody believes in God or God is
 not a part of the moral fabric of our

0:26:49
Speaker 0 :society yes I do I think it may happen
 I'll for very long time it may take a long time for that to happen so do you

0:26:56
Speaker 1 :think ultimately for everybody
 on earth religion the other forms of doctrines ideas could do better job thanwhat religion does yes


0:27:07
Speaker 0 :I mean following in truth at least what


0:27:13
Speaker 1 :truth is a funny funny word and reason


0:27:18
Speaker 0 :to theirs yeah it's a it's a difficult


0:27:19
Speaker 1 :idea
 now with truth on the Internet right and fake news and so on I suppose when yousay reason you mean the very basic sort
 of inarguable conclusions of science versus which political system is better

0:27:38
Speaker 0 :yeah yes yes I mean truth about the real
 world which is ascertainable by not just by the more rigorous methods of sciencebut by just ordinary sensory observation


0:27:52
Speaker 1 :so do you think there will ever be a
 time when we move past it like I guess another way to ask it are we hopelesslyfundamentally tied to religion in the
 way our society functions well clearly

0:28:08
Speaker 0 :all individuals are not hopelessly tied
 to it because many individuals don't believe you could mean something likesociety needs religion in order to
 function properly or something like that and some people have suggested that some

0:28:24
Speaker 1 :

0:28:25
Speaker 0 :what's your intuition on there well I've
 read books on it and they're persuasive I don't think they're that persuasivethough I mean I've some people suggested
 that society needs a sort of figurehead which can be a non-existent figureheadin order to function properly I know
 there's something rather patronizing about the idea that well you and I areintelligent enough not to believe in God
 but the plebs needed sort of thing and I think that's patronizing and I'd like tothink that that that was not the right
 way to proceed but at the individual

0:29:01
Speaker 1 :level do you think there's some value of


0:29:05
Speaker 0 :

0:29:06
Speaker 1 :spirituality sort of if I think
 as a scientist the amount of things we actually know about our universe is atiny tiny tiny percentage of what we
 could possibly know so just from everything even the certainty we haveabout the laws of physics it seems to be
 that there's yet a huge amount to discover and therefore we're sittingwhere 99.999% of things is just still
 shrouded in mystery do you think there's a role in a kind of spiritual view ofthat sort of a humbled spiritual I think


0:29:39
Speaker 0 :it's right to be humble
 I think it's right to admit that there's a lot we don't know a lot that we don'tunderstand a lot but we still need to
 work on we're working on it what I don't think is that it helps to invokesupernatural explanations what we found
 if our current scientific explanations aren't adequate to do the job then weneed better ones we need to work more
 and of course the history of science shows just that that as science goes onproblems get solved one after another
 and the science advances as science gets better but to invoke an non-scientificnon-physical explanation is simply to
 lie down in a cowardly way and say we can't solve it so again to invoke magicdon't let's do that let's say we need
 better science we need more science it may be that the science will never do itit may be that we will never actually
 understand everything and that's okay but let's keep working on it a

0:30:39
Speaker 1 :challenging question there is do you
 think science can lead us astray in terms of the humbleness so there's someaspect of science
 maybe it's the aspect of scientists in that science but of sort of a mix of egoand confidence that can lead us astray
 in terms of discovering them you know some of the big open questions about yesabout the universe I think that's right


0:31:04
Speaker 0 :I mean there are there are arrogant
 people in any walk of life and scientists an exception to that and sothere are arrogant scientists who think
 we've sold everything of course we haven't so humility is a proper stancefor a scientist and when it's a proper
 working stance because it encourages further work but in a way to resort to asupernatural explanation is a kind of
 arrogance because it's saying well we don't understand it scientificallytherefore the non-scientific religious
 supernatural explanation must be the right one that's arrogant what is whatis humble is to say we don't know and we
 need to work further on it so maybe if I could psychoanalyze you

0:31:47
Speaker 1 :for a second you have at times been just
 slightly frustrated with people who have supernet you know have a supernaturalhas that changed over the years have you
 become like how do people that kind of have to seek supernatural explanationshow do you see those people as human
 beings as it's like do you see them as dishonest do you see them as sort ofignorant do you see them as I don't know
 is it like well I mean how do you think

0:32:22
Speaker 0 :of certainly not not not dishonest and I
 mean obviously many of them are very nice people so I don't I don't sort ofdespise them in that sense I think it's
 often a misunderstanding that that people will jump from the admission thatwe don't understand something they will
 jump straight to what they think of as an alternative explanation which is thesupernatural one which is not an
 alternative it's a known explanation instead of jumping to the conclusionthat science needs more work that we
 need to actually get do some better better science so I I don't have I meanpersonal antipathy towards such people I
 just think they're they're misguided so

0:33:10
Speaker 1 :what about this really interesting space
 that I have trouble with so religion ever but a grasp on but there's a largecommunities like you said flat earth a
 community that I've recently because I've made a few jokes about it I sawthat there's I've noticed that there's
 people that to take it quite seriously so there's this bigger world ofconspiracy theorists
 which is the kind of I mean there's elements of it there are religious aswell but I think they're also scientific
 so the the basic credo of a conspiracy theorist is to question everything whichis also the cradle of a good scientist I
 would say so what do you make of this I

0:33:58
Speaker 0 :mean I think it's probably too easy to
 say that by labeling something conspiracy you therefore dismiss it Imean occasionally conspiracies are right
 and so we shouldn't dismiss conspiracy theories out of hand we should examinethem on their own merits Flat Earth is
 amiss obvious nonsense we don't have to examine that much further but I meanthere may be other conspiracy theories
 which are actually right so I've go a

0:34:27
Speaker 1 :grew up in the Soviet Union as I you
 know the space race was very influential for me and both sides of the coin youknow there's a conspiracy theory that we


0:34:40
Speaker 0 :never went to the moon right and it's


0:34:42
Speaker 1 :it's like I can understand it and it's
 very difficult to rigorously scientifically show one way or the otherit's just you have to use some of the
 human intuition about who would have to lie who would have to work together andit's clear that very unlikely good
 behind that is my general intuition that most people in this world are good youknow in order to really put together
 some conspiracy theories there has to be a large number of people workingtogether and essentially being dishonest


0:35:12
Speaker 0 :yes which is improbable it the sheer
 number who would have to be in on this conspiracy and the sheer detail theattention to detail they'd have had to
 have had and so on I'd also can worry about the motive and why would anyonewant to suggest that it but it didn't
 happen what's the what's the why is it so hard to believe I mean the thephysics of it the mathematics of it the
 the idea of computing orbits and trajectories and things it all worksmathematically well I like wouldn't you
 believe it it's a psychology question because

0:35:45
Speaker 1 :there's something really Pleasant about
 you know pointing out that the emperor has no clothes when everybody like youknow thinking outside the box and coming
 up with the chewy answer where everybody else is deluded there's something yeah Imean I have that for science right you
 want to prove the entire scientific community wrong that's the whole now

0:36:06
Speaker 0 :that that's that's right and of course
 historically loan geniuses have come out right sometimes yes but often peoplewith who think they're alone genius and
 from much more often turn out not to so you have to judge each case on itsmerits then the mere fact that you're a
 maverick the mere fact that you you you're going against the current tidedoesn't make you right you've got a FRU
 show you're right by looking at the evidence

0:36:30
Speaker 1 :so because you focus so much on religion
 and disassembled a lot of ideas there and I just I was wondering if you haveideas about conspiracy theory groups
 because there's such a prevalent even reaching into presidential politics andso on it seems like it's a very large
 communities that believe different kinds of conspiracy theories is there someconnection there to your thinking on
 religion and here is it's a matter it's

0:36:55
Speaker 0 :an obviously difficult thing IIIi don't
 understand why people believe things that are clearly nonsense like well FlatEarth and also the conspiracy about not
 landing on the moon or that the that the United States engineer 9/11 that thatkind of thing so it's not clearly


0:37:17
Speaker 1 :nonsense it's extremely unlikely though


0:37:20
Speaker 0 :a it's extremely unlikely the religion
 is a bit different because it's passed down from generation to generation andso many of the people who are religious
 got it from their parents who got it from their parents got it from theirparents and childhood indoctrination is
 a very powerful force but these things like the 9/11 conspiracy theory theKennedy assassination conspiracy theory
 the man on the moon conspiracy theory these are not childhood indoctrinationthese are presumably dreamed up by
 somebody who then tells somebody else who then wants to believe it and I don'tknow why people
 so eager to fall in line with some just some person that they happen to read ormeet who spin some yarn I can kind of
 understand why they believe what their parents and teachers told them when theywere very tiny and not capable of
 critical thinking for themselves so I sort of get why the great religions ofthe world like Catholicism and Islam go
 on for as persisting is because of childhood indoctrination but that's nottrue of Flat Earth ISM and sure enough
 flat earth ISM is a very minority cult

0:38:37
Speaker 1 :way larger than I ever realized well yes
 I know but so that's a really clean idea you've articulate in your new book andand and I'll groan God and then God
 Delusion is the early indoctrination that'sreally interesting you can get away with
 a lot of out there ideas in terms of religious texts if the age which youconvey those ideas at first is a young
 age so indoctrination is sort of an essential element of propagation ofreligion so let me ask on the morality
 side in the books that I mentioned God Delusion I'll go on God you describe thehuman beings don't need religion to be
 moral so from an engineering perspective we want to engineer morality into AIsystems so in general where do you think
 morals come from in humans a very

0:39:30
Speaker 0 :complicated and interesting question
 it's clear to me that the moral standards the moral values of ourcivilization changes as the decades go
 by certainly as the centuries go by even as the decades go by and we in the 21stcentury are quite clearly labeled 21st
 century people in terms of our moral values we there's a spread I mean someof us are a little bit more ruthless
 somewhat more conservative some of us more more liberal and so on but we allsubscribe to pretty much the same views
 when you compare with say 18th century 17th centurypeople even 19th century 20th century
 people so we're much less racist or a much less sexist and so on than we usedto be some some people are still racist
 in some are still sexist but the the spread has shifted that the Gaussiandistribution has moved and moves
 steadily as the centuries go by and that is the most powerful influence I can seeon our moral values and that doesn't
 have anything to do with religion I mean the religion of the these are the moralsof the Old Testament Bronze Age models
 morals they're deplorable and they are to be understood in termsof the people in in the desert who made
 them up at the time and so human sacrifice an eye for an eye a tooth fora tooth petty revenge killing people for
 breaking the Sabbath all that kind of thinginconceivable No so at some point


0:41:24
Speaker 1 :religious texts may have in part
 reflected that Gaussian distribution at that time I did I'm sure they always

0:41:31
Speaker 0 :

0:41:31
Speaker 1 :reflect that yes and then now but the
 the sort of almost like the meme as you describe it of ideas most much fasterthan religious annual is yes so basing


0:41:42
Speaker 0 :your morals on on religious texts which
 were written millennia ago um it is not a great way to proceed I think that'spretty clear so not only should we not
 get our morals from such text but we don't we quite clearly don't um if wedid then we would be discriminating
 against women and we'd be we'd be racist we'd be killing homosexuals and so on soso we don't and we shouldn't now of
 course it's possible to buy the to use the 21st century standards of moralityand you can look at the Bible and you
 can cherry-pick particular verses which conform to our modern morality andyou'll find that Jesus has a pretty nice
 thing which is great but you're using your21st century morality to decide which
 verses to pick which verses to reject and so why not cut out the middleman ofthe Bible and go straight to the 21st
 century morality which is where that comes from is a much more complicatedquestion why is it that morality moral
 values change as the centuries go by they undoubtedly do and is a veryinteresting question to ask why it's
 another example of cultural evolution just as technology progresses so moralvalues progress for probably very
 different reasons but it's a it's

0:43:11
Speaker 1 :interesting if the direction in which
 that progress is happening has some evolutionary value or if it's merely adrift that can go into any direction no


0:43:19
Speaker 0 :choice any direction and I'm not sure
 evolutionarily valuable what it is is progressive in the sense that each stepis a step in the same direction as the
 previous step so it becomes more gentle more decent as by modern standards moreliberal less violent see but more decent


0:43:39
Speaker 1 :I think you're using terms and
 interpreting everything in the context of the 21st centuryyeah because Genghis Khan will probably
 say that this is not more decent because we're now you know there's a lot of weakmembers of society we're not murdering


0:43:52
Speaker 0 :yes I was careful to say bye-bye the
 stands the 21st century by up by our standards if we with hindsight look backat history what we see is a trend in the
 direction towards us towards our present right a present value for us we see

0:44:07
Speaker 1 :progress but it's it's an open question
 whether that won't you know I don't see necessarily why we can never return toGenghis Khan test we could I suspect we


0:44:17
Speaker 0 :weren't but it but if you look at the
 history of moral values over the centuries it is in a progressive I usethe word progressive not in a value
 judgment sense in the sense of of a transitive sense each step is the samein the same direction of the previous
 step so things like we don't derive entertainment fortorturing cats we don't drive
 entertainment from from like the Romans did in the Coliseum from from that state

0:44:52
Speaker 1 :rather or rather we suppress the desire
 to get I mean to have play it's probably in us somewhere so there's a bunch ofparts of our brain one that probably you
 know limbic system that wants certain pleasures and that's this I didn't I

0:45:08
Speaker 0 :mean I I wouldn't have said that but
 your Liberty to think that like well

0:45:14
Speaker 1 :there's a there's a den Carlin of
 hardcore history there's a really nice explanation of how we've enjoyedwatching the torture of people the
 fighting of people just the torture the suffering of people throughout historyas entertainment until quite recently
 and now everything we do with sports or kind of channeling that feeling intosomething else so I mean there's some
 dark aspects of human nature there are underneath everything and I do hope thislike higher level software we've built
 will keep us at bay yes I'm also Jewish and have history with the Soviet Unionin the Holocaust and I clearly remember
 that some of the darker aspects of human nature creeped out there they do that

0:45:59
Speaker 0 :there have been they have been steps
 back was 200 admittedly and and the Holocaust is obvious one but if you takea broad view of history it's it's in the


0:46:10
Speaker 1 :same direction so Pamela McCord ik in
 machines who think has written that AI began with the ancient wish to forge thegods do you see it's it's a poetic
 description I suppose but DC connection between our civilizations historicdesire to create gods to create
 religions and our modern desire to create technology in intelligenttechnology I suppose there's a link


0:46:36
Speaker 0 :between an ancient desire explain away
 mystery and and science but what elegance artificial intelligencecreating gods creating new gods and I
 forget I read somewhere somewhat facetious somepaper which said that we have a new
 goddess called Google and and we pray to it and we worship it and we ask itsadvice like an Oracle and so on that's
 fun and we you don't see that you see that

0:47:09
Speaker 1 :as a fun statement of a seizure
 statement you don't see that as a kind of truth of us creating things that aremore powerful than ourselves and


0:47:18
Speaker 0 :naturally it has a kind of poetic
 resonance to it which I get but I wouldn't but now I wouldn't havebothered to make the point myself put it
 that way all right so you don't think AI will

0:47:30
Speaker 1 :become our new got a new religion and
 you gods a Google well yes I mean like I

0:47:35
Speaker 0 :can see that the future of intelligent
 machines or indeed intelligent aliens from outer space might yield beings thatwe would regard as gods in the sense
 that they are so superior to ask that we might as well worship them that's highlypossible I think but I see a very
 fundamental distinction between a God who is simply defined as something veryvery powerful and intelligent on the one
 hand and a God who doesn't need explaining by a progressive step-by-stepprocess let's like evolution or like or
 like engineering design so the difference of suppose we did meet analien from outer space who was mm-hmm
 marvelously magnificently more intelligent than us and we would sort ofworship it and for that reason
 nevertheless it would not be a god in the very important sense that it did notjust happen by to be to be there like
 God is supposed to it must have come about by a gradual step-by-stepincremental progressive process
 presumably like Darwinian evolution is that there's all the difference in theworld between those two intelligence
 design comes into the universe late as a product of a progressive evolutionaryprocess or a progressive engineering
 design process so most of the work is

0:49:07
Speaker 1 :done through this slow-moving exactly


0:49:10
Speaker 0 :exactly yeah yeah it's but there's still


0:49:17
Speaker 1 :this desire to get answers to the why
 question that if we're if the world is a simulation if we're living in asimulation that there's a programmer
 like creature that we can ask questions over then let's put let's pursue the

0:49:31
Speaker 0 :idea that we're living in a simulation
 which is not not totally ridiculous by the way um there we go then you stillneed to explain the programmer the
 programmer had to come into existence by some the even if we're innocent in asimulation the the programmer must have
 evolved or if if he's in a sort of more she or she she she had a meta simulationthen the the meta meta programmer must
 have evolved by a gradual process you can't escape that fundamentally you'vegot to come back to a gradual
 incremental process of explanation to start with there's no shortcuts in this

0:50:14
Speaker 1 :world
 but maybe to linger on that point about the simulation do you think it's aninteresting basically talked to board
 the the heck out of everybody asking this question but whether you live in asimulation do you think first do you
 think we live in a simulation second do you think it's an interesting thoughtexperiment it's certainly an interesting


0:50:38
Speaker 0 :thought experiment i first met it in a
 science fiction novel by daniel gal I called counterfeit world in which it'sall about I mean III our heroes are
 running a gigantic computer which which simulates the world and and somethinggoes wrong and so one of them has to go
 down into the simulated world in order to fix it and then the the the Dynamo ofthe thing the climate so novel is that
 they discover themselves in another simulation at a high level so I wasintrigued by this and I love others of
 Daniel gallows science-fiction novels then it was revived seriously by NickBostrom boss from talking to


0:51:23
Speaker 1 :

0:51:26
Speaker 0 :in an hour okay and he goes further not
 just treated as a science fiction speculation he actually thinks it'spositively likely yeah I mean it's very
 likely actually well he's he makes like

0:51:38
Speaker 1 :a probabilistic argument which you can
 use to come up with very interesting conclusions about the nature of thisuniverse I mean he think he thinks that


0:51:45
Speaker 0 :that that we are in a simulation done by
 it so to speak are descendants of a future that the products but it's stilla product of evolution it's still
 ultimately going to be a product of evolution even though the superintelligent people of the future have
 created our world and you and I are just a simulation in this table is asimulation and so on I don't actually in
 my heart of hearts believe it but that I like his argument well so the

0:52:16
Speaker 1 :interesting thing is that I agree with
 you but the interesting thing to me if I would say if we're living in asimulation that in that simulation to
 make it work you still have to do everything gradually just like you saidthat even though it's program I don't
 think there could be miracles otherwise

0:52:34
Speaker 0 :we'll know I mean the the programmer the
 higher up the upper ones have to have evolved gradually however the simulationthey create could be instantaneous I
 mean it could be switched on and we come into the world with fabricated memoriestrue but what I'm what I'm trying to


0:52:49
Speaker 1 :convey so you're saying the the broader
 statement but I'm saying from an engineering perspective both theprogrammer has to be slowly evolved and
 the simulation because it's like yeah I'm an engineering perspective yeah it

0:53:02
Speaker 0 :takes a long time to write a program no


0:53:06
Speaker 1 :like just I don't think you can create
 the universe in a snap I think you have

0:53:12
Speaker 0 :to grow it ok well that's and that's a
 good point that's an arguable point by the way um II have thought about using the Nick
 Bostrom eye idea to solve the riddle of how wewere talking we were talking earlier
 about why the human brain can achieve so much I thought of this when my thenhundred year old mother was marveling at
 what I could do with it with us Bart phone and and I could you knowKoren look up anything in the
 encyclopedia I could play her music that she liked and so on Jen please it's allleft in that tiny little firm no it's
 it's out there it's in it's in the cloud it's and maybe what most of what we dois in a cloud so maybe if if we're if we
 are a simulation yeah then all the power that we think is in our skull itactually may be like the power that we
 think is in the iPhone but is that actually out there it's an interface to

0:54:07
Speaker 1 :something else yeah I mean that's what
 beautiful including Roger Penrose with Penn psychism that consciousness issomehow a fundamental part of physics
 that it doesn't have to actually all reside inside network but Roger thinks

0:54:19
Speaker 0 :it does reside in in the skull whereas
 I'm suggesting that it doesn't that it's that there's a cloud that'd be a

0:54:28
Speaker 1 :fascinating fascinating notion and a
 small tangent are you familiar with the work of Donald Hoffman I guess maybenothing is named correctly but just to
 forget the name the idea that there's a difference between reality andperception so like we biological
 organisms perceive the world in order for the natural selection process to beable to survive and so on but that
 doesn't mean that our perception actually reflects the fundamentalreality the physical reality or in you


0:55:04
Speaker 0 :well I do think that although it
 reflects the fundamental reality I do believe there is a fundamental reality Ido think that what the perception is
 constructive in the sense that we construct in our minds a model of whatwe're seeing and so and this is really
 the view of people who work on visual illusions like Richard Gregory who pointout other things like an echo cube which
 flipped from a two-dimensional picture of a cube on on on sheet of paper but wesee it as a three-dimensional cube and
 it flips from one orientation to another at regular intervals what's going on isthat the brain is is constructing a cube
 but the sense-data are compatible with twoalternative cubes and so rather than
 stick with one of them it alternates between them I think that's just a amodel for what we do all the time when
 we see a table when we see a person when we see a let me see anything we're usingthe sense data to construct or or make
 use of a preps previously constructed model I noticed this when when I meetsomebody who actually is say a friend of
 mine but I until I kind of realized that that is him he looks different and thenwhen I finally o'clock that it's him
 his features switch like a neck and cube just into the familiar form as it wereI've taken his face out of the filing
 cabinet inside and grafted it onto or used used the sense data to to to you toin to invoke it yeah we do some kind of


0:56:49
Speaker 1 :miraculous compression on this whole
 thing to be able to filter out most of the sense data it makes it make sense ofit that's just a magical thing that we
 do so you've written several many amazing books but let me ask what bookstechnical or fiction of philosophical
 had a big impact on your own life what what books would you recommend peopleconsider reading in their own
 intellectual journey darling of course

0:57:19
Speaker 0 :and the original I've actually ashamed


0:57:24
Speaker 1 :to say I've never read Darwin he's


0:57:30
Speaker 0 :nearly prescient because considering he
 was writing in the middle of the 19th century Michael Uslan said he's workinga hundred years ahead of his time
 everything except genetics is that amazingly right and amazingly far aheadof his time and of course you need to
 read the the up datings that have happened since his time as well and hewould be astonished by well let alone
 Watson and Crick of course but he Brist honest by Mendelian genetics as well and

0:58:04
Speaker 1 :fascinated to see what he thought about
 the he would think about oh I mean yes it

0:58:09
Speaker 0 :would because in many ways it it clears
 up what appeared in his time to be a riddle in the digital nature of geneticsclears up what what was a problem of the
 big problem gosh there's so much that I could think of I can't I can't reallyadvise there so is there something


0:58:29
Speaker 1 :outside sort of more fiction is there
 when you think young was there books it just kind of outside of kind of therealm of science yeah Jim they just kind
 of sparked your yes well actually I have

0:58:41
Speaker 0 :I suppose I could say that I've learned
 some some science from science fiction um I may I meant I mentioned Danielgallo but and that's one example which
 another of his novels called dark universe which is not terribly wellknown but it's a very very nice science
 fiction story it's about a world of Perpetual darkness and we don't we'renot told a beginning the but why these
 people are in darkness they stumble around in some kind of underground worldof caverns and passages using
 echolocation like bats and whales to get around and they've adapted presumably byDarwinian means to survive in perpetual
 total darkness but what's interesting is that their mythology their religion hasechoes of Christianity but is based on
 light and so there's been a fall from a from a paradise world that once existedwhere light reigned supreme and because
 of the sin of mankind light banished them so then they no longer are inlights presence but but light survives
 in the form of mythology and in the form of sayings like their great light ormightier other lights sake don't do that
 and I and I I hear what you mean rather than I see what you don't want you meanso there's some of the same religious


1:00:08
Speaker 1 :elements are present in this other
 totally kind of absurd different form

1:00:14
Speaker 0 :yes there's a wonderful I wouldn't call
 it set up because it's too good-natured for that I mean there were a wonderfulpower
 all about Christianity and the doctrine the theological doctrine of the fall soI find that that kind of science fiction
 immensely stimulating Fred Hoyles the black cloud oh by the way anything byarthur c clarke i find very very
 wonderful - fred horns the black cloud his first science fiction novel where hewell I learned I learned a lot of
 science from that it has it suffers from an obnoxious hero unfortunately butapart from that he couldn't learn a lot
 of science from it another of his novels the a for Andromeda which by the way thethe theme of that is taken up by Carl
 Sagan science fiction novel another wonderful writer Carl Sagan contactwhere the idea is again we will not be
 visited from outer space by physical bodies we will be visited possibly wemight be visited by radio but the the
 radio signals could manipulate us and actually have a concrete influence onthe world if they make us or persuade us
 to build a computer which which runs their software so that they can thentransmit their software by radio and
 then the computer takes over the world and this is the same theme in bothHoyles book and Sagan spoke I presume
 them I don't want to say canoe but halls book probably did and and but it's aclever idea that the that we will never
 be invaded by physical bodies the War of the Worlds of HG Wells will never happenbut we could be invaded by radio signals
 if code coded information which is sort of like DNA and and you know we are weare we are I call them we are survival
 machines of our of our DNA so it has great resonance from for me because Ithink of us I think of bodies physical
 bodies biological bodies as being manipulated byinformation in DNA which has come down
 through generations and in the space of

1:02:37
Speaker 1 :memes it doesn't have to be physical it
 can be transmitted yeah this information

1:02:42
Speaker 0 :

1:02:43
Speaker 1 :yes that's the fascinating possibility
 that from outer space who can be infiltrated by other memes by otherideas and thereby controlled in that way
 let me ask the last the silliest there may be the most important question whatis the meaning of life what gives your
 life fulfillment perfect a weapon is me from a scientific point of view the

1:03:06
Speaker 0 :meaning of life is the propagation of
 DNA but that's not what I feel that's not the meaning of my life so themeaning of my life is something which is
 probably different from yours and different of other peoples but we weeach make our own meaning so we we have
 we set up goals we want to achieve we want to write a book we want to dowhatever it is we do writer quartet we
 want to win a football match and these are these are short-term girls won't mebegin quite long term goals which are
 set up by our brains which have goal seeking machinery built into them butwhat we feel we don't feel motivated by
 the desire to pass on our DNA mostly we have other other girls which can be verymoving very important they could even be
 called as called spiritual in some cases we want to understand the riddle of theuniverse we want to understand
 consciousness if you want to understand how the brain works these are all noblegoals some of them can be noble goals
 anyway and they are a far cry from the fundamental biological girl which is thepropagation of DNA but the machinery
 that enables us to set up these higher-level goals is originallyprogrammed into us by natural selection
 of DNA the propagation of DNA but what

1:04:35
Speaker 1 :do you make of this unfortunate fact
 that we are mortal do you ponder your mortality does it make you sad the

1:04:46
Speaker 0 :I I ponder it it would it makes me sad
 that I shall have to leave and not see what's going to happen next if there'ssomething frightening about mortality
 apart from sort of missing as I've said something more deeply darkly frighteningit's the idea of eternity but eternity
 is only frightening you feel their eternity but before we were bornbillions of years before we were born
 and we were effectively dead before we were born as I think was Mark Twain saidI was dead for billions of years before
 I was born and never suffered the smallest inconvenience that's how isgoing to be afterward after we leave so
 I think of it as really it eternity is a frightening prospect and so the best wayto spend it is under a general
 anesthetic which is what it'll be beautifully put Richard there's a huge

1:05:41
