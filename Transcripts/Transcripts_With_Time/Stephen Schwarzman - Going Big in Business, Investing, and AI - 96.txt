Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 stephen schwartzman ceo and co-founder of blackstone one ofthe world's leading
 investment firms with over 530 billion dollars of assets under managementhe's one of the most successful business
 leaders in history i recommend his recent bookcalled what it takes that tells stories
 and lessons from his personal journey stephen is a philanthropist and one ofthe wealthiest people in the world
 recently signing the giving pledge thereby committing to givethe majority of his wealth to
 philanthropic causes as an example in 2018 he donated 350million dollars to mit
 to help establish its new college of computingthe mission of which promotes
 interdisciplinary big bold research in artificial intelligencefor those of you who know me know that
 mit is near and dear to my heart and always will be it was and is a placewhere i believe
 big bold revolutionary ideas have a home and that is what is needed in artificialintelligence research in the coming
 decades yes there's institutional challenges butalso
 there's power in the passion of individual researchersfrom undergrad to phd from young
 scientists to senior faculty i believe the dream to buildintelligence systems
 burns brighter than ever in the halls of mitthis conversation was recorded recently

 and now here's my conversation with stephen schwartzmanlet's start with the tough question what
 idea do you believe whether grounded in data or an intuitionthat many people you respect disagree


0:04:27
Speaker 0 :with you on well there isn't
 all that much uh anymore since the world's so transparentuh but uh one of the things i i believe
 in and put it in the the book what it takesis
 is if you're going to do something do do something very consequentialdo something that's quite large uh if
 you can that's unique uh because if you operatein that kind of space
 when you're successful it's it's a huge impactuh the prospect of success enables you
 uh to recruit people uh who want to be part of thatand those type of large opportunities
 are pretty easily described and and so not everybody likes tooperate
 uh at scale some people like to do small thingsbecause it uh is is meaningful for them
 emotionally uh and and so occasionally you get adisagreement
 uh on that but those are life choices uh rather than commercial choices that's

0:05:29
Speaker 1 :interesting
 what good and bad comes with going big see we often in america thinkbig is good
 what's the benefit what's the cost in terms of just bigger than business butlife happiness the pursuit of happiness


0:05:48
Speaker 0 :well
 you do things that make you happy it's not mandatedand everybody's different uh and um
 some people um you know if they have talent likeplaying pro football uh you know other
 people just like throwing the ball around uhyou know not even being on a team
 what what's better depends what your objectives are depends what your talentis
 uh you know it depends um you know

0:06:18
Speaker 1 :what what gives you joy so in terms of
 going big is it both for impact on the world andbecause you personally gives you joy


0:06:26
Speaker 0 :well
 it makes it easier to succeed actually because if you catch something forexample that's cyclical
 that's it's a huge uh opportunity then then you usually can find someplace within that huge opportunity where
 you can make it work uh if if if you'reprosecuting a
 a really small thing and and you're wrongyou don't have many places to go so
 you know i've always found that the easy place to beuh and you know the ability where you
 can concentrate uh human resources get people excitedabout doing
 like really impactful big things and you can afford to pay them actuallybecause the bigger thing can generate
 much more in the way of uh of financial resources so so that bringspeople out of talent
 to help you uh and and so all together it's a virtuous circle

0:07:33
Speaker 1 :uh i think how do you know an
 opportunity when you see one in terms of the one youwant to go big on
 is it intuition is it facts is it uh back and forth deliberationwith people you trust what's the process
 is it art is it science well it's

0:07:52
Speaker 0 :pattern recognition
 and how do you get to pattern recognition first you need to understandthe patterns
 and and the changes that are happening and and that'suh that's either uh it's observational
 on some level you can call it data uh or you can just call it listening touh unusual things that people are saying
 that they haven't said before and you know i've alwaystried to describe this it's like seeing
 a piece of white lint on a on a blackdress
 but most people disregard that piece of lintthey just see the dress i always see the
 lint uh and and i'm i'm fascinated byhow did something get someplace it's not
 supposed to be so it doesn't even need to be a bigdiscrepancy
 but if something shouldn't be someplace in in aconstellation of facts that that
 you know sort of made sense in a traditional wayi i've learned that if you focus
 on why some one discordant note is there that's usually a key tosomething important and if you can find
 two of those discordant notes that's usually a straight line to someplace
 and that some place is not where you've been anduh usually when you figure out that
 things are changing or have changed and you describe them which you have tobe able to do because it's not
 uh some odd intuition it's just focusing on facts it's almost like a scientificdiscovery if you will
 when you describe it to other people in the real worldthey tend to do absolutely nothing
 about it and that's because humans are comfortable in their ownreality
 and if there's no particular reason at that momentto shake them out of their reality
 they'll stay in it even if they're ultimately completelywrong
 and i've always been stunned that when i explainwhere we're going what we're doing and
 why almost everyone just says that'sinteresting and they continue doing what
 they're doing and and so um you know i think it'spretty easy to do that
 uh you know but what you need is a huge data set so you know before ai andpeople's focus
 on data you know i've sort of been doing this mostly my whole lifei'm not a scientist i'm not a let alone
 a computer scientist and you know you can just hear whatpeople are saying when somebody says
 something or you observe something that simply doesn't make sense that'swhen you really go to work
 the rest of it's just processing you

0:10:52
Speaker 1 :know
 on a quick tangent pattern recognition is a termoften used throughout the history of ai
 that's the goal of artificial intelligenceis pattern recognition right but there's
 i would say various flavors of that so usually pattern recognition refers tothe process
 of the the we said dress and the lint on the dresspattern recognition is very good at
 identifying the dress as looking at the re the pattern that'salways there that's very common and so
 on you almost refer to a pattern that'slike an what's called outlier detection
 in uh computer science right the the rare thingthe the small thing now
 ai is not often good at that do you just almost philosophicallythe kind of decisions you made in your
 life based scientifically almost on data do youthink ai in the future will be able to
 do is it something that could be put downinto code or is it still deeply human


0:12:01
Speaker 0 :it's tough for me to say since i don't
 have domain knowledge in a.i to know everythingthat could or might occur
 i i know um sort of in my own case that most people don'tsee any of that
 right i i just assumed it was motivationaluh you know um but but
 it's also sort of uh it's hardwiring what what are you wired or programmed uhto be finding
 uh or looking for it's it's not what happens every day that's notinteresting
 frankly i mean that's what people mostly doi do a bunch of that too because you
 know that's what you do in normal life but i've always beencompletely fascinated by the stuff that
 doesn't fit or the other way of thinking about itit's
 it's determining what what people want without them saying ituh that that's a that's a different kind
 of pattern you can see everything they're doingthere's a missing piece
 they don't know what's missing you think it's missinggiven the other facts you know about
 them and you you deliver that and then thatbecomes you know sort of very easy
 uh to to to sell to them to linger on

0:13:33
Speaker 1 :this point a little bit
 you've mentioned that in your family when you were growing up nobody raisedtheir voice
 in anger or otherwise and you said that this allows you to learn to listenand hear some interesting things
 can you elaborate as you have been on that ideawhat do you hear about the world if you
 listen

0:13:53
Speaker 0 :well you you have to listen really
 intensely to understand uh what people are saying as well aswhat people are intending
 because it's not necessarily the same thingand people mostly
 give themselves away no matter how cleverthey think they are particularly
 if you have the full array of inputs in other words if you look at their faceyou look at their eyes
 which are the window on the sole it's very difficultto to conceal which what you're thinking
 uh you look at facial expressions and postureyou listen to their voice which changes
 um you know when it's when you're you're talking aboutsomething you're comfortable with or not
 are you speaking faster is the amplitude of what you're sayinghigher most people just give away what's
 really on their mind uh you know they're they're not thatclever they're busy spending their time
 thinking about what they're in the process of saying and and soif you just observe that not in a
 hostile way but just in an evocative way and justlet them talk for a while
 they'll more or less tell you almost completelywhat they're thinking even the stuff
 they don't want you to know and and once you know thatof course it's sort of easy to play that
 kind of game uh because they've already told youeverything you need to know and
 and and so it's easy to get to uh a conclusion if there's meant to be onean area of common interest
 since you know almost exactly what's on their mindand and so that's an enormous advantage
 as opposed to just walking in in some place and and somebody telling yousomething and you believing what they're
 saying um there are so many different levels ofcommunication


0:16:00
Speaker 1 :so powerful approach to life you discuss
 in the book on the topic of listening and reallyhearing people is
 figuring out what the biggest problem bothering a particular individualgroup is and coming up with a solution
 to that problem and presenting them with the solutionright
 in fact you brilliantly describe a lot ofsimple things that most people just
 don't do it's kind of obvious find the problem that's botheringsomebody deeply
 and as you said i think you've implied that they will usually tell you what theproblem is
 but can you talk about this process of seeing what the biggest problem for aperson is trying to solve it
 and uh maybe a particularly memorable example

0:16:47
Speaker 0 :yeah sure you know if if if you know
 you're going to meet somebody there are two two types of situationschance meetings
 and you know the second is you know you're going to meet somebody solet's take the easiest one which is you
 know you're going to meet somebody and you you start trying tomake pretend you're them it's really
 easy what's on their mind what are theythinking about in their daily life what
 are the big problems they're facing so so ifthey're
 you know to make it a really easy uh exampleum you know make pretend you know
 they're like president of the united statesdoesn't have to be this president it
 could be any president so you sort of knowwhat's more or less on their mind
 because the press keeps reporting it and and you see it on television youhear it
 uh people discuss it so you know if you're going to berunning into somebody in that kind of
 position you sort of know what they look likealready uh
 you know what they sound like you you you knowuh what their voice is like and you know
 what they're focused on and and so if you're going to meetsomebody like that
 what would you what you should do is take the biggest unresolved issuethat they're facing and and come up with
 uh a few interesting solutions that that that basically haven't been out thereuh or that you you haven't heard anybody
 else i was thinking about so just to give youan example it was
 sort of in the early 1990s and i was invited to something at the white housewhich was a big deal for me because
 i was like you know a person from no place and andyou know i had met the president once
 before uh because it was president bush becausehis son
 was in my dormitory so i had met him at parents dayi mean it's just like the oddity of
 things so so i knew i was going to see himbecause you know that's where the
 invitation came from and um so so there was something goingon and i just
 thought about you know two or three ways toapproach that uh that issue and
 you know at that point i was uh separated andso i had brought it it brought a date uh
 to the white house and you know you know and so i saw thepresident and
 we sort of went over in a corner for about 10 minutesand discussed whatever this issue was
 and i i i later you know went back to my datawas a little rude but it was meant to be
 confidential conversation and i barely knew herand um you know she said what were you
 talking about all that time i said well you knowthere's something going on in the world
 and i've thought about different ways of perhaps approachingthat and he was interested
 and the answer is of course he was interested why wouldn't he be interestedthere didn't seem to be an easy outcome
 and and so you know conversations of that type once somebody knows you'rereally thinking
 about what's good for them uh and good for the situationuh it has nothing to do with with me
 i mean it's really about being in serviceuh you know to to to this situation
 that then people trust you and they'll tell you other thingsbecause they know your motives are are
 basically very pure you're just trying to resolve adifficult situation or help somebody do
 it so so these types of things you knowthat's a planned situation that's easy
 is sometimes you just come upon somebody and they start talkingand you know that requires you know like
 different skills you know uh you can ask themwhat you've been working on lately what
 are you thinking about uh you can ask them you know has anythingbeen particularly difficult
 any any you know you can ask most people ifif they trust you for some reason
 um they'll tell you and then you have to instantly go to work on itand um you know that's that's not as
 good as having some advanced planning but butyou know uh
 almost everything going on is is like out there and and people who areinvolved with interesting
 situations um they're playing in in in in the same ecosystem they justhave different roles
 uh in in the ecosystem uh and um you know you you can do that withsomebody who owns a pro football team
 uh that loses all the time we specialize in those in new york and and you knowyou you already have analyzed
 why they're losing right inevitably it's because they don't have a greatquarterback
 they don't have a great coach and they don't have a great general manager whoknows how to hire
 the best talent those are the three reasonswhy a team fails right because they're
 salary caps so every team pays the same amount ofmoney for all their players
 so it's got to be those three positions so if you're talking with somebody likethat
 inevitably even though it's not structuredyou you'll you'll you'll know how their
 team's doing and you'll know pretty much why and if you start askingquestions about that
 they're typically very happy to talk about it because they haven't solvedthat problem
 in some cases they don't even know that's the problem it's pretty easy tosee it
 so you know i do stuff like that which i find is intuitive as a processbut you know leads to really good
 results

0:22:43
Speaker 1 :well the funny thing is when you're
 smart for smart people it's hard to escapetheir own ego
 and in the space of their own problems which is what's requiredto think about other people's problems
 it requires for you to let go of the fact that youryour own problems are all important
 and then to talk about your i think uh while it seems obvious i think quitebrilliant it's a difficult leap for many
 people especially smart people to empathizewith
 truly empathize with the problems of

0:23:20
Speaker 0 :others
 well i have a competitive advantage which is which is i don't think i'm sosmart
 so good so you know it's not a problem for me

0:23:31
Speaker 1 :well the truly smartest people i know
 say that exact same thing yeah being humbleis uh is really useful competitive
 advantage as you said uh how do you stay humble well i

0:23:43
Speaker 0 :i haven't changed much um since since
 since i was um in my mid-teens you know i was raisedpartly in the city and partly in the
 suburbs and um and you know whatever the valuesi had uh at that time uh those are still
 my values uh i call them like middle class valuesthat's how i was raised um
 and um i i've never changed why would i that's who i am andand so the accoutrement of of um
 you know the rest of your life has got to be put onthe same you know like solid foundation
 of who you are because if you start losing who youreally are who are you
 so i've never had the desire to be somebody else i just do other things nowthat i wouldn't do as a you know sort of
 as a middle class kid from philadelphia imean my life has morphed
 uh on a certain level but part of the strengthof having uh integrity of uh
 personality is is that you can remain in touchwith um with with everybody who's
 comes from that kind of background and andyou know even though i do some things
 that aren't like that you know in terms of people i'd meet orsituations i'm in
 i always look at it through the same lens uh and that's very psychologicallyuh comfortable uh and doesn't require me
 to make any real adjustments in my life and ijust keep plowing ahead


0:25:25
Speaker 1 :there's a lot of activity in progress in
 recent years around effective altruism it's i wanted tobring
 this topic with you because it's an interesting one from your perspectiveuh you can put it in any kind of terms
 but it's philanthropy that focuses on maximizing impact how do you see thegoal of philanthropy
 both from a personal motivation perspective and a societal big picture

0:25:52
Speaker 0 :impact perspective yeah i i don't think
 about philanthropy the way you would expect meto
 okay i i look at you know sort of solving big issues addressing big issuesstarting new organizations to do it much
 like we do in our business you know we keep growingour business
 not by taking the original thing and making it largerbut continually seeing new things and
 and and building those and and you know sort of marshalingfinancial resources human resources and
 and in our case because we're in the investment business we find somethingnew that looks like it's going to be
 terrific and and we do that and it works outreally well
 all i do in what you would call philanthropyis is look at other
 opportunities to help society and i end up starting something newmarshalling people
 marshaling a lot of money and and then at the end of thatkind of creative process so somebody
 typically asks me to write a check i i don't wakeup and say how can i
 like give large amounts money away i look atissues that are important for people
 in some cases i do smaller things because it's important to a person uhand and you know i have you know sort of
 like i can relate to that person there's someunfairness uh that's happened to them
 and so uh in situations like that i'd give moneyanonymously and
 help them out and you know that that's that'sit's it's like a miniature version
 of addressing something really big so you know at mitum i i've done a big thing uh
 you know helping to start this new school of computingand and i did that because you know i i
 saw that that you know there's sort of like aglobal race on
 uh in ai quantum and other major technologies and ii thought that um that the u.s could use
 more enhancement from a competitive perspective andi also because i get to china a lot and
 i travel around a lot compared to a regular person um you knowi
 i can see the need to have control of these types of technologies so whenthey're introduced
 we don't create a mess like we did with the internetuh and with social media uh unintended
 consequence um you know that's creating all kinds ofissues and freedom of speech and the
 functioning of liberal democracies so with with ai it was pretty clear thatthere was enormous
 difference of views around the world by therelatively few practitioners in the
 world who really knew what was going on and uh by accident i knew a bunch ofthese people
 uh you know who were like big famous peopleuh and i could talk to them and say why
 do you think this is a force for bad and someone else why do you feel this isa force for good
 and and how do we move forward with the technologybut the same by the same time make sure
 that whatever is potentially you know sort of on the bad side of thistechnology with
 you know for example the disruption of workforces and things like thatthat could hap happen much faster than
 the industrial revolution uh what do we do about that and how dowe keep that
 under control so that the really good things about these technologieswhich will be great things not good
 things uh are allowed to happen so so to meuh you know this this was one of the
 great issues uh facing society the number ofpeople who were aware of it were very
 small i just accidentally got sucked into itand and as soon as i saw it i went
 oh my god this is mega yeah both on a competitive basis globally uhbut but also in terms of protecting uh
 society and benefiting society so so so that'show i got involved and at the end
 you know sort of the right thing that we figured out wasyou know sort of double mit's computer
 science faculty and and and basically create the first aienabled
 uh university in the world uh and you know in effect be an example abeacon to the rest of the research
 community around the world academically and and and create you knowa much
 more robust uh us uh situation competitive situationamong the universities uh because if
 if mit was going to raise a lot of money and double its faculty well you couldbet that
 you know and a number of other universities were going to do the samething at the end of it
 it would be great for knowledge creation you know greatfor the united states great for the
 world uh and so i like to do things that ithink
 are really positive things that other people aren't actingon
 that i i see for whatever the reason firstjust people i meet and what they say and
 i can recognize when something really profound is aboutto happen or needs to
 and i do it at the end of the day the end of the situationsomebody says can you write a a check
 to help us and then the answer is sure i mean because if i don'tthe vision won't happen but it's the
 vision of whatever i do that is compelling

0:31:53
Speaker 1 :and essentially i love that idea of
 whether it's small to individual level or really biglike the the gift to mit to launch
 the college of computing it's it's it starts with a visionand it you see philanthropy
 as um the biggest impact you can have is by launching something newespecially on an issue that others
 aren't really addressing and i and i also love thenotion
 and you're absolutely right that there's other universitiesuh stanford cmu i'm looking at you
 that would essentially your the seed willwill will create other it will have a
 ripple effect that potentially might help us be aleader or continue to be a leader in ai
 this potentially very transformative researchdirection just to linger on that point a
 little bit what is your hope long term for theimpact the college here at mit might
 have in the next 5 10 even 20 or let's getcrazy 30 50 years


0:33:03
Speaker 0 :well it's very difficult to predict the
 future when you're dealing with knowledge productionand creativity um you know mit has
 obviously um some unique aspects uh you know globally and you knowthere's four big uh
 sort of academic surveys um i forget whether it was qsuh there's the times uh in london
 you know the u.s news and whatever but one of these recently mit was rankednumber one
 in the world yeah right so so leave aside whether you're number threesomewhere else
 in the great sweep of humanity this is pretty amazing yeah right so soyou have a
 really um remarkable aggregation of of human talent uh hereand um where it goes uh it's hard to
 tell you have to be a scientist to have the right feel umbut but what's important is you you have
 a critical mass of people and i i think it breaks intotwo buckets
 one is scientific advancement uh and and if the new college can uhhelp you know sort of either serve as a
 convening uh force within the university um oror or help sort of
 coordination and communication among peopleuh that's a good thing um
 absolute good thing the second thing is isin the ai ethics area uh which
 is is is uh in a way equally important becauseif if the science side creates blowback
 uh so so that science is is is um you know uha bit crippled in terms of going forward
 because society's reaction to toknowledge advancement in this field
 becomes really hostile that then you've sort of lost the gamein terms of scientific
 progress and innovation and and so the ai ethics pieceis super important because you know in
 a in a perfect world mit would would serve as a global convenerbecause what you need is is you need
 the research universities you need the companiesthat are driving ai and quantum
 work you need governments who will ultimately beregulating certain elements of this
 uh and you also need the media to be knowledgeable and trainedso so we don't get um sort of um
 overreactions to to one situation which then goes viral uhand it ends up shutting down avenues
 that are perfectly fine you know to to bewalking down or running down that avenue
 uh but but if enough uh discordant uh information not even correctnecessarily
 uh you know sort of gets um uh you know sort of is pushed aroundsociety then you can end up with a
 really hostile regulatory environment and other things so you havefour drivers that that have to be
 um sort of um integrated uh and and so uhif if the new school of computing uh
 can be really helpful in that regard uh then that's a real service uh toscience and it's a service to mit
 so so that's that's why i wanted to get involved

0:37:10
Speaker 1 :for both areas and the hope is for me
 for others for everyone for the world is uh for this particular college ofcommunity to be a beacon
 and a connector for the re for these for these ideas

0:37:22
Speaker 0 :yeah that's right i mean i i think uh
 mit is perfectly uh positioned uhuh to do that so you've mentioned the


0:37:32
Speaker 1 :media
 social media the internet as uh this complex network of communicationwith uh with flaws perhaps perhaps you
 can speak to them but it you know i personallythink that science and technology
 has its flaws but ultimately is uh one sexy excitingit's the way for us to explore and
 understand the mysteries of our world and two most perhaps more importantlyfor some people
 it's a huge way to a really powerful way to grow the economyto improve the quality of life for
 everyone so how do we get how do you see uh the media social mediathe internet
 as a society having uh you know healthy discourse about sciencefirst of all one that's factual and to
 one that finds science exciting that invests inscience
 that pushes it forward especially in thisscience fiction fear-filled field of
 artificial intelligence well i think that's a little above my

0:38:44
Speaker 0 :pay grade because
 um you know trying to control social media to make it do what you want to dosure appears to be beyond almost
 anybody's control and and the technology is beingused
 to create what i call the tyranny of the minoritiesokay a minority is defined as
 you know two or three people on a street corner it doesn't matter what they looklike
 uh it doesn't matter where they came from they're unitedby that one issue that they care about
 and their job is to enforce their views uh on the world and you knowuh in the political world people just
 are manufacturing uh truth uh and and they throw it allover
 and it affects all of us uh and um you know sometimes people are just hiredto
 to do that i mean it's amazing uh and you think it's one person it'sreally you know just sort of a
 front you know for a particular point of viewuh and this has become exceptionally
 disruptive for society and it's dangerousand it's undercutting you know the
 ability of liberal democracies to functionand i don't know how to get a grip on
 this and i was really surprised um when we um it was up here for theannouncement
 uh last uh spring uh of the college of communicomputing
 and they had all these famous scientists some of whom were involved with theinvention
 [Music] of the internet and almost every one ofthem got up and said
 i think i made a mistake uh and as a non-scientist i never thought i'dhear
 anyone say that and and what they said ismore or less to make it simple uh we
 thought this would be really cool uh inventing the internet we couldconnect everyone in the world
 we can move knowledge around it was instantaneousit's a really amazing thing he said i
 don't know that there was anyone who ever thought about socialmedia coming out of that
 and the actual consequences for people's livesuh you know so there's always some um
 some younger person i just saw one of these yesterdayhe's reported on the national news who
 killed himself when people use social media tobasically
 you know sort of ridicule him or something of that typethis is dead um this is dangerous
 uh and um you know so so i i don't have a solution for thatother than going forward
 you can't end up with this type of outcomeusing ai to make this kind of mistake
 twice is unforgivable so so interestingly at least in the westuh and in parts of china uh people are
 quite sympathetic uh to to you know sort of the wholeconcept of
 ai ethics and what gets introduced when and and cooperation within your owncountry
 within your own industry as well as globallyto make sure that the technology is a
 force for good and that really

0:42:24
Speaker 1 :interesting topic since 2007
 you've had a relationship with senior leadershipwith a lot of people in china and
 an interest in understanding modern china their culturetheir world much like with russia i'm
 from russia originally americans are told a verynarrow one-sided story about
 china that i'm sure misses a lot of fascinating complexityboth positive and negative what lessons
 about chinese culture its ideas as a nation asfuture do you think americans should
 know about deliberate on think about

0:43:02
Speaker 0 :well it's it's sort of a wide question
 that you're you're asking about uh you know china isa pretty unusual place you know at first
 it's it's huge uh you know you gotit's physically huge it's got a billion
 three people and the the character of the peopleisn't as well understood
 uh in the united states um chinese um people are amazinglyenergetic uh if if you're one of a
 billion three people one of the things you've got to befocused on is how do you make your way
 uh you know through a crowd uh of a billion 2.99999

0:43:50
Speaker 1 :other people another word for that is


0:43:52
Speaker 0 :competitive yes
 they they are individually highly energetichighly focused always looking for
 some opportunity uh for themselves um because they need to uh becausethere's an enormous amount of just
 literally people around and and so you you know what i've found uhis uh they'll try and find a way to win
 uh for themselves uh and their country is complicatedbecause it it basically doesn't have the
 same kind of functional laws uh that we do uh in in the united statesin the west
 and and um the country is controlled really uh through a web of relationshipsyou have with other people
 uh and the relationships that those other people have with other peopleso it's an incredibly dynamic
 uh uh culture where if somebody knocks somebody up on the top who'sthree levels above you and is in effect
 protecting you then then you know you're you're like a youknow sort of a floating
 molecule there uh you know without tetheringuh except the one or two layers above
 you but that's gonna get affected so it's a very dynamic system andgetting people to change
 is not that easy because if there aren't really functioning lawsit's only the relationships that
 everybody has and so when you decide to make a majorchange
 and you sign up for it something is changing in your life there won'tnecessarily be all the same people on
 your team uh and that's a very high riskenterprise so when you're dealing with
 with china it's important to know almost what everybody's relationship is withsomebody uh
 so when you suggest doing something differentlyyou you line up these forces in the west
 it's usually you talk to a person and they figure out what's good for themuh it's a lot easier and in that sense
 in a funny way it's easier to make change uh in the west just the oppositeof what people think
 but but once the chinese system adjusts to something that's neweverybody's on the team it's hard to
 change them but once they're changed they are incredibly focused in a waythat it's hard for the west to do
 in a more individualistic culture so so there are all kinds of fascinatingthings
 i you know um one thing that might interest uh youknow the people who are listening
 were more technologically based than some other groupum that was with one of the top people
 in the government um a few weeks ago and hewas telling me that
 that every school child in um in china is is going to betaught computer science now imagine
 100 of these children this is such a large number ofhuman beings now that doesn't mean that
 every one of them will be good at computer science but ifit's sort of like
 in the west if it's like math or english everybody's going to take it yes noteverybody's great at
 english they don't write books they don't write poetryand not everybody's good at math you
 know somebody like myself i sort of evolved to the third grade andi'm still doing flash cards
 uh you know i didn't make it further in mathbut imagine everybody in their society
 is going to be involved with computer science

0:47:58
Speaker 1 :i just even pause on that i i think
 the computer science involves at the basic beginner level programmingand the idea
 that everybody in the society would have some ability to program a computeris incredible
 for me it's incredibly exciting and um i think that should giveunited states pause and
 uh consider what talking about sort of philanthropy and launching thingsthere's nothing like launching sort of
 investing in young the youth the education system becausethat's where everything launches


0:48:40
Speaker 0 :yes well we've got a complicated system
 because we have over three thousand school districts aroundthe country
 china doesn't worry about that as a conceptthey make a decision at the very top of
 the the government that that's what theywant to have happen and that is what
 will happen and we're really handicappeduh by this distributed you know power
 uh in the education area although some people involved with that area willthink it's
 uh it's great uh but you know you would know better than ido uh what percent of american children
 have computer science uh uh exposure my guessno knowledge uh would be five percent
 or less uh and if we're going to be going into a worldwhere where the other major economic uh
 power uh sort of like ourselves is is got likea hundred percent
 and we got five and and the whole computer science areauh is the future um then we're
 purposely or accidentally actually handicapping ourselves and our systemdoesn't allow us uh to adjust quickly
 uh to that so you know the issues like thisuh i i find fascinating uh
 and you know if you're lucky enough to go to other countriesuh which i do um and you learn what
 they're thinking then it informs what what we ought to bedoing
 in in in the united states

0:50:22
Speaker 1 :so the current administration donald
 trump has released the an executive order onartificial intelligence
 not sure if you're familiar with it in 2019uh looking several years ahead how does
 america sort of we've mentioned in terms of thebig impact
 we hope your in investment in mit will have a ripple effect but from afederal perspective from a government
 perspective how does america establish with respectto china
 leadership in the world at the top for research and development in ai

0:50:59
Speaker 0 :yeah i i think that you have to get the
 federal government in the game in a big wayand that this leap forward
 technologically which is going to happen with or without us you know reallyshould be with us and and it's an
 opportunity in effect uh for another moonshotuh kind of mobilization uh
 by the united states uh i think uh the appetite uh actually is thereto do that at the moment
 what's getting in the way is the kind of poisonouspolitics we have but but if you
 go below the lack of cooperation which isalmost the defining element of american
 democracy right now in the congress if you talk to individual members theyget it
 and they would like to do something another part of the issue is we'rerunning huge deficits we're running
 trillion dollar plus deficits so how much money do you needfor this initiative
 where does it come from who's prepared to stand up for ituh because if it if it involves taking
 away resources from another area our political system is is not realflexible
 uh to do that uh if you're creating umthis kind of initiative um which we need
 where does the money come from uh and and trying to get moneywhen you've got trillion dollar deficits
 in a way it could be easy what's the difference of a trillion and a trilliona little more
 uh but but you know it's it's hard with the mechanismsof congress but what's um what's really
 important is uh this is not an issueuh that is unknown and
 it's viewed as a very important issue uh and there's almost no one in thecongress when you sit down and explain
 what's going on who doesn't say we we've got to dosomething


0:53:22
Speaker 1 :let me ask the impossible question so if
 you didn't endorse donald trump but after he was electedyou have given him advice


0:53:33
Speaker 0 :

0:53:34
Speaker 1 :which which seems to me a great
 thing to do no matter who the president is to contributepositively contribute to this nation by
 giving advice and yet you've received a lot ofcriticism for this
 so on the previous topic of science and technology and governmenthow do we have a healthy discourse
 give advice get excited uh conversation with the governmentabout science and technology
 without it becoming politicized it's

0:54:09
Speaker 0 :very
 interesting so when i was young before there was a moonshot we had apresident
 named john f kennedy from massachusetts hereand in his inaugural address as
 president uh he has not what your country can dofor you
 uh but what you can do for your country you know we had a generation of peoplemy age basically people who grew up
 uh with that credo and you know sometimes you don't need toinnovate
 you can go back to basic principles and that's a good basic principleuh what can what can we do um
 you know americans have gdp per capita of around 60000 uh you know not every
 it's not equally distributed but it's biguh and you know people have i think
 an obligation uh to help their country and i do thatand apparently i take some
 grief for people from some people you knowwho who who um
 project on me things i don't even vaguely believebut i'm like quite simple
 you know i tried to help the previous presidentpresident obama he was a good guy and he
 was a different party and i tried to help president bush and he's adifferent party
 and you know i i i i sort of don't care that much uh about what the partiesare i care about even though i'm a big
 donor for the republicans but it's it'swhat motivates me is what are the
 problems we're facing and can i help people get toyou know sort of a good outcome that'll
 stand any test uh but we live in a world nowwhere
 you know sort of the filters uh in the hostility isis so unbelievable
 uh you know in the 1960s when i went to schoolin university i went to yale and we had
 like like so much stuff going on uhwe had a war called the vietnam war
 we had you know sort of black power startingand and uh you know we had a sexual
 revolution with the birth control pill uh and um you knowum there was one other major thing going
 on and right the drug revolution[Music]
 there hasn't been a generation that had more stuffgoing on in a four-year period
 than my era yet there wasn't this kind ofinstant hostility if you believed
 something different everybody lived together andand you know respected uh the other
 person and and i think that you know this typeof
 change needs to happen and it's got to happenfrom the leadership of of our major
 institutions and i i don't think that thatleaders can be bullied uh
 by people who are against you know sort of the classical version of free speechand
 letting open expression and inquiry that's what universities are foruh among other things uh socratic
 methods and uh so so i i haveum uh in in the midst of this
 like onslaught uh of oddness uh i i believe instill the basic principles and we're
 going to have to find a way to get back to that and that doesn'tstart
 with the people uh you know sort of in the middle to the bottomwho are using you know these kinds of
 screens to to shout people down and and createan uncooperative environment it's got to
 be done uh at the top with core principlesthat are articulated uh and
 uh ironically um if people don't sign on to these kind of core principleswhere people are equal and
 and you know speech can be heard and you know you don't have these enormousshout down biases subtly or
 or out loud then they don't belong at those institutionsthey're violating the core principles
 and and um you know that that's how you end upmaking change
 uh and but you have to have courageous peopleuh who are willing to lay that out
 for the benefit of not just their institutionsbut for society uh as a whole
 so i i i believe that will happen um but it needs the commitment uhof of of senior people to make it happen


0:59:43
Speaker 1 :courage and i think for such great
 leaders great universities there's a huge hunger for itso i i'm too very optimistic that it
 will come i'm now personally taking a step intobuilding a startup
 first time hoping to change the world of coursethere are thousands maybe more maybe
 millions of other first-time entrepreneurs like mewhat advice you've gone through this
 process you've talked about the sufferingthe emotional turmoil it all might
 entail what advice do you have for those people taking that step

1:00:19
Speaker 0 :i i'd say it's a rough ride
 and you have to be psychologically prepared for things going wrongwith frequency you have to be prepared
 to be put in situations where you're being asked to solve problems you didn'teven know those problems existed
 you know for example renting space it's it's not really a problem unless you'venever done it you have no idea what a
 lease looks like right you don't even know the relevantrent
 and you know in a market so everything is neweverything has to be learned what you
 realize is that it's good to have other peoplewith you
 who've had some experience in areas where you don't know what you're doingunfortunately an entrepreneur starting
 doesn't know much of anything so everything isis something new yeah and um
 i think it's important not to be alone uhbecause it's sort of overwhelming
 uh and you need somebody to talk to uh other than uh a spouse or a loved oneuh because even they get bored with your
 problems uh and and so you know getting a groupyou know if you look at alibaba um you
 know jack ma was telling me they went youknow they basically were
 like a financial death store at least twice uhand you know the fact that there it
 wasn't just jack i mean people think it is because of youknow he became the
 you know the sort of public face and the driverbut but a group of people
 who can give advice share situations to talk about uh that'sreally important


1:02:13
Speaker 1 :and that's not just referring to the
 small details like renting space no it's also the psychological yes

1:02:20
Speaker 0 :burden
 yeah and you know because most entrepreneurs at some pointquestion what they're doing because it's
 not going so well or they're screwing it up and they don't know how tounscrew it up uh because we're all
 learning and it's hard to be learning you knowwhen they're like
 25 variables going on if you you know if you're missing four big ones you canreally make a mess
 uh and so the ability to to in effect have either an outsider uhwho's really smart that you can rely on
 for certain type of things uh or other people who are working withyou on a daily basis
 um it's most people who haven't had experience believe inthe myth
 of the one person one great person you knowmakes outcomes uh creates outcomes that
 are positive most of us it's not like thatif you look back over a lot of the big
 successful tech companies it's not typically oneperson
 it you know it's and you will know these stories better than i douh because it's your world not mine but
 even i know that almost every one of them had twopeople i mean if you look at
 google you know that's what they had and then that was the same with microsoft atthe beginning and
 you know it was the same at apple it you know people have different skillsand and they need to play off of
 uh other people so so um you know the the advice that that iwould give you
 is make sure you understand that so you don'thead off in some direction as a lone
 wolf uh and find that either you can't inventall the solutions
 um or you make bad decisions on certain types of thingsthis is a team sport entrepreneur
 means you're alone in effect and that's the myth but it's mostly amyth


1:04:27
Speaker 1 :yeah i think and you talk about this in
 your book and i could talk to you about it foreverthe the harshly self-critical aspect to
 your personality and uh to mine as well in the face offailure
 it's a powerful tool but it's also a burdenthat's that's very interesting uh
 very interesting to uh walk that line but let me askon the in terms of people around you in
 terms of friends in in the bigger picture of your ownlife where do you put the value of
 love family friendship in the big picture journey of your life

1:05:06
Speaker 0 :well ultimately all journeys are alone
 um it's great to have support um andyou know um when you you you go forward
 and say your job is to make something work andthat's your number one priority
 um and you're going to work at it to make it workyou know it's like super human effort
 people don't come become successful as part-time workersit doesn't work that way and
 if you're prepared to make that 100 to 120uh effort you're gonna you're gonna need
 support and and you're gonna have to peopleinvolved with your life
 who understand that that's really part of your lifeuh sometimes you you're involved with
 somebody and you know they don't really understandthat and that's a source of
 you know sort of conflict and difficulty but if youif you're involved with the right people
 uh you know whether it's a sort of datingrelationship or
 you know sort of you know spousal relationshipum you know you you have to involve them
 uh in your life uh but not burden them with with everyyou know sort of minor triumph or
 mistake they they actually get bored with itafter a while and and so you have to set
 up different types of ecosystems you have your home lifeyou have your love life you have
 children and and that's like the enduring partof what you do and then on the other
 side you've got the you know sort ofunpredictable nature
 uh of um of of of this type of work what i say topeople
 at my firm who are younger usually um well everybody's younger but but um youknow people who are of an age
 where you know they they're just having their first childuh or maybe they have two children that
 it's important um to to make sure they go away uh withtheir spouse
 uh uh at least once every two months it's just some lovely place wherethey're no children
 no issues uh sometimes once a month if if they're you know sort of energeticand clever
 uh and that um escape the craziness of

1:07:50
Speaker 1 :it all


1:07:51
Speaker 0 :yeah and and reaffirm uh
 your your values as a couple uh and you have to have fun if you don'thave fun
 with the person you're with and all you're doing is dealing with issuesthen then that gets pretty old and so
 you have to protect the fun element of your life togetherand the way to do that isn't by hanging
 around the house and and dealing with you know sort ofmore problems
 you have to get away and and reinforce and reinvigorateuh your relationship and whenever i tell
 one of our younger people about that they sort of look at me andit's like the scales are falling off of
 their eyes and they're saying geez you know i hadn't thought aboutthat you know i'm so enmeshed
 in all these things but that's a great idea and that's something as anentrepreneur
 you also have to do you just can't let relationshipsslip because you're half overwhelmed


1:08:53
Speaker 1 :beautifully put and i think there's no
 better place to end it steve thank you so muchi really appreciate it it was an honor
