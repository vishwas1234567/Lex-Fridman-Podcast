 he's interested in understanding the human genome from a computationalevolutionary biological and other
 cross-disciplinary perspectives he has more big impactful papers andawards than i can list
 but most importantly he's a kind curious brillianthuman being and just someone i really

 kellis what to use the most beautiful aspect ofthe human genome


0:03:57
Speaker 1 :don't get me started
 so we got time um the first answer is that the beauty of genomes transcendshumanity so it's not just about the
 human genome genomes in general are amazinglybeautiful and again i'm obviously biased
 so um in my view uh the way that i like to introduce thehuman genome and the way that i'd like
 to introduce genomics to my class is by telling them you know we're notthe inventors of the first digital
 computer

0:04:26
Speaker 0 :we are the descendants of the first


0:04:27
Speaker 1 :

0:04:28
Speaker 0 :digital computer
 basically life is digital and that's

0:04:32
Speaker 1 :absolutely beautiful about life the fact
 that

0:04:36
Speaker 0 :at every replication step you don't lose


0:04:37
Speaker 1 :any information because that information
 is digital if it was analog it was just protein

0:04:41
Speaker 0 :concentrations


0:04:42
Speaker 1 :you'd lose it after a few generations it
 would just dissolve away

0:04:45
Speaker 0 :

0:04:46
Speaker 1 :and that's what the ancients didn't
 understand about inheritance

0:04:49
Speaker 0 :

0:04:50
Speaker 1 :the first person to understand digital
 inheritance was mendel of course and his theory in factstayed in a bookshelf for like 50 years
 while darwin was getting famous about natural selection

0:05:01
Speaker 0 :

0:05:02
Speaker 1 :but the missing component was this


0:05:03
Speaker 0 :digital inheritance


0:05:04
Speaker 1 :the mechanism of evolution that mendel
 had discovered so that aspect in my view is the mostbeautiful aspect but it transcends all


0:05:14
Speaker 0 :of life
 and can you elaborate maybe the inheritance partwhat was the what was the key thing that


0:05:21
Speaker 1 :the ancients didn't understand
 so the very theory of inheritance uh as discrete units you know throughoutthe life
 of mendel and well after his writing people thought thathis p experiments were just a little
 fluke that they were just you know a little exception that wouldnormally not even apply
 to humans that basically what they saw

0:05:45
Speaker 0 :is this continuum of eye color


0:05:48
Speaker 1 :this continuum of skin color this
 continuum of hair color this continuum

0:05:51
Speaker 0 :of height
 and all of these continuums did not fit with a discrete type of inheritance thatmendel was describing


0:05:58
Speaker 1 :but what's unique about genomics and
 what's unique about the genome is really that there aretwo copies and that you get a


0:06:04
Speaker 0 :combination of these
 but for every trait there are dozens of

0:06:08
Speaker 1 :contributing variables
 and it was only ronald fisher in the 20th centurythat basically recognized that


0:06:16
Speaker 0 :even five mendelian traits would add up


0:06:21
Speaker 1 :to a continuum-like inheritance pattern


0:06:23
Speaker 0 :

0:06:24
Speaker 1 :and he you know wrote a series of papers
 that still are very relevant today about sort of this mendelian inheritanceof continuum like traits
 and i think that that was the missing step in inheritanceso well before the discovery of the
 structure of dna which is again another amazingly beautiful aspectthe double helix what i like to call the
 most noble molecule over time is uh you know holds within it thesecret of that discrete inheritance
 but the conceptualization of discrete you knowelements is something that precedes that


0:06:59
Speaker 0 :so even though it's discrete
 when it uh materializes itself into actual traits that we see it can becontinuous it can
 basically arbitrarily rich and complex

0:07:10
Speaker 1 :so if you have five
 genes that contribute to human height and there aren't five there's a thousand

0:07:17
Speaker 0 :if there's only five genes and you
 inherit some combination of them

0:07:20
Speaker 1 :and everyone makes you two inches taller


0:07:23
Speaker 0 :or two inches shorter


0:07:24
Speaker 1 :it'll look like a continuum trait a


0:07:26
Speaker 0 :

0:07:27
Speaker 1 :continuous trait
 but instead of five there are thousands

0:07:29
Speaker 0 :and every one of them contributes to
 less than one millimeter we change in heightmore during the day than each of these
 genetic variants contributes

0:07:38
Speaker 1 :so by the evening you're shorter than
 you were you woke up with isn't it weird

0:07:43
Speaker 0 :then
 that we're not more different than we are why are we all so similarif there's so much possibility to be


0:07:51
Speaker 1 :different yeah
 so so there are selective advantages to being medium if you're extremely tallor extremely short
 you run into selective disadvantages so you have trouble breathing you havetrouble running you have trouble
 sitting if you're too tall if you're too short you might i don't knowhave other selective pressures are
 acting against that if you look at natural history of human populationthere's actually selection for height
 in northern europe and selection against height in southern europeso there might actually be advantages to
 actually being not not super tall and if you lookacross the entire human population
 you know for many many traits there's a lot of push towards the middleuh balancing selection is you know the
 usual term for selection that sort of seeks to notbe extreme
 and to sort of have a combination of allelesthat sort of you know keep recombining
 and if you look at you know mate selection super super tallpeople
 will not tend to sort of marry super super tall people very often you seethese couples that are kind of
 compensating for each other and the best predictor of the kids ageis very often just take the average of
 the two parents and then adjust for sex and

0:09:06
Speaker 0 :boom you get it it's extremely heritable
 let me ask uh you kind of uh took a step back to thegenome
 outside of just humans but is there something that you find beautiful aboutthe human genome specifically


0:09:18
Speaker 1 :so i think that genome if more people
 understood the beauty of the human genome there would be so many fewer warsso much less anger in the world i mean
 what's really beautiful about the human genome isreally the variation that teaches us
 both about individuality

0:09:36
Speaker 0 :and about similarity so any two people
 on the planet are 99.9 identical

0:09:44
Speaker 1 :how can you fight with someone who's
 99.9 identical to you it's just

0:09:47
Speaker 0 :counterintuitive
 and yet any two siblings of the same parentdiffer in millions of locations so every


0:09:57
Speaker 1 :one of them
 is basically two to the million unique

0:09:59
Speaker 0 :from any pair of parents


0:10:02
Speaker 1 :let alone any two random parents on the


0:10:05
Speaker 0 :planet so


0:10:06
Speaker 1 :that's i think something that teaches us
 about sort of the nature of humanity in many waysthat every one of us is as unique as any
 star and way more unique in actually manyways and
 uh yet we're all brothers and sisters

0:10:22
Speaker 0 :and yeah just like stars most of it is
 just uh

0:10:25
Speaker 1 :fusion uh reactions yeah you only have a
 few parameters to describe stars you know mass size initial size and youknow stage of life
 whereas for humans it's you know thousands of parametersscattered across our genome so the other
 thing that makes humans unique the other things that makes inheritanceunique in humans
 is that most species inherit things vertically basicallyinstinct


0:10:53
Speaker 0 :is a huge part of their behavior the way


0:10:55
Speaker 1 :that
 you know i mean with my kids we've been watching thisnest of birds with two little eggs
 you know outside our window for the last few months uh for the last few weeks asthey've been growing and there's so much


0:11:08
Speaker 0 :behavior
 that's hard-coded birds don't just learn

0:11:12
Speaker 1 :as
 they grow they don't you know there's no culture likea bird that's born in boston will be the
 same as a bird that's born in california so there's not as much uminheritance of ideas of customs a lot of


0:11:26
Speaker 0 :

0:11:27
Speaker 1 :it is hard-coded in their genome
 what's really beautiful about the human genome is that if you take a person fromtoday
 and you place them back in ancient egypt or if you take a person from ancientegypt and you
 place them here today they will grow up

0:11:40
Speaker 0 :to be completely normal
 that is not genetics this is

0:11:48
Speaker 1 :the other type of inheritance in humans
 so on one hand we have genetic inheritancewhich is vertical from your parents down


0:11:55
Speaker 0 :

0:11:56
Speaker 1 :on the other hand we have horizontal
 inheritance which is the ideas that are built up at every

0:12:00
Speaker 0 :generation
 are horizontally transmitted and the huge amount of time that we spend

0:12:06
Speaker 1 :in educating ourselves a concept known


0:12:10
Speaker 0 :as
 niotini neo for newborn and then tenney for

0:12:15
Speaker 1 :holding so if you look at humans i mean
 the little birds they were you know eggs two weeks ago and thatnow one of them has already flown off
 the other one's ready to fly off in two weeks they're ready to just fend

0:12:27
Speaker 0 :for themselves humans


0:12:28
Speaker 1 :16 years 18 years 24 getting out of
 college

0:12:33
Speaker 0 :i'm still learning so so that's so
 fascinating the this picture of a vertical in the horizontali when you talk about the horizontal is
 it in the realm of ideas exactly okay so it's the actual social

0:12:44
Speaker 1 :interactions and that's exactly right
 that's exactly right so basically the concept of neotimi

0:12:50
Speaker 0 :is that you spend acquiring
 characteristics from your environment in an extremely malleable state of yourbrain and the wiring of your brain
 for a long period of your life compared to primateswe are useless you take any primate at


0:13:03
Speaker 1 :seven weeks


0:13:06
Speaker 0 :and in human at seven weeks we lose the
 battle but at eighteen years you know all bets

0:13:10
Speaker 1 :are off like we


0:13:13
Speaker 0 :basically our brain continues to develop
 in an extremely malleable form until very late and this is what allowseducation


0:13:20
Speaker 1 :this is what allows the person from
 egypt to do extremely well

0:13:23
Speaker 0 :now and the reason for that is that
 the wiring of our brain

0:13:31
Speaker 1 :and the development of that wiring is


0:13:32
Speaker 0 :actually delayed


0:13:34
Speaker 1 :so you know the longer you delay that
 the more opportunity you have

0:13:38
Speaker 0 :to pass on knowledge to pass on concepts


0:13:40
Speaker 1 :

0:13:42
Speaker 0 :ideals
 ideas from the parents to the child

0:13:45
Speaker 1 :and what's really absolutely beautiful
 about humans today is that that lateral

0:13:50
Speaker 0 :transfer of ideas and culture


0:13:51
Speaker 1 :is not just from uncles and aunts and
 teachers at school but it's from wikipedia and reviewarticles on the web
 and thousands of journals that are sort of putting outinformation for free and podcasts and
 videocasts and all of that stuff where you can

0:14:09
Speaker 0 :basically learn
 about any topic pretty much

0:14:14
Speaker 1 :everything that would be in any super


0:14:17
Speaker 0 :advanced textbook
 in a matter of days instead of having to

0:14:20
Speaker 1 :go
 to the library of alexandria and sail there to read three books and then sailfor another few days to get to athens
 and et cetera et cetera so the

0:14:30
Speaker 0 :democratization of knowledge
 and the spread the speed of spread of

0:14:32
Speaker 1 :knowledge is what
 defines i think the human inheritance pattern

0:14:38
Speaker 0 :so you sound excited about it about it
 are you also a little bit afraid or you're moreexcited by the power of this kind of
 distributed spread of information so you put it very kindly that most people arekind of using the internet
 in uh you know looking wikipedia reading articles reading papers and so onbut uh if we if we're honest most people
 online especially when they're younger probably looking atfive second clips on tick tock or
 whatever the new social network is are you um given this power ofhorizontal inheritance
 are you optimistic or a little bit pessimisticabout the this new
 effect of the internet and democratization of knowledge on ouron our what would you call this this
 geno like would you would you use the term genome by the way

0:15:31
Speaker 1 :yeah i think um you know we use the
 genome to talk about dna but very often we say you know imean i'm greek so people ask me hey
 what's in the greek genome and i'm like well yeah what's in thegreek genome is both our genes and also
 our ideas and our ideals and our culture so the

0:15:47
Speaker 0 :poetic meaning of the word exactly


0:15:47
Speaker 1 :exactly yeah yeah


0:15:50
Speaker 0 :

0:15:51
Speaker 1 :so i think that um
 there's a beauty to the democratization of knowledgethe fact that you can reach as many
 people as you know any other person on the planetand it's not who you are
 it's really your ideas that matter is a beautiful aspect of the internet the[Music]
 i think there's of course a danger of my ignoranceis as important as your expertise the
 fact that uh with this democratization comes theabolishment
 of respecting expertise just because you've spentyou know 10 000 hours of your life
 studying i don't know human brain circuitrywhy should i trust you i'm just going to
 make up my own theories and they'll be just as good as yoursit's an attitude that that sort of
 counteracts the beauty of the democratization and i think thatwithin our educational system
 and within the upbringing of our children we have to not onlyteach them knowledge but we have to
 teach them the means to get to knowledge and that you knowit's very similar to sort of you
 fish you catch a fish for a man for one day you fed them for one day you teachthem how to fish
 you fed them for the rest of their life so instead of just gathering theknowledge they need
 for any one task we can just tell them all right here's how you google ithere's how to figure out what's real and
 what's not here's how you check the sourceshere's how you form a basic opinion for
 yourself and i think that

0:17:20
Speaker 0 :

0:17:21
Speaker 1 :inquisitive nature is paramount
 to being able to sort through this huge wealth of knowledge so you need a basiceducational foundation


0:17:31
Speaker 0 :

0:17:33
Speaker 1 :based on which you can then add on
 the sort of domain specific knowledge but that basic educational foundationshould just
 just not just be knowledge but it should also beepistemology the way to acquire


0:17:45
Speaker 0 :knowledge
 i'm not sure any of us know how to do that in this modern day we'reactually learning one of the big
 surprising thing to me about the the coronavirus for example is thattwitter has been
 one of the best sources of information basically like building your own networkof experts
 of of uh you know as opposed to the traditionalcentralized expertise of the who and the
 cdc and the or um or maybe any one particularrespectable person at the top of a
 department in some kind of institution you instead look at ayou know 10 20 hundreds of people
 some of whom are young kids with just that are incredibly good ataggregating data and plotting and
 visualizing that data that's been really surprising to me idon't know what to make of it
 i don't know i don't know how that matures into something stableyou know i don't know if you have ideas
 like what if you were to try to explain to your kidsof how where should you go to learn
 about the about coronavirus what would you say

0:18:55
Speaker 1 :it's such a beautiful example and i
 think uh the current pandemic and the thespeed at which the scientific community
 has moved in the current pandemic i think exemplifiesthis horizontal transfer and the speed
 of horizontal transfer of information

0:19:11
Speaker 0 :the fact that you know the genome was


0:19:12
Speaker 1 :first sequenced
 in early january the first sample was obtained december 292019 a week after the publication of the
 first genome sequence moderna had alreadyfinalized his vaccine design
 and was moving to production i mean this isuh phenomenal the fact that we go from
 not knowing what the heck is killing people in wuhan towow it's starscore v2 and here's the set
 of genes here's the genome here's the sequence here thepolymorphisms et cetera in the matter of
 weeks is phenomenal in that incredible paceof transfer of knowledge there have been


0:19:52
Speaker 0 :

0:19:53
Speaker 1 :many mistakes
 so you know some of those mistakes may have been politically motivated ourother mistakes may have just been
 innocuous errors others may have been misleading thepublic for the greater good
 such as don't wear masks because we don't want the mask to run out i meanthat was very silly in my view and
 a very big mistake but the the spread of knowledge from thescientific community was phenomenal
 and some people will point out to bogus articles that snuck in and made the

0:20:22
Speaker 0 :front page
 yeah they did but within 24 hours they were debunked

0:20:26
Speaker 1 :and went out of the front page and i
 think that's that's the beauty of science todaythe fact that it's not oh knowledge is


0:20:31
Speaker 0 :fixed
 it's the ability to embrace that nothing

0:20:35
Speaker 1 :is permanent
 when it comes to knowledge that everything is the current besthypothesis
 and the current best model that best fits the current dataand the willingness to be wrong the
 expectation that we're going to be wrong and thecelebration of success based on how long
 was i not proven wrong for rather than wow i was exactly rightbecause no one is going to be exactly
 right with partial knowledge

0:20:58
Speaker 0 :

0:21:00
Speaker 1 :but the arc towards perfection
 i think so much more important than how far you are on your first step and ithink that's what sort of


0:21:09
Speaker 0 :

0:21:11
Speaker 1 :the current pandemic has taught us the
 fact that yeah no of course we're gonna make mistakesbut at least we're going to learn from
 those mistakes and become better and learn better and spread informationbetter so
 if i were to answer the question of where would you go to learn

0:21:26
Speaker 0 :about coronavirus first textbook


0:21:27
Speaker 1 :it all starts with a textbook just open
 up a chapter on virology and how coronaviruses workthen some basic epidemiology and sort of
 how pandemics have worked in the past whatare the basic principles surrounding
 these first wave second wave why do they even existthen understanding about growth
 understanding about the are not and rt at you know various time pointsand then understanding the means of
 spread how it spreads from person to personthen how does it get into your cells
 from when it gets into the cells what are thepaths that it takes what are the cell


0:22:03
Speaker 0 :types that express


0:22:04
Speaker 1 :the particular h2 receptor how is your
 immune system interacting with the virus and once your immune system launches

0:22:12
Speaker 0 :your defense how is that helping
 or actually hurting your health what

0:22:14
Speaker 1 :about the cytokine storm what are most
 people dying from why are the comorbidities and these risk

0:22:21
Speaker 0 :factors
 even applying what makes obese people

0:22:24
Speaker 1 :respond more or elderly people respond
 more to the virus while kids are completely you knowyou know very often not even aware that
 they're spreading it so the you know i think there's somebasic


0:22:40
Speaker 0 :questions that you would start from and


0:22:43
Speaker 1 :then
 i'm sorry to say but wikipedia is pretty awesome yeah google is pretty awesomeso it used to be a time it used to be a


0:22:48
Speaker 0 :time maybe five years ago i forget
 i forget when but people kind of made fun of wikipediafor being an unreliable source i never
 quite understood it i thought from the early days it waspretty reliable or better than
 a lot of the alternatives but at this point it's kind of likea solid accessible survey paper on every
 subject ever

0:23:10
Speaker 1 :the there's an ascertainment bias and a
 writing bias so so i think this this is related tosort of people saying oh
 so many nature papers are wrong and they're like why would you publish innature so many nature papers are wrong
 and my answer is no no no so many nature

0:23:26
Speaker 0 :papers are scrutinized


0:23:29
Speaker 1 :and just because more of them are being
 proven wrong than in other articles is actually evidence that they'reactually better papers overall because


0:23:37
Speaker 0 :they're being scrutinized at a rate
 much higher than any other journal so if

0:23:42
Speaker 1 :you basically
 uh judge wikipedia by not the initial content by but by thenumber of revisions
 yeah then of course it's going to be the best source of knowledge eventuallyit's still very superficial you then
 have to go into the review papers etc etc but i mean for most scientificproject
 topics it's extremely superficial but it is quite authoritative because it is theplace that everybody likes to criticize
 you as being wrong you say that it's

0:24:11
Speaker 0 :superficial on a lot of topics that
 i'm i've studied a lot of i find it

0:24:19
Speaker 1 :

0:24:20
Speaker 0 :i don't know if superficial is the right
 word um because superficial kind of implies thatit's not correct


0:24:27
Speaker 1 :no no i don't mean any implication of it
 not being correct it's just superficial it's basicallyonly scratching the surface
 for depth you don't go to wikipedia you go to the review articles but it can be

0:24:38
Speaker 0 :profound in the way that articles rarely
 one of the frustrating things to me aboutlike certain computer science like in
 the machine learning world articles they they don't as often takethe uh the bigger picture view you know
 there's a it's a kind of data set and you showthat it works and you kind of show that
 here's an architectural thing that creates an improvementand so on and so forth but you don't say
 well like what does this mean for the nature of intelligence forfuture data sets we haven't even thought
 about or if you were trying to implement thislike if we took this data set of uh
 a hundred thousand examples and scaled it to a hundred billion exampleswith this method like like look at the
 bigger picture which is what a wikipedia articlewould actually try to do which is like
 what does this mean in the context of computer the broad field of computervision or something like that yeah yeah


0:25:32
Speaker 1 :and no i i agree with you completely
 like but it depends on the topic i mean for some topics there's been ahuge amount of work for other topics
 it's just a stub so you know i got it yeah well yeah

0:25:41
Speaker 0 :actually the
 uh which we'll talk on genomics was not

0:25:47
Speaker 1 :yeah it's great very shallow yeah yeah
 it's not wrong it's just shallow yeah every time i criticize something ishould feel partly responsible
 basically if more people from my community went there and editedit would not be shallow it's just that
 there's different modes of communication indifferent fields and in some fields
 the experts have embraced wikipedia in other fieldsit's relegated and perhaps the reason is
 that if it was any better to start withpeople would invest more time
 but if it's not great to start with then you need a few initial pioneers who willbasically go in and say
 ah enough we're just going to fix that and then i think it'll catch on muchmore


0:26:28
Speaker 0 :so if it's okay before we go on to
 genomics can we linger a little bit longer on the beautyof the human genome
 you've given me a few notes what else what else do you find beautiful about

0:26:41
Speaker 1 :the human genome
 so the last aspect of what makes a human genome uniquein addition to the you know
 similarity and the differences and individuality

0:26:52
Speaker 0 :is that so very early on


0:26:54
Speaker 1 :

0:26:54
Speaker 0 :

0:26:56
Speaker 1 :people would basically say oh you don't
 do that experiment in human you have to learn about that in flyor you have to learn about that in yeast
 first or in mouse first or in a prime at firstand the human genome was in fact
 relegated to sort of oh the last place that youyou're going to go to learn something
 new that has dramatically changed and the reason that changed is human

0:27:16
Speaker 0 :genetics
 we are these species

0:27:21
Speaker 1 :in the planet that's the most studied


0:27:24
Speaker 0 :right now it's embarrassing to say that


0:27:24
Speaker 1 :but this was not the case a few years
 ago it used to be you know first viruses thenbacteria then yeast then
 the fruit fly and the worm then the mouseand eventually human was very far last


0:27:41
Speaker 0 :so it's embarrassing that it took us
 this long to focus on it or the

0:27:46
Speaker 1 :uh it's embarrassing that the model
 organisms have been taken over because of the power of human genetics

0:27:51
Speaker 0 :that right now


0:27:53
Speaker 1 :it's actually simpler to figure out the
 phenotype of something

0:27:58
Speaker 0 :by mining this massive amount of human


0:28:00
Speaker 1 :data
 than by going back to any of the other

0:28:03
Speaker 0 :species and the reason for that is that
 if you look at the natural variation

0:28:06
Speaker 1 :that happens in a population of 7
 billion you basically have a mutation in almost

0:28:11
Speaker 0 :every nucleotide


0:28:13
Speaker 1 :so every nucleotide you want to perturb
 you can go find a living breathing human being and gotest the function of that nucleotide by
 sort of searching the database and finding that person

0:28:22
Speaker 0 :wait why is that embarrassing it's a
 beautiful data set

0:28:25
Speaker 1 :it's embarrassing for the for the model
 organism for the flies

0:28:30
Speaker 0 :yeah exactly i i mean do you do you feel
 on a small tangent is there something of valuein um in the genome of a fly and other
 these model organisms that you miss that wewish we
 would have uh would be looking at deeper

0:28:47
Speaker 1 :so
 directed perturbation of course so i think the place wherethe the place where humans are still
 lagging is the fact that in an animal model you can go and say well let meknock out this gene completely
 and let me knock out these three genes completely and i said the moment you getinto combinatorics it's something you
 can't do in the human because there just simply aren't enough humans on theplanet and again let me be honest
 we haven't sequenced all seven billion people it's not like we haveevery mutation but we know that there's
 a carrier out there so if you look at the trendwith and the speed with which human


0:29:18
Speaker 0 :genetics has progressed we can now


0:29:21
Speaker 1 :find thousands of genes involved


0:29:22
Speaker 0 :in human cognition in human psychology


0:29:28
Speaker 1 :in the emotions and the feelings that we
 used to think are uniquely learned turns out there's a

0:29:32
Speaker 0 :

0:29:32
Speaker 1 :genetic basis to a lot of that
 so the uh you know the the human genome has continued toelucidate
 through these studies of genetic variation so many different processesthat we previously thought were
 you know something that like free will free will is this beautiful concept thathumans have had for
 a long time you know in the end it's just a bunch of chemical reactionshappening in your brain
 and the particular abundance of receptors that you havethis day based on what you ate yesterday
 or that you have been wired with based on you know your parents and yourupbringing etc
 determines a lot of that quote unquote free will component toyou know sort of narrower and narrower
 scale you know sort of

0:30:21
Speaker 0 :slices so how much uh on that point how
 much freedom do you think we have to escape the the constraints ofour genome you're making it sound like
 more and more we're discovering that our genome is actually has thea lot of the story already encoded into
 it how much freedom do we have

0:30:39
Speaker 1 :i uh so so
 let me let me describe what that freedom would look like that freedom would bemy saying oh i'm gonna resist the urge
 to eat that apple because i choose not to butthere are chemical receptors that made
 me not resist the urge to prove my individuality and my freewill by resisting the apple so then
 the next question is well maybe now i'll resist the urge to resist the apple andi'll go for the chocolate instead to
 prove my individuality but then what about those other receptors thatyou know


0:31:15
Speaker 0 :that that might be all encoded in there


0:31:17
Speaker 1 :so it's kicking the bucket down the road
 and basically saying well your choice will may have actually been driven byother things that you actually are not
 choosing so that's why it's very hard to answerthat question well it's hard to know


0:31:29
Speaker 0 :what to do with that i mean if uh if the
 genome has if there's not much freedom it's uh

0:31:37
Speaker 1 :it's the butterfly effect it's basically
 that in the short term

0:31:42
Speaker 0 :

0:31:43
Speaker 1 :you can predict something extremely well
 by knowing the current state of the systembut a few steps down it's very hard to
 predict based on the current knowledge is that because the system is truly freewhen i look at weather patterns i can
 predict the next 10 days is it because the weather it has a lotof freedom and after 10 days
 it chooses to do something else or is it because in fact the system is fullydeterministic


0:32:06
Speaker 0 :

0:32:07
Speaker 1 :and there's just a slightly different
 magnetic feel of the earth slightly more energy arriving from the sun a slightlydifferent spin of the gravitational pull
 of jupiter that is now causing you know all kindsof tides and slight deviation of the
 moon etc maybe all of that can be fully modeledmaybe the fact that china is emitting a
 little more carbon today is actually going to affect the weatherin you know egypt in three weeks
 and all of that could be fully modeled

0:32:32
Speaker 0 :in the same way


0:32:36
Speaker 1 :if you take a complete view of a human


0:32:37
Speaker 0 :being


0:32:39
Speaker 1 :now you know i model everything about


0:32:40
Speaker 0 :you
 the question is can i predict your next step probably

0:32:46
Speaker 1 :but at how far and if it's a little
 further is that because of stochasticity andsort of chaos
 properties of unpredictability of beyond a certain levelor was that actually true free will yeah


0:32:58
Speaker 0 :then yeah
 so the number of variables might might be so you might need to uh build anentire universe


0:33:04
Speaker 1 :to uh to be able to simulate a human and
 then maybe that human will be fully simulatablebut maybe aspects of free will will
 exist and where's that free will coming from it's still coming from the sameneurons
 or maybe from a spirit inhabiting these neurons but againyou know it's very difficult empirically
 to sort of evaluate where does free will beginand sort of chemical reactions and
 electric signals and you know and

0:33:26
Speaker 0 :so on that's on that topic let me ask
 the most absurd question uh that uh most mit faculty role theireyes on but uh
 do what do you think about the simulation hypothesis and the idea that

0:33:39
Speaker 1 :we live in a simulation
 i think it's complete bs okay there's no empirical evidence noit's not absolutely not


0:33:47
Speaker 0 :not in terms of empirical evidence or
 not but uh in terms of a thought experiment does it help youthink about the universe
 i mean so if you look at the genome it's encoding a lot of the information thatis required to create some of the
 beautiful human complexity that we see around usit's an interesting thought experiment
 how much you know uh parameters do we need to umhave in order to model some you know
 this full human experience like if we were tobuild a video game
 yeah how hard it would be to build a video game that's like convincing enoughand fun enough and you know uh
 it has consistent laws of physics all that stuffit's not interesting to use the stock


0:34:30
Speaker 1 :experiment i i mean it's cute
 but you know it's all comes razor i mean what's what's morerealistic the fact that you're actually
 a machine or that you're you know a person what's what'syou know the fact that all of my
 experiences exist inside the chemical molecules that i haveor that somebody's actually you know
 simulating all that i

0:34:49
Speaker 0 :mean well you did refer to humans as a
 digital computer earlier so

0:34:52
Speaker 1 :of course of course but that's not kind


0:34:54
Speaker 0 :of a machine right i know
 i know but i i think

0:34:59
Speaker 1 :the probability of all that is nil and
 let the machines wake me up and just terminate me now if it's noti challenge your machines they're gonna


0:35:09
Speaker 0 :they're gonna wait a little bit
 to see what you're gonna do next it's fun it's fun to watchespecially the clever humans what's the
 difference to you between the way a computer stores information and uh thehuman genome stores information
 so you also have roots and your work would you say you're when you introduceyourself at a bar


0:35:30
Speaker 1 :um it depends who i'm talking


0:35:34
Speaker 0 :would you say it's computational biology
 do you um do you reveal uh your

0:35:42
Speaker 1 :expertise in computers it depends who
 i'm talking to truly i mean basically if i meet someonewho's in computers i'll say
 oh i mean professor in computer science if i meet someone who's in engineering isay computer science and electrical
 engineering if i meet someone in biology i'll sayhey i work in genomics if i meet someone
 in medicine i'm like hey i work on you knowgenetics so you're a fun person to meet


0:36:01
Speaker 0 :at a bar i got you but


0:36:03
Speaker 1 :so no no but i'm trying to say is that i
 i don't i mean there's no single attribute thati will define myself as
 you know there's a few things i know there's a few things i study there's afew things i have degrees on and there's
 a few things that i grant degrees in andyou know i i publish papers across the
 whole gamut you know the whole spectrum ofcomputation to biology etc i mean
 i the complete answer is that i use computer science to understandbiology


0:36:33
Speaker 0 :

0:36:34
Speaker 1 :so i'm a you know i develop
 methods in ai and machine learning statistics and algorithms etcbut the ultimate goal of my career is to
 really understand biology if these things don't advance ourunderstanding of biology
 i'm not as fascinated by them although there are somebeautiful computational problems by
 themselves i've sort of made it my mission to applythe power of computer science to truly
 understand the human genome health diseaseyou know and then the whole gamut of how
 our brain works how our body works and all of thatwhich is so fascinating


0:37:14
Speaker 0 :so the dream there's not an equivalent
 sort of uh complementary dream of understandinghuman biology in order to create an
 artificial life an artificial brain artificialintelligence that supersedes the
 intelligence and the capabilities of us humans

0:37:31
Speaker 1 :it's an interesting question it's a
 fascinating question so

0:37:33
Speaker 0 :understanding the human brain is


0:37:38
Speaker 1 :undoubtedly coupled to how do we make
 better ai because so much of ai has in fact been

0:37:45
Speaker 0 :inspired


0:37:46
Speaker 1 :by the brain it may have taken 50 years
 since the early days of neural networks till we have you know all of theseamazing progress
 that we've seen with uh you know deep belief networks and uhyou know all of these advances in go
 and chess in image synthesis and deep vagues

0:38:11
Speaker 0 :in you name it and but but the
 underlying architecture is very much

0:38:15
Speaker 1 :inspired
 by the human brain which actually pauses a very very interesting question

0:38:21
Speaker 0 :

0:38:23
Speaker 1 :why are neural networks performing so


0:38:26
Speaker 0 :well
 and they perform amazingly well is it because they can simulateany possible function and the answer is
 no no they simulate a very small number

0:38:35
Speaker 1 :of functions
 is it because they can simulate every possible function in the universe

0:38:39
Speaker 0 :and that's where it gets interesting the
 answer is actually yeah a little closer to that

0:38:45
Speaker 1 :and here's where it gets really fun uh


0:38:48
Speaker 0 :if you look at human brain and human
 cognition it didn't evolve in a vacuum it evolved

0:38:53
Speaker 1 :in a world


0:38:55
Speaker 0 :with physical constraints
 like the world that inhabits us it is

0:39:00
Speaker 1 :

0:39:01
Speaker 0 :the world that we inhabit
 and if you look at our senses what do they perceive they perceive

0:39:08
Speaker 1 :different you know
 parts of the electromagnetic spectrum you knowthe hearing is just different movements


0:39:15
Speaker 0 :

0:39:16
Speaker 1 :in air
 the the touch etc i mean all of these things we've built intuitions

0:39:22
Speaker 0 :for the physical world that we inhabit
 and our brains and the brains of all

0:39:24
Speaker 1 :animals


0:39:26
Speaker 0 :evolved for that world and


0:39:30
Speaker 1 :the ai systems that we have built happen


0:39:31
Speaker 0 :to work well with images
 of the type that we encounter in the

0:39:35
Speaker 1 :

0:39:36
Speaker 0 :physical world that we inhabit
 whereas if you just take noise and you add

0:39:41
Speaker 1 :random signal that doesn't match
 anything in our world neural networks

0:39:44
Speaker 0 :will not do as well


0:39:48
Speaker 1 :and that actually um basically
 has this whole loop around this which is

0:39:55
Speaker 0 :this was designed by studying our own


0:39:56
Speaker 1 :brain
 which was evolved for our own world and they happen to do wellin our own world and they happen to make


0:40:02
Speaker 0 :the same types of mistakes that humans
 make

0:40:05
Speaker 1 :many times and of course you can
 engineer images by adding just the right amountof you know sort of pixel deviations to
 make a zebra look like a bamboo and stuff like that or like a table

0:40:18
Speaker 0 :

0:40:19
Speaker 1 :but ultimately the undoctored images at


0:40:22
Speaker 0 :least


0:40:23
Speaker 1 :are very often you know mistaken i don't
 know between muffins and dogs for examplein the same way that humans make those
 mistakes so

0:40:31
Speaker 0 :

0:40:33
Speaker 1 :it's it's on you know there's no doubt
 in my view that the more we understand about the tricks that our human brainhas evolved
 to understand the physical world around us the more we will be able to bringnew computational primitives in our ai
 systems to again better understand not just theworld around us
 but maybe even the world inside us and maybe even the computational problemsthat arise from new types of data that


0:40:58
Speaker 0 :we haven't been exposed


0:40:58
Speaker 1 :to but are yet inhabiting the same
 universe that we live in with a very tiny little subset offunctions from all possible mathematical


0:41:07
Speaker 0 :functions
 yeah and that small subset of functions all that matters to us humans really

0:41:12
Speaker 1 :that's what makes
 it's all that has mattered so far and even within our scientific realmit's all that seems to continue to
 matter but i mean i always like to think about our

0:41:23
Speaker 0 :senses


0:41:25
Speaker 1 :and how much of the physical world
 around us

0:41:28
Speaker 0 :we perceive and if you look at the


0:41:32
Speaker 1 :um ligo experiment over the last
 you know year and a half has been all

0:41:37
Speaker 0 :over the news what what did lago do
 it created a new sense for human beings a sense that has never been sensed inthe history of our planet
 gravitational waves have been traversing the earth

0:41:53
Speaker 1 :since its creation a few billion years


0:41:54
Speaker 0 :ago
 life has evolved senses to sense things that were never before sensed lightwas not perceived by early life no one
 cared and eventually photoreceptors evolved

0:42:12
Speaker 1 :and you know the ability to sense colors
 by sort of catching different parts of that electromagneticspectrum
 and hearing evolved and touch evolved

0:42:22
Speaker 0 :etc


0:42:24
Speaker 1 :but no organism evolved a way to sense
 neutrinos floating through earth or gravitational waves flowing through

0:42:30
Speaker 0 :earth etc
 and i find it so beautiful in the

0:42:33
Speaker 1 :history of not just humanity but


0:42:35
Speaker 0 :life on the planet that we are now able
 to capture additional signals from the physicalworld than we ever knew before


0:42:43
Speaker 1 :and axions for example have been all


0:42:46
Speaker 0 :over the news in the last few weeks
 the concept that we can

0:42:52
Speaker 1 :capture and perceive more of that


0:42:53
Speaker 0 :physical world
 is as exciting as the

0:42:59
Speaker 1 :

0:43:00
Speaker 0 :fact that we are we were blind to it is
 traumatizing

0:43:03
Speaker 1 :

0:43:04
Speaker 0 :before right because that also tells us
 how you know we're in 2020 picture yourself in 30 20or in 20 you know what new senses why
 might we discover is it you know could it be that we'remissing


0:43:19
Speaker 1 :physics that like there's a lot of


0:43:23
Speaker 0 :physics out there that we're just blind
 to completely oblivious to it yeah and yet they're permeating us all

0:43:28
Speaker 1 :

0:43:29
Speaker 0 :the time yes it might be right in front


0:43:30
Speaker 1 :of us


0:43:31
Speaker 0 :so so when you're thinking about
 premonitions

0:43:35
Speaker 1 :yeah yeah a lot of that is ascertainment
 bias like yeah every you know every now and then you're like oh i remembermy friend and then my friend doesn't
 appear and i'll forget that i remember my friend but every now and then myfriend will actually appear i'm like oh
 my god i thought about you a minute ago you

0:43:49
Speaker 0 :just called me that's amazing
 so you know some of that is this but

0:43:51
Speaker 1 :some of that might be that


0:43:54
Speaker 0 :there are within our brain
 sensors for waves that we emit that we're not even aware of and thiswhole
 concept of when i hug my children there's such an emotionaltransfer there that we don't comprehend


0:44:13
Speaker 1 :i mean sure yeah of course we're all
 like hardwired for all kinds of touchy-feely things between parents andkids it's beautiful between partners
 it's beautiful etc

0:44:19
Speaker 0 :but then there are intangible aspects


0:44:23
Speaker 1 :

0:44:26
Speaker 0 :of human communication that i don't
 think it's unfathomable that our brain has actually

0:44:29
Speaker 1 :

0:44:30
Speaker 0 :evolved ways and sensors for it


0:44:33
Speaker 1 :that we just don't capture we don't
 understand the function of the vast majorityof our neurons and maybe our brain is


0:44:39
Speaker 0 :already sensing it but even worse
 maybe our brain is not sensing it at all and we're inoblivious to this until we build a
 machine that suddenly is able to sort of

0:44:46
Speaker 1 :capture
 so much more of what's happening in the

0:44:49
Speaker 0 :natural world so what you're saying
 is we're going physics is going to discover a sensor for love

0:44:56
Speaker 1 :for and maybe maybe dogs are off scale
 for that and we've been oh you know we've beenoblivious to it the whole time because
 we didn't have the right answer yeah and now you're gonna have a little wristthat says oh my god i feel all this love
 in the house i see i sense a disturbance in the force

0:45:13
Speaker 0 :all around us and dogs and cats will
 have zero none

0:45:16
Speaker 1 :none


0:45:20
Speaker 0 :but let's take a step back to


0:45:23
Speaker 1 :our unfortunately one of the 400 topics
 that we had actually planned [Laughter]

0:45:28
Speaker 0 :but to our sad time in 2020 when we only
 have just a few sensors and uh very primitiveearly computers so in your
 you you have a foot in computer science and a floating biologyin your sense how do
 computers represent information differently than like the genome orbiological systems


0:45:51
Speaker 1 :so first of all let me uh let me uh
 correct that no we're in an amazing time in 2020computer science is totally awesome and
 physics is totally awesome and we have understoodso much of the natural world than ever


0:46:07
Speaker 0 :before
 so i am extremely grateful

0:46:11
Speaker 1 :and feeling extremely lucky to be living
 in the time that we are because you know first of all who knowswhen the asteroid will hit
 [Laughter] and second um you know of all timesin humanity this is probably the best
 time to be a human being and this might actually be the best place to be a humanbeing so anyway you know for for anyone
 who loves science this is this is it this is awesome it's a great time

0:46:36
Speaker 0 :

0:46:37
Speaker 1 :at the same time just a swift comment
 all i meant

0:46:40
Speaker 0 :is that uh if we look several hundred
 years from now and we end up somehow not uh destroying the uhourselves yeah
 people will probably look back at this time in computer science

0:46:55
Speaker 1 :and uh at your work of minos at mit


0:46:56
Speaker 0 :

0:46:59
Speaker 1 :i like to joke very often with my
 students that you know we've written so many papers we've published so muchwe've been cited so much and every
 single time i tell my students you know the best is ahead of uswhat we're working on now is the most
 exciting thing i've ever worked on so in a way i dohave this sense of
 yeah even the papers i wrote 10 years ago they were awesome at the timebut i'm so much more excited about where
 we're heading now and i don't mean to minimize any of thestuff we've done in the past but you
 know there's just this sense of excitement about whatyou're working on now
 that as soon as a paper is submitted it's like ughit's old like you know i can't talk
 about that anymore at the same time

0:47:37
Speaker 0 :you're not
 you probably are not going to be able to predict what are the mostuh impactful papers and ideas when
 people look back 200 years from now at your work whatwould be the most exciting papers and it
 may very well be not the thing that you expected

0:47:54
Speaker 1 :or yeah the things you got awards for
 or you know this might be true in some fields i don't know i feel slightlydifferently about it in our field i feel
 that i kind of know what what are theimportant ones and there's a very big
 difference between what the press picks up onand what's actually fundamentally
 important for the field and i think for the fundamentally important ones we kindof have a pretty good idea what they are
 and it's hard to sometimes get the press excited about the fundamental advancesbut you know we we take what we get
 and celebrate what we get and sometimes you know one of our papers which was ina minor journal
 made the front page of reddit and suddenly had like hundreds of thousandsof views
 even though it wasn't a minor journal because you know somebody pitched it theright way that it suddenly caught
 everybody's attention whereas other papers that are sort oftruly fundamental you know we have a
 hard time getting the editors even excited about themwhen so many hundreds of people are
 already using the results and building upon themso i do i do appreciate that there's a
 discrepancy between the perception and the perceived successand the awards that you get for various
 papers but i think that fundamentally and know that you knowsome people i'm
 so so so when you're writing that you're

0:49:04
Speaker 0 :most proud


0:49:06
Speaker 1 :

0:49:07
Speaker 0 :you know you just you trapped yourself
 no no no no i mean is there a line of work that you youhave a sense
 uh is really powerful that you've done today you've done so much work in somany directions which is interesting
 um is there something where you you think is quite special

0:49:25
Speaker 1 :i i mean it's like asking me to say
 which of my three children i love best i meanexactly so i mean and it's such a
 give me question that it's so so difficult not to brag about the awesomework
 that my team and my students have done umand i'll i'll just mention a few of the
 top of my head i mean basically there's a few landmark papersthat i think have shaped
 my scientific path and you know i like to somehow describe itas a linear continuation of one thing
 led to another led to another led to anotherand you know it kind of all started with


0:50:09
Speaker 0 :

0:50:11
Speaker 1 :skip skip skip skip skip let me try to
 start somewhere in the middle so my first phd paper wasuh the first comparative analysis of
 multiple species so multiple complete genomes so for thefirst time we we basically con
 developed the concept of genome-wide evolutionary signatures the fact thatyou could look across the entire genome


0:50:34
Speaker 0 :and understand how things evolve
 and from these signatures of evolution

0:50:37
Speaker 1 :you could go back
 and study any one region and say that's a

0:50:44
Speaker 0 :protein coding gene that's an rna gene


0:50:45
Speaker 1 :that's a regulatory motif
 that's a you know binding site and so forth so

0:50:50
Speaker 0 :sorry so comparing different different
 species

0:50:54
Speaker 1 :of the same so so i think human mouse


0:50:55
Speaker 0 :rat and dog
 you know they're all animals they're all

0:50:59
Speaker 1 :mammals they're all performing
 similar functions with their heart with their brain with their lungs etc etcso there's many functional elements that
 make us uniquely

0:51:09
Speaker 0 :mammalian and those mammalian elements
 are actually conserved

0:51:15
Speaker 1 :99 of our genome does not code for


0:51:16
Speaker 0 :protein
 one percent codes for protein the other 99we frankly didn't know what it does


0:51:24
Speaker 1 :until we started doing these comparative
 genomic studies so basically these series of papers inin my career
 have basically first developed that concept of evolutionary signatures and

0:51:35
Speaker 0 :then apply them to yeast


0:51:38
Speaker 1 :apply them to flies apply them to four
 mammals apply them to 17 fungi apply them to 12 drosophila speciesapply them to them 29 mammals and now
 200 mammals

0:51:46
Speaker 0 :so sorry so can we so the evolutionary
 signatures this seems like a such a fascinating idea uhand we're probably gonna linger in your
 early phd work for two hours but uh

0:51:58
Speaker 1 :

0:51:59
Speaker 0 :what is how can you reveal something
 interesting about the genome by looking at the uhmultiple multiple species
 and looking at the evolutionary

0:52:12
Speaker 1 :signatures yeah like so
 so um you basically uh align the matching regions

0:52:18
Speaker 0 :

0:52:20
Speaker 1 :so everything evolved from a common
 ancestor way way back and mammals evolved from a commonancestor about 60 million years back
 so after you know the meteor that killed off the dinosaurslanded a legend near machu picchu
 we know the crater it didn't allegedly landthat was the aliens okay no just
 slightly north of machu picchu in the gulf of mexico there's a gianthole that that meteorite by the way


0:52:48
Speaker 0 :sorry is that uh definitive to people
 have people um um conclusively uh figured out whatkilled the dinosaurs i think so so it
 was

0:53:00
Speaker 1 :media well you know for volcanic
 activity all kinds of other stuff is coincidingbut the meteor is pretty unique and we
 know how terrifying i wouldn't if i we still have a lot of

0:53:12
Speaker 0 :20 20 left so if i


0:53:15
Speaker 1 :think no no but think about it this way
 so the the dinosaurs ruled the earth

0:53:20
Speaker 0 :for 175 million years


0:53:25
Speaker 1 :we humans have been around for
 what less than one million years if you're super generous about what youcall humans
 and you include gems basically so so uh we are just getting warmed upand you know we've ruled the planet much
 more ruthlessly than tyrannosaurus rex [Laughter]t-rex had much less of an environmental
 impact than we did yeah and um if you if you give us another 154million years
 you know humans will look very different if we make it that farso i think dinosaurs basically are
 much more of life history on earth than we arein all respects but look at the bright
 side when they were killed off another life form emerged mammals and

0:54:09
Speaker 0 :that's that whole
 the evolutionary uh branching that's happened so you you kind of haveuh when you have these evolutionary
 signatures you see is there basically a map of how the genome

0:54:22
Speaker 1 :changed yeah exactly exactly so now
 you can go back to this early mammal that was hiding in cavesand you can basically ask what happened
 after the dinosaurs were wiped out a ton

0:54:32
Speaker 0 :of evolutionary niches opened up
 and the mammals started populating all

0:54:35
Speaker 1 :

0:54:36
Speaker 0 :of these niches
 and in that diversification there was room for expansion of new

0:54:42
Speaker 1 :types of functions
 so some of them populated the air

0:54:48
Speaker 0 :with bats flying a new evolution of


0:54:49
Speaker 1 :

0:54:50
Speaker 0 :light


0:54:52
Speaker 1 :some populated the oceans with dolphins
 and whales going off to swim etc but we all arefundamentally mammals
 so you can take the genomes of all these species and align them on top of each

0:55:05
Speaker 0 :other
 and basically create nucleotide

0:55:09
Speaker 1 :resolution


0:55:10
Speaker 0 :

0:55:11
Speaker 1 :correspondences what my phd work showed
 is that when you do that when you line up species on top of each other

0:55:17
Speaker 0 :you can see that within protein coding
 genes there's a particular pattern of evolution that is dictatedby the level at which evolutionary
 selection acts if i'm coding for a proteinand i change the third codon position of


0:55:33
Speaker 1 :a triplet


0:55:36
Speaker 0 :that codes for that amino acid the same
 amino acid will be encoded so that basically means that any kind ofmutation
 that preserves that translation that is invariant

0:55:46
Speaker 1 :to that ultimate functional assessment


0:55:51
Speaker 0 :that evolution will give is tolerated so


0:55:53
Speaker 1 :for any function that you're trying to


0:55:55
Speaker 0 :achieve there's a set of sequences that
 encode it you can now look at the mapping the

0:56:01
Speaker 1 :you know graph isomorphism if you wish


0:56:04
Speaker 0 :

0:56:05
Speaker 1 :between all of the possible dna
 encodings of a particular function and that function and instead of havingjust that exact
 sequence at the protein level you can think of the set of proteinsequences that all fulfill the same


0:56:17
Speaker 0 :function what's evolution doing


0:56:19
Speaker 1 :

0:56:20
Speaker 0 :evolution has two components one


0:56:21
Speaker 1 :

0:56:22
Speaker 0 :component is random
 blind and stupid mutation the other

0:56:26
Speaker 1 :component
 is super smart ruthless selection that's my mom calling fromgreece
 yes i might be a fully grown man [Laughter]did you just cancel the call wow i know
 i'm in trouble she's gonna be calling the cops[Laughter]


0:56:51
Speaker 0 :so so yeah so there's a lot of encoding
 for the same kind of function yeah so

0:56:54
Speaker 1 :so you now have this mapping between all
 of the set of functions that could all encode the same all of the set ofsequences that can all encode the same
 function

0:57:04
Speaker 0 :what evolutionary signatures does is


0:57:06
Speaker 1 :that it basically looks at the shape


0:57:08
Speaker 0 :

0:57:09
Speaker 1 :of that distribution of sequences that
 all encode

0:57:13
Speaker 0 :the same thing and based on that shape
 you can basically say ooh proteins have a very different shape

0:57:16
Speaker 1 :

0:57:18
Speaker 0 :than rna structures


0:57:20
Speaker 1 :than regulator motifs etc so just by


0:57:22
Speaker 0 :scanning a sequence
 ignoring the sequence and just looking at the patterns of change

0:57:26
Speaker 1 :i'm like wow this thing is evolving like


0:57:28
Speaker 0 :a protein and that thing is evolving
 like a motif and that thing is evolving

0:57:32
Speaker 1 :

0:57:33
Speaker 0 :so that's exactly what we just did for
 covid

0:57:36
Speaker 1 :so our paper that we posted about our
 archive about coronavirus basically took this concept of

0:57:40
Speaker 0 :evolutionary signatures and applied it


0:57:43
Speaker 1 :on the sarsko v2 genome that is


0:57:47
Speaker 0 :responsible for the carbon-19 pandemic


0:57:47
Speaker 1 :

0:57:48
Speaker 0 :uh and comparing it to 44 cerbicovirus


0:57:50
Speaker 1 :species so this is
 the beta word did you just use cervical sarbic virus sars related betacorona virus it's a port ponto so that
 one family of viruses yeah so it was that family by the way wehave 44 species
 that or 24 species in the fam yeah virus

0:58:09
Speaker 0 :is a clever


0:58:10
Speaker 1 :no no but but there's just 44 and again
 we don't call them species in in viruses we call them strange butanyway there's 44 strains


0:58:18
Speaker 0 :and that's a tiny little subset of you


0:58:20
Speaker 1 :know maybe another 50 strains that are
 just far too distantly related most of those only infect batsas the host and a subset of only four or
 five have ever infected humans and we

0:58:33
Speaker 0 :

0:58:33
Speaker 1 :basically took all of those and we
 aligned them in the same exact way that we've alignedmammals and then we looked at
 what proteins are you know which of the currently hypothesized genesfor the coronavirus genome are in fact
 evolving like proteins and which ones are notand what we found is that orf10 the last
 little open reading frame the last little genein the genome is bogus
 that's not a protein at all what is it

0:58:58
Speaker 0 :

0:59:00
Speaker 1 :it's an rna structure


0:59:00
Speaker 0 :that doesn't have a it doesn't get


0:59:03
Speaker 1 :translated into amino acids


0:59:05
Speaker 0 :and that's so it's important to narrow
 down to basically discover what's useful and what's not

0:59:10
Speaker 1 :exactly basically what are what is even
 the set of genes the other thing that these evolutionary signatures showed isthat


0:59:17
Speaker 0 :within or 3a lies a tiny little


0:59:19
Speaker 1 :

0:59:20
Speaker 0 :additional gene encoded within the other


0:59:20
Speaker 1 :gene
 so you can translate a dna sequence in three different reading framesif you start in the first one it's you
 know atg et cetera if you start on the second it's tgc

0:59:32
Speaker 0 :etc and with there's a there's a gene


0:59:34
Speaker 1 :

0:59:34
Speaker 0 :within a gene


0:59:36
Speaker 1 :so there's a whole other protein that we
 didn't know about that might be super

0:59:39
Speaker 0 :

0:59:40
Speaker 1 :important


0:59:41
Speaker 0 :so we don't even know the building


0:59:42
Speaker 1 :blocks of sarsko v2
 so if we want to understand coronavirus biology and eventually find it

0:59:49
Speaker 0 :successfully
 we need to even have the set of genes

0:59:51
Speaker 1 :and and these evolutionary signatures
 that are developed in my phd work we just

0:59:57
Speaker 0 :recently used you know what let's uh
 let's run with that tangent for a little bitif it's okay uh is uh can we talk about
 uh the the kovic 19 a little bit more like how what's your sense about the thegenome
 the proteins the functions that we understand aboutcovet 19 where do we stand in in your
 sense what are the big open problems and andalso


1:00:22
Speaker 1 :

1:00:23
Speaker 0 :you know you you kind of said it's
 important to understand what are the like the the important proteins andlike why is that important


1:00:34
Speaker 1 :so what else does the
 comparison of these species tell us what it tells us is

1:00:40
Speaker 0 :

1:00:41
Speaker 1 :how fast are things evolving it tells us
 about at what level is the acceleration ordeceleration pedal
 set for every one of these proteins so the genome has you know 30 some genes

1:00:53
Speaker 0 :

1:00:54
Speaker 1 :some genes evolve super super fast
 others evolve super super slow if you look at thepolymerase gene that basically
 replicates the genome that's a super slow evolving oneif you look at the nuclear capsid
 protein that's also super slow evolving if you look at the spike

1:01:09
Speaker 0 :one protein


1:01:11
Speaker 1 :this is the part of the spike protein
 that actually touches the h2 receptor and then enables the virus to attachto your cells that's the thing that


1:01:21
Speaker 0 :gives it that


1:01:23
Speaker 1 :that visual yeah the corona look
 basically the coronal look yeah so basically the spike protein sticksout of the virus and there's a first
 part of the protein s1 which basically attaches to the h2receptor
 and then s2 is the latch that sort of pushes and channels the fusion of themembranes and then the incorporation
 of the um viral rna inside our cells which then getstranslated into all of these 30 proteins


1:01:51
Speaker 0 :so the s1 protein is evolving


1:01:54
Speaker 1 :ridiculously fast so if you look at
 the stop professor's gas pedal the gas

1:02:01
Speaker 0 :pedal is all the way down


1:02:04
Speaker 1 :or 8 is also evolving super fast and or
 six is evolving super fast we have no idea what they dowe have some idea but nowhere near what
 s1 is so what the isn't that terrifying that

1:02:14
Speaker 0 :s1 is evol that means
 that's a really useful function and if it's evolving fastdoesn't that mean new strains could be
 created or it does something that means

1:02:21
Speaker 1 :that it's searching for
 how to match how to best match the host so basically anythingin in general in evolution if you look
 at genomes anything that's contacting the environmentis evolving much faster than anything
 that's internal and the reason is that the environment changesso if you look at um the evolution of
 these cervical viruses the s1 protein has evolved very rapidly

1:02:45
Speaker 0 :because it's attaching to different


1:02:46
Speaker 1 :hosts each time we think of them as bats
 but there's thousands of species of bats and to go from one species of bat toanother species of bat you have to
 adjust one to the new ace2 receptor that you'regoing to be facing in that new species
 sorry quick tangent yeah is it

1:02:59
Speaker 0 :fascinating to you
 that viruses are doing this i mean it feels like they're this intelligentorganism
 i mean is it like does that give you pause howincredible it is that they're the the
 evolutionary dynamics that you're describing is actually happeningand they're freaking out figuring out
 how to jump from bass to humans all in this distributed fashion and thenmost of us don't even say they're alive
 or intelligent whatever

1:03:27
Speaker 1 :so intelligence is in the eye of the
 beholder you know stupid is a stupid dose asforest gum would say yes and
 intelligence is as intelligent does so basically if the virus isfinding solutions that we think of as
 intelligent yeah it's probably intelligentbut that's again in the eye of the
 beholder do you think viruses are

1:03:44
Speaker 0 :intelligent
 of course not really no

1:03:48
Speaker 1 :because so incredible so remember
 remember when i was talking about the two components of evolutionone is the stupid mutation yeah which is
 completely blind and the other one is the super smartselection
 which is ruthless so it's not viruses who are smart it's thiscomponent of evolution that's smart
 so it's evolution that that sort of appears smart

1:04:10
Speaker 0 :and how is that happening by huge


1:04:15
Speaker 1 :parallel search across thousands of


1:04:17
Speaker 0 :you know parallel infections throughout


1:04:19
Speaker 1 :the world right now
 yes but so to perfect on that so yes so

1:04:23
Speaker 0 :then the
 the intelligence is in the mechanism but then uh by that argument uh viruseswould be more intelligent because
 there's just more of them so the search they're basically the thebrute force
 search that's happening with viruses because there's so many more of themthan humans
 then they're taken as a whole are more intelligenti mean so you don't think it's possible
 that

1:04:50
Speaker 1 :i i mean who runs would we even be here


1:04:53
Speaker 0 :with if viruses weren't
 i mean who runs this thing so

1:04:58
Speaker 1 :survivors so let me answer yeah let me
 answer your your question

1:05:04
Speaker 0 :um so um


1:05:06
Speaker 1 :we would not be here if it wasn't for
 viruses yes and part of the reason is that if youlook at mammalian evolution
 early on in this mammalian radiation that basically happened after the deathof the dinosaurs
 is that some of the viruses that we had

1:05:21
Speaker 0 :in our genome
 spread throughout our genome and created binding sites for new classes of

1:05:27
Speaker 1 :

1:05:29
Speaker 0 :regulatory proteins


1:05:30
Speaker 1 :and these binding sites that landed all
 over our genome are now control elements that basicallycontrol our genes
 and sort of help the complexity of the circuitryof mammalian genomes so you know
 everything's co-evolution and we're

1:05:45
Speaker 0 :working together


1:05:48
Speaker 1 :

1:05:49
Speaker 0 :yeah but and yet you saw
 they just don't care they don't care another thing oh is the virus trying tokill us no it's not the virus is not
 trying to kill you it's true

1:05:59
Speaker 1 :it's not it's actually actively trying


1:06:00
Speaker 0 :to not kill you
 so when you get infected if you die

1:06:06
Speaker 1 :palmer i killed him is what the reaction
 of the virus will be why because that

1:06:10
Speaker 0 :virus won't spread
 many people have a misconception of oh

1:06:12
Speaker 1 :viruses are smart or
 oh viruses are mean they don't care

1:06:16
Speaker 0 :

1:06:19
Speaker 1 :it like you have to clean yourself of
 any kind of anthropomorphism out there i don't know oh yes

1:06:26
Speaker 0 :so there's a there's a sense when taken
 as a whole that there's

1:06:31
Speaker 1 :it's in a eye of the beholder stupid is
 a stupid does intelligent injustice intelligence doesso if you want to call them intelligent
 that's fine then because and the end result is that they'refinding amazing solutions


1:06:42
Speaker 0 :right i mean i mean but they're all
 they're so dumb about it they're just doing dumb they don't care they're not

1:06:47
Speaker 1 :dumb and they're not interested


1:06:48
Speaker 0 :they don't care they care the care word
 is really interesting exactly i mean

1:06:51
Speaker 1 :there could be an argument that they're
 conscious

1:06:54
Speaker 0 :they're just dividing they're not
 they're just dividing they're just a little entity whichhappens to be dividing and spreading it


1:07:03
Speaker 1 :does doesn't want to kill us in fact it


1:07:04
Speaker 0 :prefers not to kill us
 it just wants to spread and when i say once again i'm anthropomorphizing

1:07:11
Speaker 1 :but it's just that if you have two
 versions of a virus one acquires a mutation that spreads morethat's going to spread more one acquires
 a mutation that's pressed less that's going to be lostyes one acquires a mutation that enters


1:07:23
Speaker 0 :faster that's going to be kept


1:07:24
Speaker 1 :one requires a mutation that kills you
 right away it's going to be lost

1:07:29
Speaker 0 :so over evolutionary time the viruses


1:07:31
Speaker 1 :that spread super well
 but don't kill the host are the ones

1:07:34
Speaker 0 :that are going to survive
 yeah but so you see you brilliantly describe the basic mechanisms of how itall happens but when you zoom out
 and you see the uh you know the entirety of viruses maybe acrossdifferent strains of viruses it seems
 like a living organism

1:07:52
Speaker 1 :

1:07:53
Speaker 0 :i am in awe of biology i find biology
 amazingly beautiful i find the design

1:08:00
Speaker 1 :of the current coronavirus however


1:08:00
Speaker 0 :lethal it is amazingly beautiful
 the way that it is encoded the way that it tricksyour cells into making 30 proteins from
 a single rna human cells don't do that human cellsmake
 one protein from each rna molecule they don't make two they make onewe are hardwired to make only one
 protein from every rna molecule and yet this virus goes in throws in asingle messenger rna
 just like any messenger rna we have tens of thousands of messenger rnas in our

1:08:31
Speaker 1 :

1:08:32
Speaker 0 :cells in any one time
 in every one of our cells it throws in one rnaand that rna is so


1:08:39
Speaker 1 :i'm going to use your word here not my
 word intelligent

1:08:43
Speaker 0 :yeah that it hijacks the entire
 machinery of your human cell yeah it basicallyhas at the beginning a giant open
 reading frame that's a giant protein that getstranslated two-thirds of that rna
 make a single giant protein that single

1:09:02
Speaker 1 :protein
 is basically what a human cell would make it's like oh here's a start codoni'm going to start translating here
 human cells are kind of dumb i'm sorry again this isnot the word that we normally use but
 the human cell basically is oh this is an rna it must be mine let me translateand it starts translating it and then


1:09:17
Speaker 0 :you're in trouble why
 because that one protein as it's growing gets cleaved into about 20 differentpeptides
 the first peptide and the second peptide startinteracting and the third one and the
 fourth one and they shut off the ribosome of the whole cellto not translate human
 rnas anymore so the virus basically

1:09:43
Speaker 1 :hijacks


1:09:45
Speaker 0 :your cells and it cuts it cleaves every
 one of your human rnas to basically say to the ribosome don't

1:09:51
Speaker 1 :

1:09:52
Speaker 0 :translate this one junk don't look at
 this one junk and it only spares its own rnas

1:09:58
Speaker 1 :because they have a particular mark that


1:10:00
Speaker 0 :it spares then all of the ribosomes that


1:10:03
Speaker 1 :normally make protein
 in your human cells are now only able to translate

1:10:07
Speaker 0 :

1:10:08
Speaker 1 :viral rnas and make more and more and


1:10:09
Speaker 0 :

1:10:10
Speaker 1 :more and more of them
 that's the first 20 proteins in fact halfway down aboutprotein 11 between you know 11 and 12


1:10:18
Speaker 0 :you basically have a translational
 slippage where the ribosome skips reading frame

1:10:24
Speaker 1 :and it translates from one reading frame
 to another reading frame that means that about half of them are going to betranslated from 1 to
 11 and the other half are going to be translated from 12 to 16.

1:10:32
Speaker 0 :wow it's gorgeous and then
 then you're done then that mrna will never translate elastin proteins butspike is the one right after that one so
 how does spike even get translated this positive strand rna virus has areverse transcriptase
 which is an rna-based reverse

1:10:51
Speaker 1 :transcriptase so from the rna on the


1:10:53
Speaker 0 :positive strand it makes an rna of the
 negative strand and in between every single one of thesegenes these open reading frames
 there's a little signal aac gca or something like thatthat basically loops over to the


1:11:07
Speaker 1 :beginning


1:11:09
Speaker 0 :of the rna and basically instead of sort


1:11:11
Speaker 1 :of having a single
 full negative strand or an a it

1:11:14
Speaker 0 :basically has a partial negative strand
 rna that ends right before the beginning ofthat gene and another one that ends
 right before the beginning of that gene

1:11:22
Speaker 1 :these negative strand rnas now make


1:11:24
Speaker 0 :positive strand rnas


1:11:25
Speaker 1 :that then look to the human whole cell
 just like any other

1:11:29
Speaker 0 :human mrna it's like oh great i'm going


1:11:31
Speaker 1 :to translate that one because it doesn't
 have the cleaving that the virus has now

1:11:34
Speaker 0 :put on all your human genes
 and then you've lost the battle that cell is now only making proteins for thevirus
 that will then create the spike protein

1:11:45
Speaker 1 :the envelope protein the membrane
 protein the nucleocapsid protein that

1:11:49
Speaker 0 :will package up the rna
 and then sort of create new viral envelopesand these will then be secreted out of
 that cell in new little packages that will then

1:11:58
Speaker 1 :infect the rest of the cells and repeat


1:12:01
Speaker 0 :the whole process


1:12:02
Speaker 1 :beautiful right it's hard not to


1:12:04
Speaker 0 :anthropomorphize it


1:12:06
Speaker 1 :

1:12:07
Speaker 0 :oh but it's so gorgeous so there is a
 beauty to it is there is it is it terrifying to you

1:12:14
Speaker 1 :so this is something that has happened
 throughout history humans have been nearly wiped out over and over and over

1:12:20
Speaker 0 :again and yet never fully wiped out
 so i'm yeah i'm not concerned about the

1:12:24
Speaker 1 :human race i'm not even concerned about
 you know the impact on sort of our our survival as a species umthis is absolutely something i mean you
 know human life is so invaluable and everyone of us is so invaluable but if you
 think of it as sort of is this the end of ourspecies
 by by no means basically so so let me explain

1:12:48
Speaker 0 :the black death killed what 30 of europe


1:12:50
Speaker 1 :

1:12:51
Speaker 0 :that has left a tremendous imprint


1:12:55
Speaker 1 :uh you know a huge hole a horrendous


1:12:58
Speaker 0 :hole
 in the genetic makeup of humans

1:13:05
Speaker 1 :there's been series of wiping out of


1:13:06
Speaker 0 :huge fractions of entire species or just


1:13:11
Speaker 1 :

1:13:11
Speaker 0 :entire species all together
 and that has a consequence on the human immune repertoireif you look at how europe was shaped


1:13:24
Speaker 1 :and how africa was shaped by malaria for
 example all the individuals that carry amutation that protected from malaria


1:13:31
Speaker 0 :

1:13:32
Speaker 1 :were able to survive much more and if
 you look at the frequency of sickle cell disease and the frequencyof malaria


1:13:38
Speaker 0 :

1:13:38
Speaker 1 :the maps are actually showing the same
 pattern the same imprint on africa and that basically led people tohypothesize that the reason why sickle
 cell disease is so much more frequent in americans of african descent isbecause there was selection in africa


1:13:51
Speaker 0 :against malaria leading to sickle cell


1:13:55
Speaker 1 :because when the cells sickle malaria is
 not able to you know replicate inside your cells aswell and therefore you protect against
 that

1:14:03
Speaker 0 :so if you look at human disease all of
 the genetic associations that we do

1:14:06
Speaker 1 :

1:14:08
Speaker 0 :with human disease you basically see


1:14:11
Speaker 1 :the imprint of these


1:14:14
Speaker 0 :waves of selection killing off


1:14:16
Speaker 1 :gazillions of humans


1:14:18
Speaker 0 :and there's so many immune
 processes that are coming up as associated with so many different

1:14:24
Speaker 1 :diseases
 the reason for that is similar to what i was describing earlier where the

1:14:29
Speaker 0 :outward facing proteins evolve much more
 rapidly because the environment is always

1:14:35
Speaker 1 :changing but what's really interesting


1:14:35
Speaker 0 :

1:14:37
Speaker 1 :the human genome is that we have


1:14:38
Speaker 0 :co-opted many of these immune genes to


1:14:41
Speaker 1 :carry out non-immune functions


1:14:43
Speaker 0 :for example in our brain we use immune
 cells to cleave off neuronal connections thatdon't get used
 this whole user will lose it we know the mechanism it's microglia the cleave ofneuronal synaptic connections that are
 just not utilized

1:14:59
Speaker 1 :when you utilize them you mark them in a
 particular way that basically when the microglia

1:15:04
Speaker 0 :come tell it don't kill this one it's


1:15:05
Speaker 1 :it's used now
 and the microwave will go off and kill once you don't use this is an immune

1:15:10
Speaker 0 :function which is co-opted to do


1:15:12
Speaker 1 :non-immune things


1:15:15
Speaker 0 :if you look at our adipocytes m1 versus


1:15:18
Speaker 1 :m2 macrophages inside our fat
 will basically determine whether you're

1:15:21
Speaker 0 :obese or not and these are again immune
 cells that are resident and living within

1:15:25
Speaker 1 :

1:15:27
Speaker 0 :these tissues so many disease


1:15:29
Speaker 1 :associations


1:15:30
Speaker 0 :that we co-opt these kinds of things for
 incredibly uh complicated functions exactly evolution works in

1:15:38
Speaker 1 :so many different ways which are all
 beautiful and mysterious it's not intelligent not intelligentit's in the eye of the beholder
 [Laughter] but but but the the the point that i'mtrying to make is that
 if you look at the imprint that kovit will havehopefully it will not be big hopefully
 the u.s will get attacked together and stop the virus fromspreading further but if it doesn't it's


1:16:02
Speaker 0 :having an imprint


1:16:03
Speaker 1 :on individuals who have particular
 genetic repertoires so if you look at now the genetic

1:16:08
Speaker 0 :associations of blood type


1:16:10
Speaker 1 :and immune function cells etc there's
 actually association genetic variation that basically says how much more likelyam i or you to die
 if we contact the virus and it's it's

1:16:21
Speaker 0 :through these rounds of shaping
 the human genome that humans have basically made it so farand uh selection


1:16:29
Speaker 1 :is ruthless and it's brutal and it only
 comes with a lot of killing but this is the way that viruses andenvironments have shaped the human
 genome basically when you go through periods of famine

1:16:41
Speaker 0 :you select for particular genes and
 what's left is not necessarily better it's just

1:16:47
Speaker 1 :whatever survived


1:16:48
Speaker 0 :and it may have been the surviving one


1:16:50
Speaker 1 :back then not because it was better
 maybe the ones that ran slower survived i mean you know again not necessarilybetter
 but the surviving ones are basically the ones that thenare shaped for any kind of subsequent
 evolutionary condition and environmental conditionbut if you look at


1:17:08
Speaker 0 :for example obesity obesity was selected
 for

1:17:12
Speaker 1 :basically the genes that now predisposes
 to obesity were at two percent frequency

1:17:14
Speaker 0 :in africa
 they rose to 44 frequency in europe wow that's fascinatingbecause you basically went through the
 ice ages and there was a scarcity of food

1:17:24
Speaker 1 :so you know there was a selection to
 being able to store every single

1:17:28
Speaker 0 :calorie you consume eventually
 environment changes so the better allele

1:17:34
Speaker 1 :which was the
 fat storing allele became the worst

1:17:36
Speaker 0 :

1:17:37
Speaker 1 :allele because it's
 the fat storing allele it still has the

1:17:39
Speaker 0 :

1:17:41
Speaker 1 :same function
 so if you look at my genome speaking of mom calling

1:17:46
Speaker 0 :mom gave me a bad copy of that gene
 these fto locus

1:17:49
Speaker 1 :

1:17:50
Speaker 0 :basically has to do with the obesity or
 the obesity

1:17:53
Speaker 1 :yeah i basically now have a bad copy
 from mom that makes me more likely to be

1:17:57
Speaker 0 :obese and i also
 also have a bad copy from dad that makes

1:17:59
Speaker 1 :me more likely to be obese i'm


1:18:02
Speaker 0 :homozygous


1:18:04
Speaker 1 :and that's the allele
 it's still the minor allele but it's at

1:18:07
Speaker 0 :44 frequency


1:18:10
Speaker 1 :in southeast asia 42 frequency in europe


1:18:12
Speaker 0 :even though it started at 2
 it was an awesome allele to have 100 years ago

1:18:18
Speaker 1 :right now it's pretty terrible so the


1:18:20
Speaker 0 :other concept is that diversity matters
 if we had a hundred million nuclear

1:18:25
Speaker 1 :physicists living the earth right now


1:18:27
Speaker 0 :we'd be in trouble you need diversity
 you need artists and you need musicians and you need mathematicians and you needyou know politicians yes even those and


1:18:36
Speaker 1 :you need like


1:18:39
Speaker 0 :it's not it's not get crazy enough but
 so because then if uh virus comes along or whatever

1:18:44
Speaker 1 :exactly exactly so no there's two
 reasons number one you want diversity and immune repertoire

1:18:50
Speaker 0 :and we have built in diversity


1:18:51
Speaker 1 :so basically they're they are the most
 diverse basically if you look at our immune system there's layers and layersof diversity


1:18:57
Speaker 0 :like the way that you create your cells


1:19:01
Speaker 1 :generates diversity because of the
 selection for the vdj recombination that basicallyeventually leads to a huge number of
 repertoires but that's only one small component ofdiversity the blood type is another one
 the major histogram histocompatibility complex the hlaalleles are
 you know another source of diversity so the immune system of humansis by nature incredibly diverse


1:19:23
Speaker 0 :

1:19:24
Speaker 1 :and that basically leads to resilience
 so basically what i'm saying that i don't worry for the human speciesbecause we are so diverse
 immunologically we are likely to be very resilientagainst
 so many different attacks like this

1:19:40
Speaker 0 :current virus so you're saying
 natural pandemics may not be something that you're really afraid ofbecause of the diversity in our
 genetic makeup what about engineered pandemicsdo you have fears of us messing
 with the makeup of viruses or well yeah let's say with the makeup of viruses tocreate something that we can't control
 and we'd be much more destructive than it would come about naturally

1:20:06
Speaker 1 :remember how we were talking about how
 smart evolution is

1:20:09
Speaker 0 :

1:20:10
Speaker 1 :humans are much dumber so you mean like
 human scientists yeah humans humans just humans overall yeahbut i mean even you know the sort of
 synthetic biologists um you know basically

1:20:23
Speaker 0 :

1:20:24
Speaker 1 :if you were to create a you know
 virus like sars that will kill other people you would probably starsstart with stars so whoever
 you know would like to design such a thing would basically start with starstree or at least some relative of stars
 the source genome for the current virus was something completely different itwas something that has never infected


1:20:49
Speaker 0 :humans
 no one in their right mind would have

1:20:51
Speaker 1 :

1:20:52
Speaker 0 :started there oh but when you say source
 is like the nearest

1:20:55
Speaker 1 :the nearest relative relative he's in a
 whole other branch no species of which has ever infectedhumans in that branch
 so you know let's put this to rest this was not designedby someone to kill off the human race so
 you don't you don't believe it was

1:21:09
Speaker 0 :

1:21:10
Speaker 1 :engineered
 the likely yeah the the path to engineering a deadly virus would notcome
 from this strain that got it that was useduh moreover there's been various
 um claims of haha this was mixed and matched in labbecause the s1 protein has three
 different components each of which has a different evolutionary treeso you know a lot of popular press
 basically said aha this came from pangolin and this camefrom you know all kinds of other species
 this is what has been happening throughout the coronavirus treeso basically the s1 protein has been
 recombining across species all the time remember when i was talking about thepositive strand the negative strands sub
 genomic rnas these can actually recombine and if youhave two different viruses infecting the
 same cell they can actually mix and match betweenthe positive strand and the negative
 strand and basically create a new hybrid virus with recombinationthat now has the s1 from one
 and the rest of the genome from another and this is something that happens a lotin s1 you know
 fade etc and that's something that's true of the whole trainingfor the whole family exactly viruses so
 it's not like someone has been messing with this for millions of yearsand you know changing
 this happens naturally that's again

1:22:21
Speaker 0 :beautiful that that somehow happens that
 they recombine in the so two different strands can affect thebody and recombine
 so all of this actually magic happens inside uhhosts like all like yeah yeah that way


1:22:36
Speaker 1 :that's why classification wise virus is
 not thought to be alive because it doesn't self-replicate it'snot autonomous it's something that
 enters a living cell and then co-opts it tobasically make it its own
 but by itself people ask me how do we kill this bastard i'm like you stop itfrom replicating


1:22:53
Speaker 0 :

1:22:54
Speaker 1 :it's not like a bacterium that will just
 live in a you know puddle or something it's a virus viruses don't live withouttheir host
 and they only live in their house for very little time so if you stop it fromreplicating
 it'll stop from spreading i mean it's not like hiv which can stay dormant fora long time basically coronaviruses just
 don't do that they're not integrating genomes there are any genomesso if it's not expressed it degrades rna
 degrades

1:23:21
Speaker 0 :it doesn't just stick around well let me
 ask also um about the immune system you mentioned alot of people kind of ask
 you know um how can we strengthen the immune systemto respond to this particular virus but
 the viruses in general do you have from a biologicalperspective thoughts on what we can do
 as humans

1:23:43
Speaker 1 :uh too if you look at our traits across
 different countries people with less vaccination have beendying more
 if you look at north italy the vaccination rates areabysmal there and a lot of people have
 been dying if you look at greece very good vaccination rates almost noone has been dying
 so yes there's a policy component so italy reacted very slowly greecereacted very fast
 so yeah many fewer people died in greece but there might actually bea component of genetic immune repertoire
 basically how did people die off you know in the historyof the greek population versus the
 italian population there's a

1:24:22
Speaker 0 :that's interesting to think about uh and


1:24:24
Speaker 1 :then there's a component
 of what vaccinations did you have as a kid and what are the off-target effectsof those vaccinations
 so basically a vaccination can have two components one istraining your your immune system against
 that specific insult the second one is boosting up yourimmune system for all kinds of other
 things if you look at allergies northern europe

1:24:46
Speaker 0 :

1:24:48
Speaker 1 :super clean environments tons of
 allergies southern europe my kids grew up eatingdirt
 no allergies so growing up i never had even heard of whatallergies are like really allergies
 and the reason is that i was playing in the garden i was putting all kinds ofstuff in my mouth from you know all
 kinds of dirt and stuff tons of viruses there tons of bacteriathere you know my immune system was
 built up so the more you protect your immunesystem from exposure
 the less opportunity it has to learn about non-selfrepertoire in a way that prepares it for
 the next insult

1:25:25
Speaker 0 :so it's a horizontal thing too like the
 says throughout your lifetime in the lifetime of theof the people that uh your ancestors
 yeah that kind of thing yeah what about the so again it returnsagainst free will
 on the free will side of things is there something we could doto strengthen our immune system in 2020


1:25:45
Speaker 1 :is there like uh you know exercise


1:25:47
Speaker 0 :diet all that kind of stuff so it's kind


1:25:50
Speaker 1 :of funny um
 there's a cartoon that basically shows uh two windowswith a teller in each window one has a
 humongous line and the other one has no one the onethat has no one above says
 health no it says exercise and diet and the other one says pill yeahand there's a huge line for pill so
 we're looking basically for magic bullets for sort ofways that we can you know beat cancer
 and beat coronavirus and beat this and beat that and it turns out that thewindow with
 like just diet and exercise is the best way to boostevery aspect of your health if you look
 at alzheimer's exercise and nutrition

1:26:30
Speaker 0 :i mean you're like really for my brain
 neurodegeneration absolutely if you look at cancer

1:26:36
Speaker 1 :exercise and nutrition if you look at
 coronavirus

1:26:42
Speaker 0 :exercise and nutrition every single


1:26:43
Speaker 1 :aspect of human health
 gets improved and one of the studies we're doing now is basically looking atwhat
 are the effects of diet and exercise

1:26:53
Speaker 0 :how similar are they to each other we're


1:26:55
Speaker 1 :basically taking


1:26:57
Speaker 0 :diet intervention and exercise


1:26:58
Speaker 1 :intervention in human and in mice
 and we're basically doing single cell profiling of a bunch of differenttissues to basically understand


1:27:06
Speaker 0 :how are the cells both the stromal cells


1:27:08
Speaker 1 :and the immune cells of each of these


1:27:12
Speaker 0 :tissues responding to


1:27:14
Speaker 1 :the effect of exercise what are the
 communication networks between different cellswhere with the muscle that exercises


1:27:22
Speaker 0 :sends signals through the bloodstream


1:27:25
Speaker 1 :through the lymphatic system through all
 kinds of other systems

1:27:29
Speaker 0 :that give signals to other cells that i


1:27:29
Speaker 1 :have exercised and you should change in
 this particular way which basically reconfigure thosereceptor cells


1:27:37
Speaker 0 :with the effect of exercise how well
 understood is the those reconfigurations very little

1:27:44
Speaker 1 :we're just starting now basically is


1:27:47
Speaker 0 :there is the hope there uh
 to understand the effect on uh so like the effect on the immune

1:27:54
Speaker 1 :system on the immune system the effect
 on brain the effect on your liver on yourdigestive system on your adipocytes


1:27:59
Speaker 0 :adipose you know the most misunderstood


1:28:02
Speaker 1 :organ everybody thinks oh


1:28:05
Speaker 0 :fat terrible no fat is awesome your fat


1:28:06
Speaker 1 :cells is what's keeping you alive
 because if you didn't have your fat cells all those lipids and all thosecalories would be floating around in
 your blood and you'd be dead by now your adipocytes are your best friendthey're basically storing
 all these excess calories so that they don't hurtall of the rest of the body and they're
 also fat burning in many ways so you knowagain
 when you don't have the homozygous version that i have your cells are ableto burn calories much more easily
 by sort of flipping a master metabolic

1:28:38
Speaker 0 :switch


1:28:39
Speaker 1 :that involves this fto locus that i
 mentioned earlier and its target genes irx3 and rx5that basically switch your adipocytes
 during their three first days of differentiation asthey're becoming mature dipocytes to
 basically become either fat burning

1:28:55
Speaker 0 :or fat storing fat cells and the fat


1:28:56
Speaker 1 :burning fat cells are your best friends
 they're much closer to muscle than they are to white egg boss eyes is

1:29:02
Speaker 0 :there a lot of difference between people
 like that you could give science couldeventually give advice
 that is very generalizable or is our differences in our genetic makeuplike you mentioned
 is that going to be basically something we have tobe very specialized individuals any
 advice we give in terms of diet like we were just talking about believe

1:29:26
Speaker 1 :it or not the most personalized advice
 that you give for nutrition don't have to do with your genome they

1:29:30
Speaker 0 :

1:29:31
Speaker 1 :have to do with your
 gut microbiome with the bacteria that live inside you so most of yourdigestion is actually happening by
 species that are not human inside you you have more non-human cells and youhave human cells
 you're basically a giant bag of bacteria with a few human cells along

1:29:49
Speaker 0 :and those do not necessarily have to do
 with your genetic makeup

1:29:55
Speaker 1 :they interact with your genetic makeup
 they interact with your ruby genome they interact with your nutrition theyinteract with your environment
 they're you know basically an additional source of variation sowhen you're thinking about sort of
 personalized nutritional advice part of that is actually how do youmatch your microbiome
 and part of that is how do we match your geneticsbut again you know this is a very
 diverse set of um you know contributors and the effectsizes are not
 enormous so i think the science for that is not fully developed yet

1:30:28
Speaker 0 :speaking of dyes because i've wrestled
 in combat sports with sports my whole life orweight matters so you have to cut and
 all that stuff one thing i've learned a lot about mybody and
 which seems to be i think true about other people's bodies is thatyou can adjust to a lot of things that's
 the miraculous thing about this biological systemis um like i fast
 often i used to eat like five six times a dayand thought that was absolutely
 necessary how could you not eat that oftenand then when i started fasting your
 body adjusts to that and you learn how to not eat you knowand it's it was
 uh if you just give it a chance for a few weeks actuallyover a period of a few weeks your body
 can adjust to anything yeah and that's a miraculous that's such a beautiful thing

1:31:14
Speaker 1 :so i'm a computer scientist
 and i've basically gone through periods of 24 hours without eating or stoppingand you know then i'm like oh must eat
 and i eat a ton i used to order two pizzas just with my brother andyou know like so i i've gone through
 these extremes as well and i've gone the wholeintermittent fasting thing so i can
 sympathize with you both on the seven meals a dayto the zero meals a day um so i think
 when i say everything in moderation i i actuallythink your body responds interestingly
 to these different changes in diet i think part of the reason why we loseweight with pretty much every kind of
 change in behavior is because our epigenome and the set of proteinsand enzymes that are expressed
 and our microbiome are not well suited to that nutritional sourceand therefore they will not be able to
 sort of catch everything that you give them and then you know a lot ofthat will go undigested
 and that basically means that your body can then you know lose weight in theshort term but very
 quickly will adjust to that new normal and then we'll be able to sort ofperhaps gain a lot of weight yeah from
 the diet so anyway i mean there's also studies in umfactories where basically
 people you know dim the lights and then suddenly everybody started workingbetter it was like wow that's amazing
 three weeks later they made the lights a little brighter everybody startedworking better
 so any kind of intervention has a placebo effect of wow now i'm healthierand i'm going to be running more often
 etc so it's very hard to uncouple the placebo effect of wow i'm doingsomething to intervene on my diet
 from the wow this is actually the right thing for me

1:32:50
Speaker 0 :so you know yeah from the perspective
 from nutrition science psychology both things i'm interested in especiallypsychology it seems that
 it's extremely difficult to do good sciencebecause uh there's so many variables
 involved it's so difficult to control the variablesso difficult to do sufficiently
 large-scale experiments uh both sort of in terms of number ofsubjects and
 temporal like how long you do the study forthat uh it just seems like it's not even
 a real science for now like nutrition science i want to

1:33:22
Speaker 1 :jump into the whole placebo effect for a
 little bit here and basically talk about theimplications of that
 if i give you a sugar pill and tell you it's a sugar pill

1:33:33
Speaker 0 :

1:33:34
Speaker 1 :you won't get any better but if i tell
 you sugar appeal and tell you and i tell you wow this is an amazing drugit actually will stop your cancer


1:33:41
Speaker 0 :

1:33:43
Speaker 1 :your cash will actually stop with much
 higher probability

1:33:46
Speaker 0 :what does that mean that's so amazing
 that means that if i can trick your brain into thinking that i'm healing youyour brain will basically figure out a
 way to heal itself to heal the body and that tells us that there's so muchthat we don't understand


1:34:01
Speaker 1 :in the interplay between our cognition


1:34:03
Speaker 0 :and our biology that if we were able to


1:34:06
Speaker 1 :

1:34:07
Speaker 0 :better harvest


1:34:08
Speaker 1 :the power of our brain to sort of you
 know impact the body through the placeboeffect we would be


1:34:14
Speaker 0 :so much better in so many different
 things just by tricking yourself into thinking that you're doing better you'reactually doing better


1:34:21
Speaker 1 :so there's something to be said about
 sort of positive thinking about optimism about sort ofyou know just getting your


1:34:28
Speaker 0 :brain and your mind into the right


1:34:31
Speaker 1 :mindset
 that helps your body and helps your entire biologyyeah from a science perspective that's


1:34:37
Speaker 0 :just fascinating i
 obviously most things about the brain is a total mystery for nowbut that's a fascinating interplay that
 the brain yeah that the brain can reduceuh the brain can help cure cancer as a
 i don't even know what to do with that i

1:34:56
Speaker 1 :mean the way to think about that is the
 following the converse of the equation issomething that we are much more
 comfortable with

1:35:04
Speaker 0 :like oh if you're stressed then


1:35:07
Speaker 1 :your heart right might rise and all
 kinds of sort of toxins might be released andthat can have a detrimental effect in
 your body etc so maybe it's easier to understand yourbody


1:35:18
Speaker 0 :healing from your mind by your mind is


1:35:20
Speaker 1 :not killing your body
 or at least it's killing it less so i think the you knowthat aspect of the stress equation is a
 little easier for most of us to conceptualize but thenthe healing part
 is you know perhaps the same pathways perhaps different pathways but againsomething that is totally untapped


1:35:39
Speaker 0 :scientifically i think we try to bring
 this question up a couple of times but let's return to it again is what doyou think is the difference between the
 way a computer represents information the human genomerepresents and stores information
 like what and maybe broadly what is the difference betweenhow you think about computers and how
 you think about biological systems

1:36:00
Speaker 1 :so i made a very provocative claim
 earlier that we are a digital computer like that at the core lies a digitalcode and that's true in many ways but
 surrounding that digital core there's a huge amount of analogif you look at our brain it's not really
 digital if you look at our sort of rna and all of that stuff inside ourcell it's not really digital it's really
 analog in many ways but let's start with the code and then we'll expandto the rest so the code itself is
 digital so there's genes you can think of thegenes as i don't know the
 procedures the functions inside your language and thensomehow you have to turn these functions
 on how do you call a gene how do you call that function the way that youwould do it in old
 programming languages is go to address whatever in your memory and then youstart running from there
 and you know modern programming languages have encapsulated this intofunctions and objects and all of that
 and it's nice and cute but in the end deep downthere's still an assembly code that says
 go to that instruction and it runs that instructionif you look at the human genome and you
 know the genome of pretty much

1:37:05
Speaker 0 :most species out there it's


1:37:07
Speaker 1 :there's no go-to function you just don't
 start in you know transcribing in positionthirteen
 hundred five you know thirteen thousand five hundred twentyseven in chromosome 12. you instead have
 content based indexing so at every location

1:37:23
Speaker 0 :in the genome in front of the genes that


1:37:25
Speaker 1 :need to be turned on
 i don't know when you drink coffee there's a little coffee marker

1:37:32
Speaker 0 :in front of all of them and whenever


1:37:35
Speaker 1 :your
 cells that metabolize coffee need to metabolize coffee they basically seecoffee and they're like oh
 let's go turn on all the coffee marked jeans sothere's basically these small motifs
 these small sequences that we call regulatory motifs they'relike patterns of dna they're only eight
 characters long or so like gat gca et cetera and these motifs work in

1:37:59
Speaker 0 :combinations


1:38:02
Speaker 1 :and every one of them has some
 recruitment

1:38:05
Speaker 0 :affinity for a different protein that


1:38:07
Speaker 1 :will then come and bind it


1:38:09
Speaker 0 :and together collections of these motifs
 create regions

1:38:13
Speaker 1 :that we call regulatory regions that can
 be either promoters near the beginning of the geneand that basically tells you where the
 function actually starts where you call itand then enhancers that are looping
 around of the dna that basically bring the machinery thatbinds those enhancers


1:38:29
Speaker 0 :

1:38:30
Speaker 1 :and then bring it onto the promoter
 which then recruits the right sort of the ribosomeand the polymerase and all of that thing
 which will first transcribe and then export and then eventually translate inthe cytoplasm
 you know whatever rna molecule so

1:38:46
Speaker 0 :the beauty


1:38:50
Speaker 1 :of the way that the digital computer
 that's the genome works is that it's extremely fault tolerant

1:38:58
Speaker 0 :if i took your hard drive and i messed
 with twenty percent of the letters

1:39:02
Speaker 1 :in it of those zeros and ones and i
 flipped them you'd be in trouble if i take the genomeand i flip 20
 of the letters you probably won't even notice

1:39:14
Speaker 0 :

1:39:15
Speaker 1 :and that resilience that's fascinating


1:39:15
Speaker 0 :again is a


1:39:18
Speaker 1 :key design principle and again i'm
 triple morphizing here but it's a key driving principle of howbiological systems work


1:39:25
Speaker 0 :they're first resilient and then
 anything else

1:39:29
Speaker 1 :and when you look at this incredible
 beauty of life from the most i don't know beautifuli don't know human genome maybe of
 humanity and all of the ideals that should come with itto the most terrifying genome like i
 don't know kovit-19 sarsko v2 and the current pandemicyou basically see this elegance as
 the epitome of clean design

1:39:54
Speaker 0 :but it's dirty it's a mess it's


1:39:59
Speaker 1 :

1:39:59
Speaker 0 :you know the the way to get there is
 hugely messy and that's something that

1:40:02
Speaker 1 :we as computer scientists


1:40:04
Speaker 0 :don't embrace we like to have clean code


1:40:08
Speaker 1 :you know as like in engineering they
 teach you about compartmentalization

1:40:12
Speaker 0 :about sort of separating functions about


1:40:14
Speaker 1 :

1:40:16
Speaker 0 :modularity about hierarchical design


1:40:18
Speaker 1 :none of that applies in bio testing
 [Laughter] testing sure yeah biology does plenty ofthat but
 i mean through evolutionary exploration but umif you look at biological systems first


1:40:32
Speaker 0 :they are robust and then they specialize


1:40:33
Speaker 1 :to become anything else
 and if you look at viruses the reason why they're so

1:40:39
Speaker 0 :elegant when you look at the design of


1:40:41
Speaker 1 :this you know
 genome it seems so elegant and the reason for that is that it's beenstripped down
 from something much larger because of the pressure to keep it compact

1:40:54
Speaker 0 :so many compact genomes out there have
 ancestors that were much larger

1:40:58
Speaker 1 :you don't start small and become big you
 go through a loop of add a bunch of stuff increase complexityand then
 you know slim it down and one of my early papers was in facton genome duplication one of the things
 we found is that baker's yeast which is theyou know yeast that you use to make
 bread but also the yeast that you use to make winewhich is basically the dominant species
 when you go in the fields of tuscany and you say you know what's out thereit's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae
 or the way my italian friends say saccharomycesso um uh which means what
 oh sakura okay i'm sorry i'm i'm greek so yeah zacharomickeys zacharo is sugar minky's is
 fungus yes cerevisiae cerveza beerso so it means the sugar fungus of beer
 yeah you know less less sounding to thestill poetic yeah so anyway uh
 saccharomyces cerevisiae basically the major baker's yeast out thereis the descendant of a whole genome


1:41:58
Speaker 0 :duplication
 why would a whole genuine duplication even happen when it happenedis coinciding with about 100 million


1:42:06
Speaker 1 :years ago
 and the emergence of

1:42:11
Speaker 0 :fruit-bearing plants
 why fruit-bearing plants because animals would eatthe fruit and would walk around and poop
 huge amounts of nutrients along with a

1:42:23
Speaker 1 :

1:42:23
Speaker 0 :seed
 for the plants to spread before that plants were not spreading through

1:42:28
Speaker 1 :animals they were spreading through wind
 and all kinds of other ways but basically the moment you havefruit-bearing plants
 the the the these plants are basically creating this abundance of sugar in theenvironment so there's an evolutionary


1:42:41
Speaker 0 :niche that gets created
 and in that evolutionary niche you

1:42:43
Speaker 1 :basically have enough sugar
 that a whole genome duplication which initially is a very messy eventallows you to then you know relieve some
 of that complexity

1:42:56
Speaker 0 :so to pause what does genome duplication
 mean that basically means that instead of

1:43:00
Speaker 1 :having eight chromosomes
 you can now have 16 chromosomes

1:43:05
Speaker 0 :so but with the duplication at first
 when you have six when you go to 16 you're not usingthat


1:43:14
Speaker 1 :oh yeah you are yeah so basically from
 one day to the next you went from having eight chromosomesto having 16 chromosomes


1:43:20
Speaker 0 :

1:43:20
Speaker 1 :probably a non-disjunction event during
 a duplication during a division so you basically divide the cell insteadof half the genome going this way and
 half the genome going the other way afterduplication of the genome you basically
 have all of it going to one cell and then there's a sufficient messinessthere that you end up with
 slight differences that make most of these chromosomes be actually preservedit's a long story short but it's a big


1:43:43
Speaker 0 :upgrade right so that's
 not necessarily because what happens

1:43:47
Speaker 1 :immediately thereafter is that you start
 massively losing tons of those duplicated genes so ninety

1:43:52
Speaker 0 :percent of those genes were actually
 lost very rapidly after holding duplication

1:43:57
Speaker 1 :and the reason for that is that
 biology is not intelligent it's just

1:44:03
Speaker 0 :ruthless selection random mutation


1:44:05
Speaker 1 :so the ruthless selection basically
 means that as soon as one of the random mutations hit one generuthless selection just kills off that
 gene it's just you know you you know if you have a pressure tomaintain a small compact genome
 you will very rapidly lose the second copy of most of your genesand a small number 10 were kept in two
 copies and those had to do a lot with environment adaptation with the speed ofreplication
 with the speed of translation and with sugar processingso i'm making a long story short to
 basically say that evolution is

1:44:37
Speaker 0 :messy the only way like so so


1:44:40
Speaker 1 :you know the example that i was giving
 of messing with 20

1:44:44
Speaker 0 :

1:44:44
Speaker 1 :of your bits in your computer totally
 bogus

1:44:47
Speaker 0 :

1:44:47
Speaker 1 :duplicating all your functions and just
 throwing them out there in the same you know function just totally boguslike this would never work in an
 engineer system but biological systems because of this

1:44:57
Speaker 0 :content-based indexing and because of
 this modularity that comes from the fact that

1:45:02
Speaker 1 :the gene is controlled by a series of
 tags and now if you need this gene in anothersetting you just add some more tags that
 will basically turn it on also in those settings so this gene is

1:45:12
Speaker 0 :now pressured
 to to do two different functions and it builds up complexityi see a whole term duplication and gene


1:45:21
Speaker 1 :duplication in general as a way to


1:45:23
Speaker 0 :relieve that complexity
 so you have this gradual buildup of

1:45:25
Speaker 1 :complexity as functions get
 past get sort of added on to the existing genesand then boom you duplicate your your
 workforce and you now have two copies of this geneone will probably specialize to do one
 and the other one will specialize to do the other or one will maintain theancestral function the other one will
 sort of be free to evolve and specialize whilelosing the ancestral functions
 and so forth so that's how genomes evolve they're they're just

1:45:51
Speaker 0 :messy things but they're extremely fault


1:45:52
Speaker 1 :tolerant
 and they're extremely able to deal with mutations because that'sthe very way that you generate new


1:46:02
Speaker 0 :

1:46:04
Speaker 1 :functions so new functionalization comes
 from the very thing that breaks it so even inthe current pandemic


1:46:08
Speaker 0 :many people are asking me which
 mutations matter the most and what i tell them is well we can

1:46:15
Speaker 1 :study the evolutionary dynamics of the
 current genome

1:46:17
Speaker 0 :to then understand which mutations have


1:46:21
Speaker 1 :

1:46:22
Speaker 0 :previously happened or not and
 which mutations happen in genes that

1:46:26
Speaker 1 :evolve rapidly or not
 and one of the things we found for example is thatthe genes that evolved rapidly in the


1:46:34
Speaker 0 :past are still evolving rapidly now in
 the current pandemic

1:46:38
Speaker 1 :the genes have evolved slowly in the
 past are still evolving slowly

1:46:41
Speaker 0 :which means that they're useful which


1:46:43
Speaker 1 :means that they're
 under the same evolutionary pressures

1:46:46
Speaker 0 :but then the question


1:46:48
Speaker 1 :is what happens in specific mutations
 so if you look at the d614 gene mutation that's been all over the news soin position 614 in the amino acids and
 harvest 14 of the s protein there's ad to g mutation that that sort of has
 creeped over the population mutation

1:47:08
Speaker 0 :we found out through my work disrupts a
 perfectly conserved nucleotide position that has never been changed in thehistory of


1:47:16
Speaker 1 :millions of years of equivalent
 mammalian evolution

1:47:20
Speaker 0 :of these viruses that basically means
 that it's a completely new adaptation to human and that mutation has now gone

1:47:28
Speaker 1 :from
 one percent frequency to 90 frequency in almost all outbreaks

1:47:34
Speaker 0 :so this mutation i like how you say in
 the mu the 416 what was it okay yes 6 on 14 sorry614 right that


1:47:42
Speaker 1 :d614g dc so so literally


1:47:44
Speaker 0 :so what you're saying is it's like a
 chess move yeah so it's just mutated one letter to anotherexactly and that hasn't happened before
 yeah and and this somehow this mutation is really useful

1:47:57
Speaker 1 :uh it's really useful in the current
 environment of the genome which is moving from human to human when

1:48:03
Speaker 0 :

1:48:05
Speaker 1 :it was moving from bad to bad
 it couldn't care less for that mutation but it's environment specific so nowthat it's moving from human to human
 whoo-hoo it's moving way better like by orders of magnetism what do you okay so

1:48:16
Speaker 0 :so you're like tracking this
 evolutionary dynamics which is fascinating but what do you dowith that
 so what does that mean what does this mean what do you makewhat do you make of this mutation in uh
 trying to anticipate i guess is is the is one of the things you'retrying to do is anticipate
 where how this unrolls into the future this thisevolutionary dynamics such a great


1:48:40
Speaker 1 :question so so there's there's two
 things remember when i was saying earliermutation is the path
 to new things but also the path to break

1:48:47
Speaker 0 :

1:48:48
Speaker 1 :old things
 so what we know is that this position

1:48:52
Speaker 0 :

1:48:52
Speaker 1 :was extremely preserved


1:48:55
Speaker 0 :

1:48:55
Speaker 1 :through gazillions of mutations that
 mutation was never tolerated when it was moving from best to batsso that basically means that that
 contain that position is extremely importantin the function of that protein that's
 the first thing it tells the second one is thatthat position was very well suited to


1:49:10
Speaker 0 :

1:49:11
Speaker 1 :bat transmission but now
 is not well suited to human transmission so it got rid of it and it now has a newversion
 of that amino acid that basically makes it much easier to transmit from human tohuman
 so in terms of the evolutionary history teaching us aboutthe future
 it basically tells us here's the regions that are

1:49:32
Speaker 0 :currently mutating here's the regions


1:49:35
Speaker 1 :that are most likely to imitate going
 forward as you're building a vaccine here's whatyou should be focusing on
 in terms of the most stable regions that are the least likely to mutateor here's the newly evolved functions
 that are most likely to be important because they've overcome this localmaximum that it had reached in the in
 the bat transmission so anyway it's atangent to basically say that


1:50:02
Speaker 0 :evolution works in messy ways and the
 thing that you would break is the

1:50:08
Speaker 1 :thing that actually allows you to first
 go through a lull and then reaching new local maximumand i often like to say that if


1:50:18
Speaker 0 :engineers


1:50:19
Speaker 1 :had basically designed evolution we


1:50:21
Speaker 0 :would still be


1:50:23
Speaker 1 :

1:50:24
Speaker 0 :perfectly replicating bacteria


1:50:26
Speaker 1 :because it's by making the bacterium


1:50:29
Speaker 0 :worse that you allow evolution to reach


1:50:30
Speaker 1 :a new


1:50:32
Speaker 0 :optimum that's just a pause on that
 that's so profound the the that's so profound for theentirety of um
 this scientific and engineering disciplinesexactly we as engineers need to embrace
 breaking things we as engineers need to embracerobustness as the first principle
 beyond perfection because nothing is

1:50:54
Speaker 1 :going to ever be perfect


1:50:56
Speaker 0 :and when you're sending a satellite to
 mars when something goes wrong it'll break down as opposed to building

1:51:02
Speaker 1 :

1:51:03
Speaker 0 :systems that tolerate failure
 and are resilient to that

1:51:07
Speaker 1 :and in fact get better through that so


1:51:11
Speaker 0 :the spacex approach versus nasa


1:51:15
Speaker 1 :for the for example


1:51:16
Speaker 0 :is there something we can learn about
 the incredible uh take lessons from the incrediblebiological systems in their resilience
 in their in the mushiness the messiness to uhto our computing systems to uh to our
 computers it would basically be starting from

1:51:32
Speaker 1 :scratch in many ways


1:51:34
Speaker 0 :it would basically be building new


1:51:36
Speaker 1 :paradigms
 that don't try to get the right answer all the timebut try to get the right answer most of
 the time or a lot of the time

1:51:46
Speaker 0 :do you see deep learning systems in the
 whole world of machine learning is kind of taking a step in that direction

1:51:52
Speaker 1 :absolutely absolutely basically by
 allowing this much more natural evolution ofthese parameters you basically and then
 if you look at sort of deep learning systems againthey're not inspired by the genome
 aspect of biology they're inspired by the brain aspect of biology

1:52:09
Speaker 0 :and again i want you to pause for a
 second and realize the complexity of the entirehuman brain
 with trillions of connections within our you know neurons

1:52:22
Speaker 1 :

1:52:23
Speaker 0 :with millions of cells talking to each
 other is still encoded within that same genome

1:52:30
Speaker 1 :that same genome encodes every single


1:52:33
Speaker 0 :freaking cell type
 of the entire body every single cell is encoded by the same codeand yet specialization
 allows you to have this single viral-like genome that self-replicatesthe single module modular automaton
 work with other copies of itself it's mind-bogglingcreate complex organs through which
 blood flows and what is that blood the same freakinggenome
 create organs that communicate with each otherand what are these organs the exact same
 genome create a brain that is innervatedby massive amounts of blood pumping
 energy to it 20 of our energetic needsto the brain from the same genome and
 all of the neuronal connections all of the auxiliary cells all of theimmune cells
 the astrocytes the ligand size the

1:53:34
Speaker 1 :neurons the excitatory the inhibitory
 neurons all of the different classes of

1:53:38
Speaker 0 :parasites
 the blood-brain barrier all of that same genomeone way to see that in a sad
 so this one is beautiful the sad thing is thinking about the trillionsof organisms that died to create that


1:53:55
Speaker 1 :you mean on the evolutionary path and


1:53:57
Speaker 0 :the evolutionary path to humans
 that's crazy there's two descendants of apes justtalking on the podcast okay this is


1:54:06
Speaker 1 :so mind-boggling just just to boggle our
 minds a little bit more yeah us talking to each other

1:54:12
Speaker 0 :we are basically generating a series of


1:54:16
Speaker 1 :vocal utterances
 through our pulsating of vocal chords received through this the people who

1:54:24
Speaker 0 :

1:54:25
Speaker 1 :listen to this are taking a completely
 different path to that information transfer yet

1:54:30
Speaker 0 :through language
 but imagine if we could connect these brainsdirectly to each other the


1:54:39
Speaker 1 :amount of information that i'm
 condensing into a small number of words

1:54:43
Speaker 0 :is a huge funnel which then you receive
 and you expand into a huge number of thoughtsfrom that small funnel
 in many ways engineers would love to have the whole information transfer

1:54:59
Speaker 1 :just take the whole set of neurons and
 throw them away i mean throw them to the other person

1:55:05
Speaker 0 :this might actually not be better


1:55:07
Speaker 1 :because in
 your misinterpretation of every word that i'm saying

1:55:12
Speaker 0 :you are creating new interpretation that


1:55:14
Speaker 1 :might actually be way better than what i


1:55:17
Speaker 0 :meant to the first place
 the ambiguity of language perhaps

1:55:22
Speaker 1 :

1:55:23
Speaker 0 :might be the secret to creativity


1:55:25
Speaker 1 :every single time you work on a project
 by yourself

1:55:27
Speaker 0 :

1:55:29
Speaker 1 :you only bounce ideas with one person
 and your neurons are basically fullycognizant of what these ideas are
 but the moment you interact with another person themisinterpretations that happen might be
 the most creative part of the process with my students every time we have aresearch meeting i very often pause and
 say

1:55:47
Speaker 0 :let me repeat what you just said in a
 different way and i sort of go on and

1:55:50
Speaker 1 :brainstorm
 with what they were saying but by the

1:55:54
Speaker 0 :third time
 it's not what they were saying at all and when they pick up what i'm sayingyou're like oh


1:56:00
Speaker 1 :well now they they've sort of learned
 something very different from what i was

1:56:05
Speaker 0 :saying and that is the same kind of
 messiness that i'm describing in the

1:56:09
Speaker 1 :genome itself


1:56:10
Speaker 0 :it's sort of embracing the messiness and
 that's a feature not a book

1:56:15
Speaker 1 :exactly and in the same way when you're
 thinking about sort of these deep learning systemsthat will allow us to sort of be more
 creative perhaps or learn better approximations of thesecomplex functions
 again tuned to the universe that we inhabit

1:56:30
Speaker 0 :you have to embrace the breaking you
 have to embrace the

1:56:34
Speaker 1 :you know how do we get out of these
 local optima and a lot of the

1:56:37
Speaker 0 :

1:56:38
Speaker 1 :design paradigms that have made deep
 learning so successful

1:56:43
Speaker 0 :are ways to get away from that ways to


1:56:44
Speaker 1 :get
 better training by sort of sending long

1:56:48
Speaker 0 :

1:56:49
Speaker 1 :range messages
 these lstm models and the you know sort of feed forward loops thatyou know sort of jump through layers of
 a convolutional neural network all of these things are basically ways

1:57:02
Speaker 0 :to push you out of this local
 maxima and that's sort of what evolution

1:57:07
Speaker 1 :does that's what language does that's
 what

1:57:10
Speaker 0 :conversation and brainstorming does
 that's what our brain does

1:57:14
Speaker 1 :so you know this design paradigm is
 something that's pervasive

1:57:17
Speaker 0 :and yet not taught in schools not taught
 in engineering schools

1:57:22
Speaker 1 :where everything is minutely modularized
 to make sure that we never deviate from you know whatever signal we're trying toemit
 as opposed to let all hell breaks loose because that's the way that's the pathof paradise


1:57:34
Speaker 0 :the path to paradise yeah i mean it's
 difficult to know how to teach that and uh what to do with it i mean it's umit's difficult to know how to build up a
 sign the scientific method around messiness you i mean

1:57:47
Speaker 1 :it's not all messiness we need we need
 some cleanness and going back to the example with marsthat's probably the place where i want
 to sort of moderate error as much as possible and sort ofcontrol the environment as much as
 possible but if you're trying to repopulate marswell maybe messiness is a good thing
 then

1:58:05
Speaker 0 :on that uh you quick you quickly
 mentioned this in terms of us using our vocal cords to speak on apodcast
 um so elon musk and neurolink are working ontrying to plug
 as per discussion with computers and biological systemsto connect the two he's trying to con
 connect our brain to a computer to create a brain computerinterface where they can
 communicate back and forth on this line of thinking do you think this is uhpossible to bridge the gap between our
 engineered computing systems and the messy biological systemsmy answer would be absolutely we


1:58:52
Speaker 1 :you know there's no doubt that we can
 understand more and more about what goes on in the brainand we can sort of train the brain
 i mean i don't know if you remember the

1:59:01
Speaker 0 :palm pilot
 yeah palm pilot yeah remember this whole

1:59:05
Speaker 1 :

1:59:06
Speaker 0 :sort of alphabet that they had created
 am i thinking of the same thing um it's

1:59:10
Speaker 1 :basically you had you had a little pen
 and for every character you had a little scribblethat was unique that the machine could
 understand and that instead of trying the machine trying to

1:59:21
Speaker 0 :

1:59:23
Speaker 1 :teach the machine to recognize human
 characters you had basically they figured out thatit's better and easier
 to train humans to create human-like

1:59:30
Speaker 0 :

1:59:31
Speaker 1 :characters that the machine is better at
 recognizing so

1:59:35
Speaker 0 :in the same way i think what will happen


1:59:37
Speaker 1 :is that humans will be trained to be
 able to create the mind pattern that the machine willrespond to
 before the machine truly comprehends our thoughts so thefirst human brain interfaces will be
 tricking humans to speak the machine languagewhere with the right set of electrodes i
 can sort of trick my brain into doing thisand this is the same way that many
 people teach like learn to control artificial limbsyou basically try a bunch of stuff and
 eventually you figure out how your limbs work

2:00:07
Speaker 0 :that might not be very different from


2:00:08
Speaker 1 :how humans learn to use their
 natural limbs when they first grow up basically you have theseyou know neoteny period of
 you know this puddle of soup inside your braintrying to figure out how to even make
 your own connections before you're born and then learning sounds in utero ofyou know all kinds of echoes and
 you know eventually getting out in the real world andi don't know if you've seen newborns but
 they just stare around a lot you know one way to think about this asa machine learning person is oh they're
 just training their edge detectors and eventually they figure out how totrain their edge detectors they work
 through the second layer of the visual cortex and the third layer and so forth

2:00:53
Speaker 0 :

2:00:54
Speaker 1 :and you basically have this
 um learning how to control your limbs that probably comes at the same timeyou're sort of you know throwing random
 things there and you realize that oh wow when i do this thing

2:01:06
Speaker 0 :my limb moves let's do the following


2:01:09
Speaker 1 :experiment take a breath
 what muscles did you flex now take another breath and think what muscles doi flex


2:01:16
Speaker 0 :the first thing that you're thinking
 when you're taking a breath

2:01:20
Speaker 1 :is the impact that he has on your lungs
 you're like oh i'm now going to increase my lungs or i'm not going to bring airin
 but what you're actually doing is just

2:01:26
Speaker 0 :changing your diaphragm yeah
 that's not conscious of course you never think of the diaphragm as a thingyeah and why is that that's probably the
 same reason why i think of moving my

2:01:38
Speaker 1 :finger when i actually move my finger


2:01:39
Speaker 0 :i think of the effect instead of


2:01:42
Speaker 1 :actually thinking of whatever muscle is


2:01:42
Speaker 0 :twitching


2:01:45
Speaker 1 :that actually causes my finger to move
 so we basically in our first years of

2:01:48
Speaker 0 :life
 build up this massive lookup table

2:01:52
Speaker 1 :between whatever neuronal firing we do


2:01:55
Speaker 0 :and whatever action happens
 in our body that we control

2:02:01
Speaker 1 :if you have a kid grow up with a third
 limb

2:02:03
Speaker 0 :

2:02:04
Speaker 1 :i'm sure they'll figure out how to
 control them probably at the same rate

2:02:07
Speaker 0 :as their natural limbs
 and uh a lot of the work would be done by theso if the third limb is the computer you
 kind of have a uh not a faith but a thought thatum the brain might be able to figure out
 like if the plasticity would come from the brain yeah like the brain would becleverer than the machine at first when
 i talk about a third limb that's exactly

2:02:29
Speaker 1 :what i'm saying
 an artificial limb that basically just controls your mouse while you're typingyou know perfectly natural thing i mean


2:02:36
Speaker 0 :

2:02:36
Speaker 1 :again you know in a few hundred years
 maybe sooner than that but but basically there's

2:02:43
Speaker 0 :as long as the machine is consistent in


2:02:46
Speaker 1 :the way that it will respond
 to your brain impulses you'll figure out

2:02:49
Speaker 0 :

2:02:50
Speaker 1 :how to control that
 and you could play tennis with your

2:02:53
Speaker 0 :third limb and
 let me go back to consistency people who havedramatic accidents that basically take
 out a whole chunk of their brain can be taught to co-opt other parts of

2:03:06
Speaker 1 :the brain to then control that part
 you can basically build up that tissue

2:03:10
Speaker 0 :again and eventually train your body
 how to walk again and how to read again and how to play again and how to thinkagain how to speak a language again etc


2:03:18
Speaker 1 :so there's a massive amount of


2:03:19
Speaker 0 :malleability
 that happens you know naturally in

2:03:25
Speaker 1 :our way of controlling our body our
 brain or thoughts or vocal cords or limbs etc andhuman machine interfaces are inevitable
 if we sort of figure out how to read these electric impulsesbut the resolution at which we can


2:03:42
Speaker 0 :understand human thought
 right now is nil is ridiculous

2:03:45
Speaker 1 :so how are human thoughts encoded it's
 basically combinations

2:03:52
Speaker 0 :of neurons that co-fire and these create


2:03:54
Speaker 1 :these things called
 engrams that eventually form memories and so so forth

2:03:58
Speaker 0 :we know nothing of all that stuff
 so before we can actually read into your brain that you want to build a program

2:04:06
Speaker 1 :that does this anytime it's on that
 we need a lot of neuroscience well so

2:04:11
Speaker 0 :uh to push back on that do you think
 it's possible that without understanding the functionallyabout the brain or the from the
 neuroscience or the cognitive science or psychology whichever level of the brainwill look at do you think if we just
 connect connect them just like per your previouspoint
 if we just have a high enough resolution between connection betweenuh wikipedia and your brain the brain
 will just figure it out with us understanding um because that'sone of the
 innovations of neural link is they're increasing the number ofconnections to the brain to like several
 thousand which before was you know in the dozens or whatever

2:04:48
Speaker 1 :you're still off by a few orders of
 magnets

2:04:54
Speaker 0 :right but the the thing is the hope is
 if you increase that number more and more and moremaybe you don't need to understand
 anything about the actual how human thought is represented in thebrain you could just
 let it let it figure it out by itself

2:05:08
Speaker 1 :well uh cannery is waking up and saying
 i know

2:05:10
Speaker 0 :yeah exactly exactly so


2:05:12
Speaker 1 :yeah sure you don't have faith in the


2:05:15
Speaker 0 :plasticity of the brain to that degree


2:05:18
Speaker 1 :it's not about brain plasticity it's
 about the input aspect basically i think on the output aspectbeing able to control a machine
 is something that you can probably train your neural impulsesthat you're sending out to sort of match
 whatever response you see in the environment ifthis thing moved every single time i
 thought a particular thought then i could figure out i could hack myway into moving this thing with just a
 series of thoughts i could think

2:05:43
Speaker 0 :guitar piano tennis ball


2:05:43
Speaker 1 :and then this thing would be moving and
 then you know i would just have the series ofthoughts that would sort of result in
 the impulses that will move this thing the way that i want it and theneventually it'll become natural because
 i won't even think about it um i mean the same way that we controlour limbs in a very natural way
 but babies don't do that babies have to figure it outand you know some of it is hard-coded
 but some of that is actually learned based on the whatever soup of neuronsyou ended up with whatever connections
 you pruned them to and eventually you were born withyou know a lot of that is coded in the
 genome but a huge chunk of that is stochasticinstead of the way that you sort of
 create all these neurons they migrate they form connections they sort ofyou know spread out they have particular
 branching patterns but then the connectivity itselfunique in every single new person all
 this to say that on the output side absolutely i'm very very you know umhopeful that we can have machines that
 read thousands of these neuronal connectionson the output side but on the input side
 oh boy i don't expect any time in the nearfuture we'll be able to sort of send a
 series of impulses that will tell me oh earth to sun distance 7.5 millionet cetera like nowhere i mean i think
 language will still the be the input way rather than sort of anykind of more complex


2:07:07
Speaker 0 :it's a really interesting notion that
 the ambiguity of language is a feature yeahand we evolved for millions of years
 to uh to take advantage of that ambiguity exactly

2:07:20
Speaker 1 :

2:07:20
Speaker 0 :and yet no one teaches us the subtle
 differences between words that are near cognates and yetevoke so much more
 than you know one from the other and yet you know when you're choosing words from

2:07:34
Speaker 1 :

2:07:35
Speaker 0 :a list of 20 synonyms
 you know exactly the connotation of every single one of them and that'ssomething that


2:07:42
Speaker 1 :you know is there so so yes there's
 ambiguity but there's all kinds of connotations

2:07:46
Speaker 0 :and in the way that we select our words
 we have so much baggage that we're sending along the way that we're

2:07:51
Speaker 1 :emoting the way that we're moving our
 hands every single time we speak the you know the pauses the eye contact

2:07:57
Speaker 0 :etc so much higher baud rate than just a


2:08:01
Speaker 1 :vocal
 you know string of characters well let

2:08:04
Speaker 0 :me
 just take a small tangent on that oh

2:08:07
Speaker 1 :tangent we haven't done that yet and i
 haven't done an idea

2:08:12
Speaker 0 :uh we'll return to the origin of life
 so i mean you're greek but i'm i'm going on thispersonal journey uh i'm going to paris
 for the explicit purpose of talking to one of the most famous uh acouple who's a famous translators of
 russian literature dostoyevsky tolstoy yeah and they gothat's their art is the translation and
 um everything i've learned about the translation artit makes me feel um
 it's so profound in a way that's so much more profound than the naturallanguage processing papers i read in the
 machine learning community that there's such depth to languagethat um i don't know what to do with i
 don't know if you've experienced that in your own lifewith knowing multiple languages um
 i don't know what to i don't know how to make sense of it but there's so muchloss in translation between russian and
 english and getting a sense of that like forexample
 there's like just taking a single sentence from dostoyevskyand like there's a lot of them you could
 you could talk for hours about how to translate thatsentence properly
 uh that captures the meaning the the the periodthe culture the humor the wit the
 suffering that was in the context of the time all ofthat it could be a single sentence uh
 you could you could talk forever about what it takes to translate thatcorrectly i don't know what to do with
 that

2:09:49
Speaker 1 :so being greek it's very hard for me to
 think of a sentence or even a word without goinginto the full etymology of that word
 breaking up every single atom of that that sentence and every single atomof these words
 and rebuilding it back up i have three kidsand the way that i teach them greek is
 the same way that you know the documentary i was mentioning earlierabout sort of understanding the deep
 roots of all of these you know words um

2:10:23
Speaker 0 :and it's very


2:10:27
Speaker 1 :it's very interesting that every single
 time i hear a new word that i've never heard before

2:10:32
Speaker 0 :i go and figure out the etymology of
 that word because i will never

2:10:35
Speaker 1 :appreciate that word
 without understanding how it was initially formed

2:10:39
Speaker 0 :interesting but how does that help
 because that's that's not the full picture

2:10:44
Speaker 1 :no no of course of course but what i'm
 trying to say is that knowing the

2:10:47
Speaker 0 :components


2:10:48
Speaker 1 :teaches you about the context of the
 formation of that word

2:10:51
Speaker 0 :and sort of the original usage of that


2:10:54
Speaker 1 :word and then of course the word takes
 new meaning as you create it you know from its parts

2:11:01
Speaker 0 :and that meaning then gets augmented
 and two synonyms that that sort of have

2:11:05
Speaker 1 :different roots


2:11:08
Speaker 0 :will actually have implications that
 carry a lot of that baggage

2:11:11
Speaker 1 :of the historical provenance of these
 words so before working on genome evolutionmy passion was evolution of language


2:11:20
Speaker 0 :and sort of tracing cognates across
 different languages

2:11:25
Speaker 1 :through their etymologies and that's


2:11:28
Speaker 0 :fascinating that there's parallels
 between i mean of course the idea that there'sevolutionary dynamics to our language
 yeah every single word that you utter parallels parallels what doesparallels mean
 para means side by side alleles from alleleswhich means identical twins parallels
 i mean name any word and there's so much baggageso much beauty in how that word came to
 be and how this word took a new meaning than the sum of its partsyeah and that and those and they're just
 they're just words they don't have any physical

2:12:08
Speaker 1 :exactly and now you take your words and


2:12:10
Speaker 0 :you weave them
 into a sentence the emotional invocations of that weaving arefathomless and they're all all of those
 emotions all live in our in the brains of humansin the eye of the beholder


2:12:28
Speaker 1 :no seriously you have to embrace this


2:12:29
Speaker 0 :

2:12:31
Speaker 1 :concept of the eye of the beholder


2:12:32
Speaker 0 :it's it's the the conceptualization that
 nothing takes meaning with one person creating it everything takes meaningin the receiving end and the emergent


2:12:43
Speaker 1 :properties
 of these communication networks where

2:12:46
Speaker 0 :

2:12:48
Speaker 1 :every single you know if you look at the
 network of our cells and how they're communicating with each other

2:12:52
Speaker 0 :every cell has its own code this code is
 modulated by the epigenome this creates a bunch of different celltypes each cell type now has its own
 identity yet they all have the common root of thestem cells that sort of
 led to them each of these identities is now communicating with each otherthey take meaning in their interaction
 there's an emergent property that comes

2:13:13
Speaker 1 :from a bunch of cells being together


2:13:15
Speaker 0 :that is not in any one of the parts if


2:13:18
Speaker 1 :you look at neurons communicating again


2:13:19
Speaker 0 :these
 engrams don't exist in any one neuron they exist in the connection in thecombination of neurons
 and the meaning of the words that i'm

2:13:27
Speaker 1 :

2:13:29
Speaker 0 :telling you
 is empty until it reaches you and it affects you in a very different waythen it affects whoever's listening to
 this conversation now because of the emotional baggage thati've grown up with that you've grown up
 with and that they've grown up with yeah and that's i think the magic oftranslation
 if you start thinking of translation as

2:13:49
Speaker 1 :

2:13:50
Speaker 0 :

2:13:52
Speaker 1 :just simply capturing that emotional


2:13:53
Speaker 0 :set of reactions that you have that you


2:13:56
Speaker 1 :evoke


2:13:59
Speaker 0 :you need a different set of words to
 evoke that same set of reactions to a french personthan to a russian person because of the
 baggage of the culture that we grew up inyeah i mean there's so so basically you


2:14:09
Speaker 1 :shouldn't find


2:14:12
Speaker 0 :the best word sometimes it's a
 completely different sentence structure that you will needmatched to the cultural context
 of the target audience that you have yeah the it's i meanyou're just i usually don't think about
 this but right now there's this feeling as a reminder thatit's just you and i talking
 but there's several hundred thousand people will listen to thisthere's some guy in russia right now
 running uh like in moscow listening to usand there's somebody in india i
 guarantee you there's somebody in china and south america there's somebodyin texas and and they all have different
 emotional baggage they probably got

2:14:54
Speaker 1 :angry earlier on about the whole


2:14:56
Speaker 0 :discussion about coronavirus and
 uh about some aspect of it uh yeah it's and there's that network effect yeahyeah
 that's uh it's a beautiful thing and and

2:15:07
Speaker 1 :this lateral transfer of information


2:15:09
Speaker 0 :that's what makes the collective


2:15:11
Speaker 1 :quote-unquote genome


2:15:13
Speaker 0 :of humanity so unique from any other
 species so you somehow miraculously wrapped itback to the very beginning
 of when we were talking about the human the beauty of the human genomeso i think this is the right time unless
 we want to go for a six to eight hour conversation we'regonna have to talk again but
 i think for now to wrap it up um this is the right time to talk aboutthe uh the biggest most ridiculous
 question of all meaning of life off mike you mentionedto me that you um
 you had your 42nd birthday 40 a second being a very special absurdlyspecial number
 uh and you had to kind of um get together with friends to discuss themeaning of life so let me ask you
 in your as a biologist as a computer scientistand as a human
 what is the meaning of life i've been

2:16:16
Speaker 1 :asking this question
 for a long time ever since my 42nd birthdaybut well before that and even planning
 the meaning of life symposium

2:16:26
Speaker 0 :and symposium


2:16:27
Speaker 1 :means together posey actually means to
 drink together so symposium is actually a drinking party[Laughter]
 so can you actually elaborate about this

2:16:36
Speaker 0 :meaning of life that you put together


2:16:39
Speaker 1 :it's like the most genius idea i've ever
 heard so 42 is obviously the answer to life theuniverse and everything from the
 hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and as i was turning 42 i've had thetheme for every one of my birthdays when
 i was turning 32 it's one zero zero zero zero zero inbinary
 so i celebrated my 100 000th binary binary birthday and i had a theme ofgoing back 100 000 years
 you know let's dress something in the last hundred thousand yearsanyway it was we've i've always had
 these that's such an interesting human being

2:17:10
Speaker 0 :okay that's awesome i've always had


2:17:13
Speaker 1 :these sort of
 uh sort of numerology [Music]related announcements for my for my
 birthday party so what came out of thatmeaning of life symposium is that i
 basically asked 42 of my colleagues 42 my friends 42 of myyou know collaborators to basically give
 seven minute species on the meaning of life each from theirperspective and
 i really encourage you to go there because it's mind-boggling that everysingle person
 said a different answer every single person started withi don't know what the meaning of life is
 but and then give this beautifully eloquently answer eloquent answer

2:17:57
Speaker 0 :and they were all different but they all
 were consistent with each other and mutually synergistic

2:18:03
Speaker 1 :and together forming a beautiful view of
 what it means to be human in many ways

2:18:07
Speaker 0 :

2:18:08
Speaker 1 :some people talked about the loss of


2:18:10
Speaker 0 :their loved one
 their life partner for many many years and how their life changed through that

2:18:15
Speaker 1 :some people talked about the origin of


2:18:18
Speaker 0 :life some people talked about


2:18:20
Speaker 1 :the difference between purpose and


2:18:22
Speaker 0 :meaning


2:18:24
Speaker 1 :i'll you know maybe quote one of the
 answers which is this linguistics uh professorfriend of mine at harvard


2:18:34
Speaker 0 :who basically said


2:18:36
Speaker 1 :that she was gonna she's greek as well
 and she said i will give a very pythian answer so pithia was the oracle ofdelphi
 who would basically give these very cryptic answers very short butinterpretable in many different ways
 there was this whole set of priests who were tasked withinterpreting what pethia had said
 and very often you would not get a clean interpretation but she saidi will be like pethi and give you a very
 short and multiple interpretable answer butunlike her i will actually also give you
 three interpretations

2:19:06
Speaker 0 :and she said the answer to the meaning
 of life is become one

2:19:13
Speaker 1 :and the first interpretation is like a


2:19:14
Speaker 0 :child
 become one year old with the excitement of discovering everything about theworld
 second interpretation in whatever you take onbecome one the first the best excel
 drive yourself to perfection for every one of your tasksand become one when people
 are separate become one come together

2:19:41
Speaker 1 :learn to understand each other


2:19:44
Speaker 0 :damn that's an answer and one way to


2:19:45
Speaker 1 :summarize this whole meaning of life
 symposium is that the very symposium was

2:19:50
Speaker 0 :illustrating
 the quest for meaning which might itself bethe meaning of life this constant quest


2:20:01
Speaker 1 :for something sublime something human


2:20:02
Speaker 0 :something intangible some you know


2:20:05
Speaker 1 :aspect of what defines us as a species


2:20:08
Speaker 0 :and as an individual both the quest of
 me as a person through my own life but the meaning of life could also bethe meaning of all of life
 what is the whole point of life why life why life itself

2:20:24
Speaker 1 :because we've been talking about the


2:20:27
Speaker 0 :history and evolution of life
 but we haven't talked about why life in the first place is life inevitableis life part of physics
 does life transcend physics but fighting by fighting against entropyby compartmentalizing and increasing
 concentrations rather than diluting away

2:20:47
Speaker 1 :is life um a distinct entity in the


2:20:49
Speaker 0 :universe


2:20:52
Speaker 1 :beyond the traditional very simple
 physical rules that govern gravity and you know electromagnetism and all ofthese forces
 is life another force is there a life force is there a uniquekind of set of principles that emerge of
 course built on top of the hardware of physics but is it sort of a new layerof software
 or a new layer of a computer system so that's at the levelof you know big questions there's
 another aspect of gratitude of basically

2:21:22
Speaker 0 :

2:21:24
Speaker 1 :what i you know what i like to say is
 during this pandemic i've basically worked from 6 a.m until 7 00 pm

2:21:30
Speaker 0 :every single day non-stop including


2:21:32
Speaker 1 :saturday and sunday
 i've basically broken all boundaries of where lifepersonal life begins and work life you
 know ends and uh that has been exhilarating for mejust just the intellectual pleasure


2:21:48
Speaker 0 :

2:21:51
Speaker 1 :that i get from a day of exhaustion
 where at the end of the day my brain is hurting i'm telling my wifewow i was useful today


2:21:59
Speaker 0 :

2:22:01
Speaker 1 :and there's a certain


2:22:03
Speaker 0 :pleasure that comes from feeling useful
 and there's a certain pleasure that comes from feeling gratefulso i've written this little sort of
 prayer for my kids to say at bedtime everynight
 where they basically say thank you god forall you have given me and give me the
 strength to give unto others with the same lovethat you have given unto me
 we as a species are so special the only ones who worry about themeaning of life
 and maybe that's what makes us human and what i like to say to my wife and tomy students during this pandemic


2:22:50
Speaker 1 :work extravaganza is


2:22:52
Speaker 0 :every now and then they ask me but how
 do you do this and i'm like i'm a workaholici love this this is me
 in the most unfiltered way the ability to do somethinguseful to feel that my brain is being
 used to interact with the smartest people onthe planet
 day in day out and to help them discover aspects of the human genomeof the human brain of human disease and
 the human condition that no one has seen beforewith data that we're capturing that
 has never been observed and there's another aspectwhich is on the personal life many
 people say oh i'm not going to have kids why botheri can tell you as a father
 they're missing half the picture if not the whole pictureteaching my kids about my view of the
 world and watching through their eyes thenaivete with which they start
 and the sophistication with which they end upthey understanding that they have of not
 just the natural world around them but of me toothe unfiltered criticism
 that you get from your own children that knows no boundsof honesty and i've grown
 components of my heart that i didn't know i haduntil you sense that fragility
 that vulnerability of the children that immense love and passionthe unfiltered egoism that we as adults
 learn how to hide so much better it's justthis back of emotions that
 tell me about the raw materials that make a human beingand how these raw materials can be
 arranged with more sophistication that

2:24:56
Speaker 1 :we learn through life


2:24:57
Speaker 0 :to become truly human adults
 but there's something so beautiful about seeing that progression between themthe complexity of the language growing
 as more neural connections are formed

2:25:15
Speaker 1 :to to realize that the hardware is


2:25:16
Speaker 0 :getting rearranged
 as their software is getting implemented on that hardwarethat their frontal cortex continues to
 grow for another 10 years these neuronal connections are

2:25:29
Speaker 1 :continuing to form new neurons that
 actually get

2:25:31
Speaker 0 :replicated and formed and it's it's just
 incredible that we have this not just you grow the hardware for 30 years and

2:25:39
Speaker 1 :then you feed it all of the knowledge no


2:25:42
Speaker 0 :no the knowledge is fed throughout and
 is shaping these neural connections as they're formingso seeing that transformation from
 either your own blood or from an adopted child isthe most beautiful thing you can do as a
 human being and it completes you it completes thatpath that journey
 the create life oh sure that's at conception that's easybut create human life to add the human
 part that takes decades of compassionof sharing of love and of anger
 and of impatience and patience and as a parenti think i've become a very different
 kind of teacher because again i'm a professor my first

2:26:26
Speaker 1 :role is to bring


2:26:29
Speaker 0 :adult human beings into a you know more
 mature level of adulthood where they learn not just to do sciencebut they learn
 the process of discovery and the process of collaboration the process of sharingthe process of
 conveying the knowledge of encapsulating something incredibly complex and and

2:26:48
Speaker 1 :sort of giving it up


2:26:49
Speaker 0 :in sort of bite-sized chunks that the
 rest of humanity can appreciate i tell my students all the time if youyou know


2:26:58
Speaker 1 :like when an apple fall when when when a
 tree falls in the forest and no one's there to listen has it really fallen

2:27:03
Speaker 0 :the same way you do this awesome
 research if you write an impenetrable paper that no one will understandit's as if you never did the awesome


2:27:10
Speaker 1 :research so conveying of knowledge


2:27:11
Speaker 0 :conveying


2:27:14
Speaker 1 :this lateral transfer that i was talking
 about at the very beginning

2:27:16
Speaker 0 :

2:27:18
Speaker 1 :of sort of human humanity and sort of
 the sharing of information

2:27:22
Speaker 0 :all of that has gotten so much
 more rich by seeing human beings grow in my own home because thatthat makes me a better parent and that
 makes me a better teacher and a better mentor to the nurturing

2:27:40
Speaker 1 :of my adult children which are my


2:27:41
Speaker 0 :

2:27:43
Speaker 1 :research group first of all
 beautifully put connects

2:27:46
Speaker 0 :beautifully to the vertical and the
 horizontal inheritance of ideas that we've talkedabout at the very beginning
 i don't think there's a better way to end it uh on this poeticand powerful note uh manolas thank you
 so much for talking there's a huge honor we have to talk againabout the origin of life about
 epigenetics epigenomics and uh some of the incredible research you'redoing truly an honor thanks so much for
 talking

2:28:15
Speaker 1 :thank you such a pleasure it's such a
 pleasure i mean your questions are outstanding i've had such a blast herei can't wait to be back awesome thanks
