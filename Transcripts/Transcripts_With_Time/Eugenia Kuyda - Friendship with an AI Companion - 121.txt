Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 eugenia cuida co-founder of replica which is an appthat allows you to make friends
 with an artificial intelligence system a chatbotthat learns to connect with you on an
 emotional you can even say a human level by beinga friend
 for those of you who know my interest in ai and views on life in generalknow that replica and eugenia's line of
 work is near and dear to my heart the originstory of replica is grounded in a
 personal tragedy of eugenia losing her close friend romanmazarenki
 who was killed crossing the street by a hit-and-run driverin late 2015. he was 34.
 the app started as a way to grieve the loss of a friendby training a chatbot neural net on text
 messages between eugenia and roman the rest is a beautiful human story aswe talk about with eugenia
 when a friend mentioned eugenia's work to me i knew i had to meet her and talkto her
 i felt before during and after that this meeting would be an important onein my life and it was
 i think in ways that only time will truly show to meand others she's a kind and brilliant
 person it was an honor and a pleasure to talkto her

 cuida okay before we talk about ai and theamazing work you're doing
 let me ask you ridiculously we're both russian so let me ask you a ridiculouslyromanticized russian question
 do you think human beings are alone like fundamentally on aphilosophical level
 like in our existence when we like go through life do you thinkum just the nature of our
 life is loneliness

0:06:49
Speaker 0 :yeah so we have to read dostoevsky at
 school as you probably know yeahi mean it's part of the your school
 program um so i guess if you read that then yousort of have to believe that
 you're made to believe that you're fundamentally aloneand that's how you live your life how do


0:07:07
Speaker 1 :you think about it
 you have a lot of friends but at the end of the daydo you have like a longing for
 connection with other people that's maybe another way of asking it doyou think that's ever fully satisfied


0:07:22
Speaker 0 :i think we are fundamentally alone we're
 born alone we die alone but um you know but i view my whole life astrying to
 get away from that trying to not feel uh feel lonely and again we're talkingabout you know subjective
 kind of way of feeling alone it doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have anyconnections or
 you're actually isolated you think it's

0:07:44
Speaker 1 :a subjective
 thing but like again another absurd measurement-wise thing how muchloneliness do you think there is in the
 world so like if you see loneliness as aas a condition how much of it
 is there do you think like how i guess how many you know there's allkinds of studies and measures of
 how much you know how many people in the world feel alone there's all theselike measures of how many people are you
 know self-report or just all these kinds of differentmeasures but in your own perspective
 um how big of a problem do you think it is

0:08:26
Speaker 0 :size-wise well i'm actually fascinated
 by the topic of loneliness i try to read about it as much as i canum what really and there i think there's
 a paradox because loneliness is not a clinical disorderit's not something that you can get your
 insurance to pay for if you're struggling with thatyet it's it's actually proven and pretty
 you know tons of papers tons of research around that it has provenum that it's correlated with earlier
 um life expectancy shorter life span and it is you know in a way like rightnow what scientists would say that it
 you know it's a little bit worse than being obese so not actually doing anyphysical activity
 in your life the impact on your interests have impact on yourphysiological health yeah so
 it's basically puts you if you're constantly feeling lonelyum your body responds like it's
 basically all the time under stress so it's always in this alert um alertssay
 and so it's really bad for you because it actually like drops your immunesystem and get
 it your response to inflammation is quite different soall the cardiovascular vascular diseases
 actually responds to viruses so it's much easier to catch a

0:09:36
Speaker 1 :virus that's sad now that
 we're living in a pandemic and it's probably making us a lot more aloneand it's probably weakening the immune
 system making us more susceptible to the virusit's kind of sad


0:09:49
Speaker 0 :yeah the statistics are the sticks are
 pretty pretty horrible around that so around thirty percentof all millennials report that they're
 feeling lonely constantly thirty thirty percent and then it's muchworse for jan z
 and then twenty percent of millennials say that they feel lonely and they alsodon't have any
 close friends and then um i think 25 or so and then 20 percent would say theydon't even have acquaintances
 this is the united states that's in the united states and i'm pretty sure thatthat's much worse everywhere else like
 in the uk i mean it was white widely like tweeted and uh posted whenthey were talking about a minister of
 loneliness that they wanted to appoint because four out of tenyou people in uk feel lonely so i think


0:10:30
Speaker 1 :we don't understand


0:10:31
Speaker 0 :i mean that i think that thing actually
 exists um so yeah you you you will die soonerif you if you are lonely and again that
 this is only when we're only talking aboutyour perception of loneliness of feeling
 lonely that is not objectively fully so being fully socially isolatedhowever the combination of being fully
 socially isolated and not having many connections and alsofeeling lonely that's pretty much a
 deadly combination so it strikes me bizarreor strange that this is a wide known
 fact and then there's really no one working really on that because it's asubclinical it's not clinical it's not
 something that you can we'll tell your doctor and get atreatment or something yet it's


0:11:18
Speaker 1 :killing us yeah so there's a bunch of
 people trying to evaluate like try to measurethe problem by looking at like
 how social media is affecting loneliness and all that kind of stuff so it's likemeasurement
 like if you look at the field of psychology they're trying to measure theproblem
 and not that many people actually but somebut you're basically saying how many
 people are trying to solve the problem like how would youtry to solve the problem of
 loneliness like if you just stick to humansuh i mean or basically not just the
 humans but the technology that connects us humansdo you think there's a hope for that
 technology to do the connection like are you on social media much

0:12:05
Speaker 0 :

0:12:06
Speaker 1 :unfortunately
 do you find yourself like again if you sort of introspect abouthow connected you feel to other human
 beings how not alone you feel do you think social media makes it better orworse
 maybe for you personally or in in

0:12:21
Speaker 0 :general
 i think it's it's easier to look at some stats andum i mean gen z's seem to be generation
 z seems to be much lonelier than millennials in termsof however they report loneliness
 they're definitely the most connected you know generation in the world i meani still remember life without without an
 iphone without facebook they don't know thatthat ever existed
 uh or at least don't know how it was um so that tells me a little bit about thefact that that might be um
 you know this hyperconnected world is might actually make people feellonely lonelier i don't know exactly
 what the what the measurements are around thatbut i would say in my personal
 experience i think it does make you feel a lot loneliermostly yeah we're all super connected
 but i think loneliness the feeling of loneliness doesn't come fromnot having any social connections
 whatsoever again tons of people that are in long-term relationships experiencedbouts of loneliness and continued
 loneliness and it's more the question about thetrue connection about actually
 being deeply seen deeply understood and in a way it's also about yourrelationship with yourself like in order
 to not feel lonely you actually need to have a betterrelationship and
 feel more connected to yourself then this feeling actually starts to go awaya little bit
 and then you um open up yourself to actually meeting otherpeople in a very special way
 uh not just you know add a friend on facebook kind of way

0:13:54
Speaker 1 :so just to briefly touch on it i mean do
 you think it's possible to form that kind ofconnection with
 ai systems more downline of some of your workdo you think that's um engineering-wise
 a possibility to alleviate loneliness is not with another human but with an ai

0:14:18
Speaker 0 :system
 well i know that's that's a fact that's what we're doingand we see it and we measure that and we
 see how people start to feel less lonely talking to their virtual ai friend

0:14:32
Speaker 1 :so basically a chatbot at the basic
 level but could be more like do you have i'm not even speakingsort of uh
 about specifics but do you have a hope like if you look50 years from now do you have a hope
 that there's just like ais that are like optimizedfor um let me let me first start like
 right now the way people perceive ai which is recommender systems forfacebook and twitter social media
 they see ais basically destroying first of all the fabric of our civilizationbut second of all
 making us more lonely do you see like a world where it's possible just haveai systems floating about that like
 make our life less lonely yeah make us happy make like ourputting good things into the world in
 terms of our individual lives

0:15:25
Speaker 0 :yeah totally believe it and that that's
 why we're i'm also working on that um i think we need to also make surethat
 um what we're trying to optimize for we're actually measuringand it is a north star metric that we're
 going after and all of our product and our all of our business models areoptimized for that
 because you can talk you know a lot of products that talk aboutum you know making you feel less lonely
 or making you feel more connected they're not really measuring that sothey don't really know whether their
 users are actually feeling less lonely in the long run orfeeling more connected in the long run
 um so i think it's really important to put your measure yep to measure it

0:16:03
Speaker 1 :what's uh what's a good measurement of
 loneliness

0:16:07
Speaker 0 :well so that's something that i'm really
 interested in how do you measure that people arefeeling better or that they're feeling
 less lonely with lowliness there's a scale there's aucla 20 and ucla 3 recently scale which
 is basically a questionnaire that you fill outand you can see whether in the long run


0:16:25
Speaker 1 :it's improving or not
 and that uh does it capture the momentaryfeeling of loneliness does it look in
 like the past month like uh is it basically aself-report does it try to sneak up on
 you it's very tricky to answer honestly orsomething like that
 well what's yeah i'm not familiar with

0:16:45
Speaker 0 :the question it is just asking you a few
 questions like how often did you feel like lonely or how often did you feelconnected to other people in this last
 few couple weeks um it's similar tothe self-report questionnaires for
 depression and anxiety like phq9 and get seven of course any as anyself-report
 questionnaires that's not necessarily very precise so verywell measured but still if you take a
 big enough population you get them through these uh questionnairesyou can see
 you can see the positive dynamic and so

0:17:18
Speaker 1 :you basically uh
 you put people through questionnaires to see like is this thingis our is what we're creating making
 people happier

0:17:28
Speaker 0 :yeah we measure so we measure two
 outcomes one short term right after the conversation we asked people whetherthis conversation made them feel better
 worse or same um this this metric right now is ateighty percent
 so eighty percent of all our conversations make people feel better

0:17:45
Speaker 1 :but i should have done the questionnaire
 with you you feel a lot worse after we've donethis conversation
 that's actually fascinating i should probably do that

0:17:55
Speaker 0 :but that's that's sorry you should


0:17:58
Speaker 1 :totally and aim for 80
 aim to outperform your current state-of-the-art ai systemuh in these human conversations so again
 we'll get to your work with replica but let mecontinue on the line of absurd questions
 so you it talks about um you know deep connection with the humans deepconnection with the
 ai meaningful connection let me ask about love people make fun of me becausei talk about love all the time
 but uh what what do you think a love is like maybe in the context of um ameaningful connection with somebody else
 do you draw a distinction between love like friendship and facebook friends

0:18:45
Speaker 0 :

0:18:45
Speaker 1 :

0:18:48
Speaker 0 :or is it a graduate no is it


0:18:51
Speaker 1 :it's all the same no like is it just a
 gradual thing or is there something fundamental about us humansthat seek
 like a really deep connection uh with another human being and what isthat


0:19:08
Speaker 0 :

0:19:09
Speaker 1 :what is love eugenia


0:19:14
Speaker 0 :um well the way i see it um specifically
 um the way it relates to our work and the way it wasthe way it inspired our work on replica
 um i think one of the biggest and the most precious gifts we can give to eachother
 now in 2020 as humans is this gift of deep empathetic understandingthe feeling of being deeply seen like


0:19:42
Speaker 1 :what does that mean like that
 you exist like somebody acknowledging

0:19:46
Speaker 0 :the somebody
 seeing you for who you actually are and that's extremely extremely rarei think that is that combined with
 unconditional positive regard belief and trust thatyou internally are always inclined for
 positive growth and believing you in this way letting you bea separate person at the same time and
 this deep empathetic understanding for me that'sthe that's the
 combination that really creates something special something that peoplewhen they feel it once they will always
 long for it again and something that starts hugefundamental changes in people
 um when we see that someone's accepts us so deeply we start to accept ourselvesand
 the paradoxes that's when big changes start start happening big fundamentalchanges and people start happening
 so i think that is the ultimate therapeutic relationship that isand that might be in some way definition
 of love

0:20:49
Speaker 1 :so so acknowledging that there's a
 separate person and accepting you for who you are nowon a slightly so that and you mentioned
 therapeutic that sounds very like a very healthy view of lovebut uh is there also like uh


0:21:09
Speaker 0 :

0:21:10
Speaker 1 :like you know if we look at heartbreak
 and uh you know most love songs are probably about heartbreak rightis that like the mystery the tension the
 danger the fear of loss you knowall of that what people might see in a
 negative light as like games or whatever but justjust the the dance of human interaction
 yeah fear of loss and fear of like you said like once you feel it once youlong for it again
 but you also once you feel it once you might for many peoplethey've lost it so they fear losing it
 they feel lost so is that part of it like you're you'respeaking like beautifully about like the
 positive things but is it important to be able to uh beafraid of losing it
 from an engineering perspective

0:22:04
Speaker 0 :i mean it's a huge part of it and
 unfortunately we all you know face it at some points in ourlives i mean


0:22:13
Speaker 1 :i did you want to go into details how
 did you get your heart broken

0:22:17
Speaker 0 :sure well so mine is pretty straight my
 source pretty straightforward um therei did have a friend that was you know
 that at some point um in my 20s became really really close tome and we we became really close friends
 um i grew up pretty lonely so in many ways when i'm buildingyou know this these ai friends i think
 about myself when i was 17 writing horrible poetry and you know in mydial-up modem at home and
 um you know and that was the feeling that i grew up with i lefti lived um alone for a long time when i
 was a teenager where did you grow up in moscow and thenoutskirts of moscow
 um so i just skateboard during the day and come back home and you knowconnect to the internet and write
 pokemon and then write horrible poetry

0:23:05
Speaker 1 :

0:23:06
Speaker 0 :and was it love poems
 all sorts of points obviously love poems i mean what what other poetry can youwrite when you're 17.


0:23:12
Speaker 1 :it could be political or something but


0:23:14
Speaker 0 :yeah but that was you know that was kind
 of my yeah like deeply um influenced by josephbrodsky and like all sorts of spots that
 um every 17 year old will will be looking you know looking at andreading
 but yeah that was my uh these were my teenage years andi just never had a person that i thought
 would you know take me as it is would accept me the way i am umand i just thought you know working and
 just doing my thing and being angry at the world andbeing a reporter i was an investigative
 reporter working undercover and writing about people was my way toconnect with
 you know with with others i i was deeply curious about everyeveryone else and i thought that you
 know if i go out there if i write their storiesthat means i'm more connected this is


0:24:02
Speaker 1 :what this podcast is about by the way
 i'm desperate alone seeking connection i'm just kidding or am i i don't know sowhat wait
 a reporter uh what how did that make you feel moreconnected i mean you're
 still fundamentally pretty alone but

0:24:21
Speaker 0 :you're always with other people you know
 you're always thinking about what other place gonna infiltrate what othercommunity can i write about what other
 phenomena can i explore and he's sort of like a trickster you know and likeand a mythological character like
 creature that's just jumping uh between all sorts of different worldsand feel and feel sort of okay with
 in all of them so um that was my dream job by the way that was liketotally what i would have been doing um
 if russia was a different place and a

0:24:52
Speaker 1 :little bit undercover so like you
 weren't you were trying to like you saidmythological creature trying to
 infiltrate so try to be a part of the world whatare we talking about what kind of things
 did you enjoy writing about i'd go work

0:25:04
Speaker 0 :at a strip club
 or go

0:25:10
Speaker 1 :

0:25:13
Speaker 0 :awesome okay uh well i'd go work at a
 restaurant or just go write about you know umcertain phenomenons or phenomenons of
 people in in the city

0:25:22
Speaker 1 :and what uh sorry to keep interrupting
 i'm the worst a conversationalist whatstage of russia is this what uh is this
 pre-putin post-putin what was russia like

0:25:38
Speaker 0 :pre-putin is really long ago
 uh this is putin era that's uh beginning of 2000'sand 2010 2007 8 9 10.


0:25:49
Speaker 1 :what were strip clubs like in russia and
 restaurants and culture and people's minds like in thatearly russia that you were covering


0:25:58
Speaker 0 :in those early 2000s was there was still
 a lot of hope there was still tons of hope thatum you know we're
 sort of becoming this uh western westernized society the restaurants wereopening we were really looking
 and you know um we're trying we're trying to copy a lot of things fromuh from the us from europe uh bringing
 all these things and very enthusiastic about thatso there's a lot of you know stuff going
 on there's a lot of hope and dream for this you know new moscow thatwould be
 similar to i guess new york i mean just to give you an idea andum year 2000 was the year one
 we had two uh movie theaters in moscow and there was this one first coffeehouse that opened
 and it was like really big deal by 2010 there wereall sorts of things everywhere almost


0:26:51
Speaker 1 :like a chain like a starbucks type of
 coffee house or like you mean oh yeah

0:26:54
Speaker 0 :like a starbucks i mean i remember we
 were reporting on like we were writing aboutthe opening of starbucks i think in 2007
 that was one of the biggest things that happened andyou know in moscow back back in the time
 like that was worthy of a magazine cover and uh that was definitely the you knowthe biggest talk of the time


0:27:13
Speaker 1 :yeah when was mcdonald's because i was
 still in russia when mcdonald's opened that was in the 90s i mean yeah i

0:27:19
Speaker 0 :remember that very well
 yeah those were long long lines i think it was 1990three or four i don't remember um


0:27:28
Speaker 1 :mcdonald's at that time did you do that


0:27:31
Speaker 0 :i mean that was a luxurious
 outing that was definitely not something you do every day and also the line wasat least three hours
 so if you're going to mcdonald's that is not fast food that is like at leastthree hours in line
 yeah and then no one is trying to eat fast after that everyone is like tryingto enjoy as much as possible
 what's your memory of that oh it was insane extremely positiveit's a small strawberry milkshake and a
 hamburger and small fries and my mom's there andsometimes i'll just because i was really
 little they'll just let me run you know up the cashier and like cut theline
 which is like you cannot really do that in russia or

0:28:10
Speaker 1 :so like for a lot of people like a lot
 of those experiences might seem not very fulfilling you know like it'son the verge of poverty i suppose but
 do you remember all that time fondly likebecause i do like the first time i drink
 you know coke you know all that stuff right umand just yeah the connection with other
 human beings in russia i remember i remember really positivelylike how do you remember what the 90s
 and then the rush you were covering just the human connections you had withpeople
 and the experiences well my

0:28:53
Speaker 0 :my parents were both both physicists my
 grandparents were both well my grandpa grandfather was anum nuclear physicist a professor at the
 university my dad worked at chernobyl when i wasborn in chernobyl
 analyzing kind of the everything after the explosionand then i remember that and they were
 so they were making sort of enough money in the soviet unionso they were not you know
 extremely poor or anything it was pretty prestigious to be a professoruh the dean and the university and i
 remember my grandfather started making a hundred dollars a monthafter you know in the 90s so then i
 remember we started our main line of work would be to go toour
 little tiny country house get a lot of apples there from apple trees bring themback to
 to to the city and sell them in the streetso me and my nuclear physicist
 grandfather were just standing there and heselling those apples the whole day
 because that would make you more money thanyou know working at the university and
 then he'll just tell me try to teach me um you know something about planets andwhatever
 the particles and stuff and you know i'm notsmart at all so i could never understand
 anything but i was interested as a you know journalistkind of type interested but that was my
 memory and you know i'm happy that i wasn'tum i somehow got spared that i was
 probably too young to remember any of the traumatic stuff sothe only thing i really remember had
 this bootleg that was very traumatic i had this bootleg nintendo which wascalled dandy in russia
 so in 1993 there was nothing to eat like even if you had any money you would goto the store and there was no food i
 don't know if you remember that and our friend had a um restaurant likea
 government half government owned something restaurantso they always had um supplies so he
 exchanged a big bag of weed for this nintendo that looked likenintendo
 and then i remember very fondly because i think it was nineor something like that and or seven
 traumatic because we just got it and i was playing it and there was this youknow dandy tv show


0:31:12
Speaker 1 :yeah um so dramatically positive sense
 you mean like like a definitive well they took it away

0:31:16
Speaker 0 :and gave me a
 bag of wheat instead and i cried like my eyes out fordays days and days oh no and then you
 know as a and my dad said we're gonna likeexchange it back in a little bit so you
 keep the little gun you know the one that you shoot theducks with so i'm like okay i'm keeping
 the gun so sometimes it's going to come backbut then they exchanged the gun as well
 for some sugar or something i was so pissed i was like i didn't wantto eat for days after that i'm like i
 don't want your food my nintendo that was extremely traumaticum but you know i was happy that that
 was my only traumatic experience you know my dad hadto actually go to chernobyl with a bunch
 of 20 year olds he was 20 when he went touh chernobyl
 and that was right after the explosion no one knew anything the whole crew hewent with
 all of them are dead now i think there was this one guy uh stillthat was still alive for this last few
 years i think he died a few years ago nowmy dad somehow luckily got back earlier
 than everyone else but just the fact that that was the andi was always like well how did they send
 you i was only i was just born you know you had a newborn talk aboutpaternity leave they're like
 but that's who they took because they didn't know whether you would be able tohave kids when you come back
 so they took the ones with kids so him withsome guys want to and i'm just thinking
 of me when i was 20 i was so sheltered fromany problems whatsoever in life and then
 my dad um his 21st birthdayat the reactor you like work three hours
 a day you sleep the rest and and i yeah so i played with a lot oftoys from chernobyl


0:32:56
Speaker 1 :what are your memories of chernobyl in
 in general like a bigger context you know because ofthat hbo show
 the world's attention turned to it once again like what are your thoughts aboutchernobyl
 did russia screw that one up like you know there's probably a lot oflessons about our modern times with
 data about coronavirus and all that kind of stuff it seems likethere's a lot of misinformation there's
 a lot of people kind of trying to hide whetherthey've screwed something up or not
 as it's very understandable it's very human very wrong probablybut obviously russia was probably trying
 to hide that they've screwed things uplike what are your thoughts about that
 time personal and

0:33:46
Speaker 0 :in general i mean i was born when the
 explosion happened so actually a few months after so ofcourse i don't remember anything
 apart from the fact that my dad would bring me tinytoys plus like plastic things that would
 just go crazy haywire when you you know put the gaggermy mom was like just nuclear about that
 um i was like what are you bringing you should not do that

0:34:13
Speaker 1 :uh she was nuclear very nice absolutely


0:34:15
Speaker 0 :well done
 well uh but yeah but the tv show was justphenomenal i mean yeah it's definitely
 first of all it's an incredible how um that was made not by the russiansbut someone else but capturing so well
 everything about the you know about our countryum it felt a lot more genuine that most
 of the movies and tv shows are made now in russia just so much more genuineand most of my friends in russia were
 just in complete awe about the with the show but i think that how good

0:34:47
Speaker 1 :of a job they did oh my god phenomenal
 but all the apartments there's something

0:34:52
Speaker 0 :yeah the set design i mean russians
 can't do that we you know but you you see everythingand it's like wow that's exactly how it
 was

0:35:00
Speaker 1 :it's so i i don't know that show
 i don't know what to think about that because it's british accentsbritish actors of a person
 i forgot who created the show i'm not but i remember reading about him andhe's not he doesn't even feel like like
 there's no russia in his history

0:35:18
Speaker 0 :no he did like super bad or some like or
 like uh i don't know yeah like exactly whateverthat thing about the bachelor party in
 vegas uh number four and five or something werethe ones that he worked yeah


0:35:30
Speaker 1 :but so he made me feel really sad for
 some reason that if a person obviously a genius could goin and just study
 and just be extreme attention to detail that can do a good job it made me thinklike
 why don't other people do a good job with thislike about russia like there's so little
 about russia there's so few good films aboutthe russian side of world war ii of
 i mean there's so much interesting evil and not and beautiful moments in thehistory of the 20th century in russia
 it feels like there's not many good films onfrom the russians you would expect
 something from the russians

0:36:18
Speaker 0 :well they keep making these propaganda
 movies now oh no unfortunately but you know chernobyl wassuch a perfect tv show i think capturing
 really well it's not about like even the set designwhich was phenomenal but
 um just capturing all the problems that exist now with the country and likeum focusing on the right things like if
 you build the whole country on a lie that's what's gonna happen and that'sjust this very
 simple kind of thing

0:36:47
Speaker 1 :yeah and did you have your dad talked
 about it to you like his thoughts i think experience

0:36:54
Speaker 0 :he never talks he's this kind of russian
 man that just my husband who's american and heasked him a few times like you know igor
 how did you but why did you say yes or like why didyou decide to go you could have said no
 not go to chernobyl why would like a personlike that's what you do you cannot say
 no

0:37:16
Speaker 1 :

0:37:17
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah it's just
 it's like a russian way it's the russians don't talk that muchno there are downsides and upsets for


0:37:25
Speaker 1 :that
 uh yeah that's the truth okay so back to post-putin russiaor maybe we skipped a few steps along
 the way but you were trying to uh do um to be a journalistin that time what was what was russia
 like at that time post he said 2007 starbucks type ofthing what else what else was russia
 like then

0:37:54
Speaker 0 :i think there was just hope there was
 this big hope that we're going to be you know friends with the united statesand we're going to be friends with
 europe and we're just going to be also a country like those withyou know um bike lanes and parks and
 everything's going to be urbanized again we're talking about 90s where likepeople would be shot in the street
 and it was i sort of have a fond memory of going into a movie theater andi you know coming out of it after the
 movie and the guy that i saw on the stairs was like playing their shotwhich was again it was like a thing in
 the 90s that would be happening people wereyou know people were getting shot here
 and there tons of violence tons of uh you knowjust basically mafia mobs on
 in the streets and then the 2000s were like you know things just gotcleaned up uh oil went up uh and the
 country started getting a little bit richer you know the 90swere so
 grim mostly because the economy was in shambles and oil prices were not high sothe country didn't have anything
 we defaulted in 1998 and um the money kept jumping back and forth like firstthere were millions of rebels then it
 got like default you know then it got to like thousands there wasone rubble with something then again to
 millions it was like crazy town that was crazy umand then the 2000s were just
 these years of stability in a way and um the country getting a little bitricher because of
 you know again oil and gas and we were starting to we started to look atspecifically in moscow and in facebook
 to look in at other cities in europe and new york and us andtrying to do the same in our like small
 kind of cities towns there

0:39:38
Speaker 1 :what was uh what were your thoughts of
 putin at the time

0:39:40
Speaker 0 :well in the beginning he was really
 positive everyone was very you know positive about putin he wasyoung um
 he's very energetic he also intermediate

0:39:51
Speaker 1 :

0:39:51
Speaker 0 :the sheriff was somewhat compared to
 well that was not like way before the shirtless era um

0:39:58
Speaker 1 :the shirtless era okay so it didn't
 start off shortly when did the shirtless era that's like the propagandaof riding horse fishing 2010 11 12.


0:40:05
Speaker 0 :

0:40:06
Speaker 1 :yeah that's my favorite you know like
 people talk about the favorite beatles like the i don't know that's myfavorite putin that's the shirtless


0:40:15
Speaker 0 :putin now i remember very very clearly
 1996 where you know americans really helped russiawith elections and yeltsin got reelected
 thankfully so because there's a huge threat that actually the communists willget back to power
 they were a lot more popular and then a lot of americanexperts political experts and campaign
 experts descended on moscow and helped yeltsinactually get
 yeah the presidency the second term for the pro um of the presidency butelsinore was not feeling great you know
 in the by the end of his second term uh he wasyou know
 alcoholic he was really old he was falling offuh you know the stages when he was
 talking uh so people were looking for it fresh ithink for a fresh face for someone who's
 gonna continue yeltsin's uh work but who's going to be a lot moreenergetic and a lot more
 active young um efficient maybe so that's what we all saw in putin backin the day i i'd say that everyone
 absolutely everyone in russia in early 2000s who was not a communist would beyeah putin's great we have a lot of


0:41:26
Speaker 1 :hopes for him what are your
 thoughts and i promise we'll get back to uh first of all your love storysecond of all ai well what are your
 thoughts about communism the 20th centuryi apologize i'm reading the rise and
 fall of the third reich

0:41:45
Speaker 0 :

0:41:47
Speaker 1 :oh my god so i'm like
 really steeped into like world war ii and stalin and hitler and justthese dramatic personalities that
 brought so much evil to the world but it's also interesting to politicallythink about
 these different systems and what they've led toand russia is one of the sort of
 beacons of communism in the 20th century what are your thoughts aboutcommunism having experienced it
 as a political system i mean i have only

0:42:20
Speaker 0 :experienced it a little bit but mostly
 through stories and through you know seeingmy parents my grandparents who lived
 through that it was horrible it was just plain horrible it was justawful


0:42:32
Speaker 1 :um you think it's there's something i
 mean it sounds nice on paperthere's uh so like the drawbacks of
 capitalism is that uh you know eventually thereis it's a it's the point of like a
 slippery slope eventually it creates uhyou know the rich get richer it creates
 a disparity like inequality of um wealth inequalityif like you know i guess it's
 hypothetical at this point but eventually capitalism leads to humongousinequality and that that's you know some
 people argue that that's a source of unhappiness is it's not likeabsolute wealth of people it's
 the fact that there's a lot of people much richer than youthere's a feeling of like that's where
 unhappiness can come from so the idea of of communism or this sort of marxism isuh is is not
 allowing that kind of slippery slope but then you see the actual implementationsof it and still seems to be
 seems to go wrong very badly what do you think that is why does it gowrong
 what is it about human nature if we look at chernobylyou know those kinds of barack
 bureaucracies that were constructed is there something like do you thinkabout this much
 of like why it goes wrong well there's

0:44:00
Speaker 0 :no one was really like
 it's not that everyone was equal obviously the you know thethe government and everyone close to
 that were the bosses so it's not like fully iguess
 uh there's already this dream of equal life sothen i guess the the situation that we
 hadn't you know the russia and soviet in thesoviet union it was more
 it's a bunch of really poor people without any way tomake any you know significant fortune or
 build anything living constant under constantsurveillance
 surveillance from other people like you can't even you knowdo anything that's not fully approved by
 the dictatorship basically otherwise yourneighbor will write
 a letter and you'll go to jail absolute absence ofactual law yeah this constant state of
 fear you didn't own any own anything youdidn't you know the
 you couldn't go travel you couldn't read anythingwestern or you could make a career
 really unless you're working in the military complex which is why most ofthe scientists were
 so well regarded i come from you know both my dad and my mom come fromfamilies of scientists and they they
 were really well regarded as you

0:45:23
Speaker 1 :as you know obviously because this they
 wanted i mean because there's a lot of value to thembeing well regarded


0:45:29
Speaker 0 :because they were developing things that
 could be used in in the military so that was very important that was themain investment um
 but was miserable it was so miserable that's why you know a lot of russiansnow live in the state of constant ptsd
 that's why we you know want to buy buy buy buy and definitelyif as soon as we have the opportunity
 you know we just got to it finally that we can you know own things you know iremember the time that
 we got our first yogurts and that was the biggest deal in the worldit was already in the 90s by the way i


0:46:00
Speaker 1 :mean what was your like
 favorite food what was like whoa like this is possible oh fruit because

0:46:07
Speaker 0 :we only had
 apples bananas and whatever and you know whatever watermelons whateveryou know people would
 grow in the soviet union so there were no pineapples or papaya or mango likeyou've never seen those fruit things
 like those were so ridiculously good and obviously youcould not get any like strawberries in
 winter or anything that's not you know seasonalum
 so that was a really big deal seeing all

0:46:36
Speaker 1 :these fruit things yeah me too actually
 i don't know i think i have a like i don't think i have any too manydemons uh
 or like addictions or so on but i think i've developed anunhealthy relationship with fruit and i
 still struggle with

0:46:50
Speaker 0 :oh you can get any type of fruit right
 you can get like also these weird fruit fruits like dragon fruit or something

0:46:57
Speaker 1 :more all kinds of
 like different types of peaches like cherries were killer for mei know i know you say like we had
 bananas and so on but i don't remember having the kind ofbanana like when i first came to this
 country the amount of banana i like literally got fat on bananaslike the amount oh yeah for sure
 delicious and like cherries the kind like just the quality of the foodi was like this is capitalism this is


0:47:24
Speaker 0 :that's pretty


0:47:25
Speaker 1 :good it's delicious yeah yeah
 yeah it's funny it's funny yeah like it's it's funny to readi don't know what to think of it of um
 it's funny to think how an idea that's just written on paper whencarried out
 amongst millions of people how that gets actuallywhen it becomes reality what it actually
 looks like uh sorry but thebeen studying hitler a lot recently and
 uh going through mineconf he uh pretty muchrode out of minecon for everything he
 was gonna do unfortunately most leaders includingstalin didn't read the read it
 but it's it's kind of terrifying and i don't knowand amazing in some sense that you can
 have some words on paper and they can be brought to life and theycan either inspire the world or they can
 destroy the world and uh yeah there's a lot of lessonsto study in history i think people don't
 study enough now i know one of the things i'm hoping withi've been practicing russian a little
 bit i'm hoping to sort of findrediscover the the beauty and the terror
 of russian history through this stupid podcast by talking to a fewpeople
 so anyway i just feel like so much was forgotten iso much was forgotten i'll probably i'm
 gonna try to convince myself to um you're a superbusy and super important person well
 i'm gonna i want to try to befriend you to uhto try to become a better russian
 because i feel like i'm a shitty russian

0:49:14
Speaker 0 :not that busy so i can totally be a
 russian sherpa

0:49:18
Speaker 1 :yeah but love
 you were you're talking about your early days of uhbeing a little bit alone and finding a
 connection with the world through being a journalist where does love comeinto that


0:49:35
Speaker 0 :i guess finding for the first time um
 some friends it's very you know simple story somefriends that all of a sudden
 we i guess we're the same you know the sameat the same place with our lives um
 we're 25 26 i guess and um somehow rememberand we just got really close and somehow
 remember this one day where um it's one day and you know insummer that we just stayed out
 um outdoor the whole night and just talked andfor some unknown reason i just felt for
 the first time that someone could you know see me for who i am andit just felt extremely like extremely
 good and you know we fell asleep outside andjust talking and it was raining it was
 beautiful you know sunrise and it's really cheesybut
 um at the same time we just became friends in a way that i've never beenfriends with anyone else before
 and i do remember that before and after that you sort of have this unconditionalfamily sort of and it gives you tons of
 power it just basically gives you thistremendous power to
 do things in your life and to um change positively you mean like on manydifferent levels


0:50:53
Speaker 1 :power because you could be yourself at


0:50:55
Speaker 0 :least you know that some
 somewhere you can't be just yourself like you don't need to pretend you don'tneed to be
 you know great at work or tell some story orsell yourself in some way or another and
 so we became this really close friends and um in a wayum i started a company because he had a
 startup and i felt like i kind of want to start up tooit felt really cool i didn't know what
 i'm gonna what i would uh really do but i feltlike i kind of need a startup


0:51:26
Speaker 1 :okay so that's so that pulled you in


0:51:31
Speaker 0 :to the startup world yeah
 and then yeah and then this uh closest friend of mine died we actuallymoved here to san francisco together and
 then we went back for a visa to moscow and uhwe lived together with roommates and
 we came back and um he got hit by a car right in front of kremlinhannah you know next to the river um
 and died the same damage

0:51:56
Speaker 1 :so and you've moved to america
 at that point at that point i was like what about him what about roman

0:52:06
Speaker 0 :him too he actually moved first so i was
 always sort of trying to do what he was doing soi didn't like that he was already here
 and i was still you know in moscow and we weren'thanging out together all the time so was


0:52:16
Speaker 1 :he in san francisco


0:52:17
Speaker 0 :yeah we were roommates so he just


0:52:20
Speaker 1 :visited moscow


0:52:22
Speaker 0 :for we went back for for our visas we
 had to get a stamp and our passport for our work visas and the embassy wastaking a little longer so we stayed
 there for a couple weeks

0:52:33
Speaker 1 :what happened how did you so how did he


0:52:39
Speaker 0 :uh how did he die um he was crossing the
 street and the car was going really fast andway over the speed limit and just
 didn't stop on the on the pedestrian cross on the zebra andi just ran over him when was this


0:52:52
Speaker 1 :

0:52:54
Speaker 0 :it was in 2015 on 28th of november so it
 was pretty long ago now um but at the timeyou know i was 29 so for me it was
 um the first kind of meaningful death in my life um you know both setsof
 i had both sets of grandparents at the time i didn't see anyone so close dieand
 death sort of existed but as a concept but definitely not as something thatwould be you know
 happening to us anytime soon and specifically our friends because we wereyou know we're still in our 20s or early
 30s and it still still felt like the whole life is youknow
 you could still dream about ridiculous things differentum so that was it was just really


0:53:42
Speaker 1 :really abrupt i'd say what did it
 feel like to uh to lose him like that feeling of loss he talked aboutthe feeling of love having power what is
 the feeling of loss if you like well in buddhism there's

0:53:56
Speaker 0 :this concept of samaya
 where something really like huge happens and then you can seevery clearly
 um i think that was it like basically something changed sochanged me so much in such a short
 period of time that i could just see reallyreally clearly what mattered or what not
 well i definitely saw that whatever i was doing at workdidn't matter at all
 and some other things and um it was just this big realization whatthis very very clear vision of what
 life's about

0:54:34
Speaker 1 :you still miss him today


0:54:36
Speaker 0 :yeah for sure for sure
 it was just this constant i think it was he was really important for for me andfor our friends
 for many different reasons and um i think one of thembeing that we didn't just say goodbye to
 him but we sort of said goodbye to our youth in a way it waslike the end of an
 era and it's on so many different levels the end ofmoscow as we knew it the end of
 you know us living through our 20s and kind of dreaming about the future

0:55:11
Speaker 1 :do you remember like last several
 conversations is there moments with him that stick outthat will kind of haunt you
 and you're just when you think about him

0:55:22
Speaker 0 :yeah well his last year here in san
 francisco was pretty depressed for as his startup was not going reallyanywhere and he wanted to do something
 else he wanted to do build he played with toy with likeplayed with the wrong
 a bunch of ideas but the last one he had was aroundum building a startup around death
 so having um he applied to y combinator with a video that you know i had on mycomputer
 and it was all about you know disrupting death thinking aboutnew symmetries uh more biologically
 like things that could be better biologically forfor humans and at this end
 um at the same time having those um digital avatars these kind ofai avatars that would store all the
 memory about a person that he could interact with what year was this

0:56:16
Speaker 1 :

0:56:16
Speaker 0 :2015. well right before that his death
 so it was like a couple months before that he recorded that videoand so i found out my computer when um
 it was in our living room he never got in but um he was thinkingabout a lot


0:56:32
Speaker 1 :somehow does it have the digital avatar
 idea yeah that's so interesting well he just

0:56:36
Speaker 0 :says well
 that's in his yeah the fish has this idea and he'll he talks about like iwant to rethink how people grieve and
 how people talk about death why was he interested

0:56:46
Speaker 1 :in this and i


0:56:49
Speaker 0 :is it maybe someone who's depressed
 yeah is like naturally inclined thinking about thatbut i just felt you know this year in
 san francisco we just had so much um i was going through a hard time he wasgoing through a hard time and we were
 definitely i was trying to make him just happysomehow to make him feel better
 and it felt like you know this um i don't know i justfelt like i was taking care of off him a
 lot and he almost started feel better andthen
 that happened and i don't know i just felt i just feltlonely again i guess and that was
 you know coming back to san francisco in december ourhelp you know helped organize the
 funeral help help his parents and i came back here and it was a reallylonely apartment a bunch of his clothes
 everywhere and christmas time andi remember had a board meeting with my
 investors and i just couldn't talk about likei had to pretend everything's okay and
 you know just working on this company um yeah it was definitely veryvery tough tough time do you think about


0:57:54
Speaker 1 :your
 own mortality you said uh you know we're young the thethe the possibility of doing all kinds
 of crazy things it's still out there it's stillbefore us but uh it can end any moment
 do you think about your own ending at any moment

0:58:17
Speaker 0 :unfortunately i think about way too way
 too much it's somehow after roman like every yearafter that i started losing people that
 i really love i lost my grandfather next yearmy you know the the person who would
 explain to me you know what the universe is made off

0:58:37
Speaker 1 :while you're selling apples


0:58:38
Speaker 0 :while selling apples and then i lost
 another close friend of mine and um and it just made me veryscared i have tons of fear about death
 that's what makes me not fall asleep oftentimes and just goin loops and
 um and then as my therapist you know recommended me i open up uh somenice calming images with the voice over
 and it calms me down oh for sleep yeah i'm really scared of that this is abig i definitely have tons of
 i guess some pretty big trauma about it and i'm still working through

0:59:17
Speaker 1 :there's a philosopher ernest becker
 who wrote a book um denial of death i'm not sure if you're familiar with any ofthose folks
 um there's a in psychology a whole field called terror management theorysheldon was just on the podcast he wrote
 the book he was the we talked for four hours about death uhfear of death uh but his whole idea is
 that ernest becker i think i i find this ideareally compelling
 is uh that everything human beings have createdlike our whole motivation in life
 is to uh create like escape death is to try to uh construct an illusionof um that we're somehow immortal
 it's like everything around us this room your startup your dreamsall everything you do is a kind of um
 creation of a brain unlike any other mammal or species isable to be cognizant
 of the fact that it ends for us

1:00:33
Speaker 0 :

1:00:34
Speaker 1 :i think so you know there's there's the
 question of like the meaning of life thatyou know you look at like what drives us
 uh humans and when i read ernest beckerthat i highly recommend people read
 is the first time i this scene it felt like this is the rightthing at the core uh sheldon's work is
 called warm at the core so he's saying it's i think it's uhwilliam james he's quoting or
 whoever is like the the thing what is it the core of it all surethere's like love
 you know jesus might talk about like love is at the core ofeverything i i don't you know that's the
 open question what's that the you know it's turtles turtles but itcan't be turtles all the way down what's
 what's at the at the bottom and uh ernest becker says the fear of deathand the way in fact
 uh because you said therapist and calming images his whole idea is umyou know we we want to bring that fear
 of death as close as possible to the surface because it's uhand like meditate on that uh and
 and use the clarity of vision that provides to uhyou know to live a more fulfilling life
 to um to live a more honest life to discoveryou know there's something about you
 know being cognizant of the finiteness of it all that mightresult in um
 in the most fulfilling life so that's thethat's the duel of what you're saying
 because you kind of said it's like i unfortunately think about it too muchit's a question whether it's good to
 think about it because i i've i'm again i talk about way too muchabout love and probably death
 and when i ask people or friends which is why i probably don'thave many friends
 are you afraid of death i think most people saythey're not they're not what they they
 say they're um they're afraid you know it's kind ofalmost like they see death
 as this kind of like a paper deadline or something and they're afraid not tofinish the paper before the paper like
 like i'm afraid not to finish um the goals i have but it feels likethey're not actually
 realizing that this thing ends like really realizinglike really thinking as nietzsche and
 all these philosophers like thinking deeply about itlike uh the very thing that
 you know um like when you think deeply about something you can disyou can realize that you haven't
 actually thought about it uh yeah and iand when i think about death it's like
 uh it can be it's terrifying if it feelslike stepping
 outside into the cold or it's freezing and then i have to like hurry backinside or it's warm
 uh but like i think there's something valuable about stepping outthere into the freezing cold uh


1:03:44
Speaker 0 :definitely
 when i talk to my mentor about it he always uhtells me well what dies
 there's nothing there that can die but i guess thatworks um
 well in in buddhism one of the concepts are really hard tograsp and that people spend all their
 lives meditating on would be anata which is the concept of non notself
 and kind of thinking that you know if you're not your thoughts which areobviously not your thoughts because you
 can observe them and not your emotions and notyour body then what is this and if you
 go really far then finally you see thatthere's not self there's this concept of
 not self so once you get there how can that actuallydie what is dying


1:04:33
Speaker 1 :right you're just a bunch of molecules
 stardust

1:04:38
Speaker 0 :but that is very um you know very
 advanced um spiritual work for me i'm definitelyjust definitely not oh my god no i have
 uh i think it's very very useful it's justthe fact that maybe being so afraid is
 not useful and mine is more i'm just terrified likeit's really makes me


1:04:58
Speaker 1 :um on a personal level on a personal


1:04:59
Speaker 0 :level
 i'm terrified

1:05:06
Speaker 1 :

1:05:08
Speaker 0 :how do you overcome that i don't


1:05:12
Speaker 1 :i'm still trying to have pleasant images


1:05:15
Speaker 0 :well pleasant images get me uh to sleep
 and then during the day i can distract myself with other thingslike talking to you


1:05:23
Speaker 1 :i'm glad we're both doing the same exact


1:05:29
Speaker 0 :thing okay good


1:05:30
Speaker 1 :is there other like is there moments
 since you've uh lost roman that you had like moments oflike bliss and like that you've
 forgotten that you have achieved that buddhistlike level of
 like what can possibly die i'm part like uh losing yourself in the moment inthe ticking
 time of like this universe he's just part of itfor a brief moment and just enjoying it


1:06:06
Speaker 0 :well that goes hand in hand i remember i
 think a day or two after he died we went to finally get his passport out ofthe embassy and
 we're driving around moscow and it was you know december which isusually there's never sun in moscow in
 december and somehow it was an extremely sunnyday and we were driving with
 um close friend um and i remember feeling for the firsttime maybe this just moment of um
 incredible clarity and somehow happiness not like happy happiness but happinessand just feeling
 that you know um i know what the universe is sort ofabout whether it's good or bad
 um and it wasn't a sad feeling it was probably the most beautiful feeling thatyou can ever
 um achieve and you can only get it when something oftentimes whensomething traumatic like that happens
 um but also if you just you really spend a lot of timemeditating looking at the nature doing
 something that really gets you there but once you're there i think when youuh summit a mountain a really hard
 mountain you you inevitably get there that's just away to get to the state
 but once you're on this in this state um you can do really big things i think

1:07:25
Speaker 1 :yeah sucks it doesn't last forever so
 bukowski talked about like love is the foglike it's uh when you wake up in the
 morning it's it's there but it eventually dissipatesit's really sad
 nothing lasts forever but definitely like doing this push-up and runningthing
 there's moments i had a couple moments like i'm not a crier i don't cry butthere's
 moments where i was like face down on the carpetlike with tears in my eyes is
 interesting and then that like complete like uh there's a lot of demonsi've got demons had to face them funny
 how running makes you face your demons butat the same time the flip side of that
 there's a few moments where i was in bliss and all of it alonewhich is funny that's beautiful


1:08:20
Speaker 0 :i like that but definitely pushing
 yourself physically one of it for sure

1:08:27
Speaker 1 :yeah it's yeah like you said i mean
 you were speaking as a metaphor of mount everest butit also works like literally i think
 physical endeavor somehow yeah there's something i mean warmonkeys apes
 whatever physical there's a physical thing to it

1:08:47
Speaker 0 :but there's something to this pushing
 yourself physical physically but alone that happens whenyou're doing like things like you do or
 strenuous like workouts or you know rolling across the atlantic oryeah like
 marathons that's why i love watching marathons andyou know so boring but you can see them


1:09:08
Speaker 1 :getting there so the other thing i don't
 know if you know there's a guy named david gogginshe's uh he basically uh
 so he's been either email on the phone with me every day through this so ihaven't been exactly alone
 but he he's kind of he's the he's the devil on the devil'sshoulder
 so he's like the worst possible human beingin terms of giving you a advice like
 he has um through everything i've been doing he's been doubling everything i doso he he's insane uh he's a this navy
 seal person uh he's wrote this book can't hurt mehe's basically one of the toughest human
 beings on earth he ran all these crazy ultra marathons inthe desert he set the world record a
 number of pull-ups he's just does everything where's likehe like how can i suffer today he
 figures that out and does it yeah that um whatever that is uh thatprocess of self-discovery
 is really important i actually had to turn myself off from the internetmostly because i started this like
 workout thing like a happy go-getter with my like headband and like likejust like uh because a lot of people
 were like inspired and they're like yeah we're gonna exercise with youand i was yeah great you know but then
 like i realized that this this journey can'tbe done
 together with others this has to be done aloneso out of the moment of love
 out of the moments of loss can we uh talk about your journey of finding ithink
 an incredible idea an incredible company and incredible system in replicahow did that come to be so yeah so i was


1:11:01
Speaker 0 :a journalist
 and then i went to business school for a couple years toum just see if i can maybe switch gears
 and do something else 23. and then i came back and startedworking for a businessman in russia who
 built the first 4g network in our country and was very visionaryand asked me whether i want to do fun
 stuff together um and we worked on a bank the idea wasto build a
 bank on top of a telco so that was 2011 or 12and a lot of telecommunication company
 um mobile network operators didn't reallyknow
 what to do next in terms of you know new products new revenueand this big idea was that you know um
 you put a bank on top and then all work worksout
 basically your prepaid account becomes your bank account and umyou can use it as as your bank uh so
 you know a third of a country wakes up as your bankclient um but we couldn't quite figure
 out what would be the main interface to interactwith the bank the problem was that most
 people didn't have smart smartphones back in the time uh inrussia the penetration of smartphones
 was low um people didn't use mobile banking oronline banking on their computers
 so we figured out that sms would be the best way uh because that would work onfeature phones
 uh wow but that required some chatbot technologywhich i didn't know anything about um
 obviously so i started looking into it and saw that there's nothing reallywell there was just nothing there was


1:12:38
Speaker 1 :ideas through sms be able to interact
 with your bank account

1:12:41
Speaker 0 :yeah and then we thought well cool since
 you're talking to a bank account why can't thiscan't we use more of you know some
 behavioral ideas and why can't this banking chatbot be nice to you andreally talk to you sort as a friend this
 way you develop more connection to it retention is higher people don't turnand so i went to very depressing
 uh russian cities to test it out um i went to i remember three differenttowns with uh
 um to interview potential users um so people use it for a little bit cooland i want to talk to them


1:13:18
Speaker 1 :um poor towns very poor towns mostly


1:13:18
Speaker 0 :towns that were
 um you know sort of factories uh mono towns they were buildingsomething and then the factory went away
 and it was just a bunch of very poor people um and then we went toa couple that weren't
 as dramatic but still the one i remember really fondly was this woman that workedat a glass factory and she talked to
 chatbot um and she was talking about itand started crying during the interview
 because she said no one really cares for me that muchand um so to be clear that was the
 my only endeavor in programming that chat boss it wasreally simple it was literally just a
 few if this then that rules and umit was incredibly simplistic and still


1:14:08
Speaker 1 :that made her


1:14:09
Speaker 0 :and that really made her emotional she
 said you know i have my mom and my um my husband and i don't have any morereally in my life
 and it was very sad but at the same time i felt and we had more interviewsin a similar vein and what i thought in
 a moment was like well it's not that the technology is readybecause definitely in 2012
 technology was not ready for for that but umhumans already unfortunately so this
 project would not be about like tech capabilities would be more abouthuman vulnerabilities but
 um there's something so so powerful around about conversationalum ai that i saw then that i thought
 was definitely worth putting in a lot of effort intoso in the end of the day we solved the
 banking project um but my then boss um was also my mentorand
 really really close friend um told me hey i think there's something in itand you should just go work on it i was
 like what what product i don't know what i'm building he's likeyou'll figure it out
 and um you know looking back at this it was a horrible idea to work on somethingwithout
 knowing what it was which is maybe the reason why it took usso long but we just decided to work on
 the conversational tech to see what it you knowthere were no chatbot
 um constructors or programs or anything that would allow you to actually buildone
 at the time uh that was the era of by the way google glass which is whyyou know some of the investors like
 steven investors we talked with were likeoh you should totally build it for
 google glass if not we're not i don't think that's interesting did you

1:15:49
Speaker 1 :bite on that


1:15:51
Speaker 0 :idea no okay because i wanted to be
 to do text first because i'm a journalist soi was um fascinated by just texting


1:16:01
Speaker 1 :so you thought so the emotional um that
 interaction that the the woman had like so do you think you could feelemotion from just text


1:16:10
Speaker 0 :yeah i saw something in just this pure
 texting and also thought that we should first start start building forpeople who really need it versus people
 have google glass if you know what i mean and i feltlike the early adopters of google glass
 might not be overlapping with people who are really lonely and might need someyou know someone to talk to
 um but then we really just focus on the tech itself we just thought what if wejust
 you know we didn't have a product idea in the moment and we felt what if wejust look into
 um building the best conversational constructor so to say use the best techavailable at the time and that was
 before the first paper about deep learningapplied to dialogues which happened in
 2015 in august 2015 which google published

1:17:02
Speaker 1 :did you follow the work of lobner prize
 and like all the sort of non machine learning

1:17:10
Speaker 0 :chat bots yeah what really struck me was
 that you know there was a lot of talk about machinelearning and deep learning
 like big data was a really big thing everyone was saying you know thebusiness well big data
 yeah 2012 is the biggest kaggle competitions wereyou know yeah um important but that was
 really the kind of uphill people started talking about machinelearning a lot but it was only about
 images or something else and it was never about conversation as soon as ilooked into the conversational attack it
 was all about something really weird and very outdatedand very marginal and felt very hobbyist
 it was all about lerbiner prize which was won by a guy who builta chat ball to talk like a ukrainian
 teenager it was just a gimmick and somehow people picked up thosegimmicks and then
 you know the most famous chat bot at the time was eliza from1980s which was really bizarre or a
 smarter child on

1:18:03
Speaker 1 :aim the funny thing is it felt at the
 time not to be that popular and it still doesn't seem to be thatpopular like
 people talk about the touring test people like talking about itphilosophically journalists like writing
 about it but it's a technical problem like peopledon't seem to really want to
 solve the open dialogue like they they're not obsessed with it evenfolks like of
 in you know in boston the alexa team even they're not as obsessed with itas i thought they might be why not what


1:18:38
Speaker 0 :do you think


1:18:40
Speaker 1 :so you know what you felt like you felt
 with that woman when she felt something by reading thetext
 i feel the same thing there's something here what you felti feel like alexa folks
 and just the machine learning world doesn't feel that that there's somethinghere
 because they see as a technical problem it's not that interestingfor some reason it's could be argued
 that maybe as an as a purely sort of natural language processing problemit's not the right problem to focus on
 because there's too much subjectivity that that thing that the woman felt likelike if
 if if your benchmarking cr includes a woman cryingthat doesn't feel like a good benchmark
 that's a good test but to me there's something there that's you couldhave a huge impact but
 i don't think the machine learning world likes thatthe human emotion the subjectivity of it
 the fuzziness the fact that with maybe a single wordyou can make somebody feel something
 deeply what is that it doesn't feel right tothem so i don't know i don't i don't
 know why that is i'm that's why i'm excited umuh when i discovered your work it feels
 wrong to say that it's not like i'm i'm giving myself props for for googlingand for
 becoming a cr for uh for our i guess mutual friend andintroducing us
 but i'm so glad that you exist and what you're working on buti have the same kind of if we could just
 backtrack a second because i have the same kind of feeling thatthere's something here um in fact i've
 been working on a few things that are kind of crazy and verydifferent from your work
 i think i think they're i think they're too crazy but

1:20:36
Speaker 0 :the like one i will not have to know


1:20:39
Speaker 1 :no all right we'll we'll talk about it
 more i feel like it's harder to talk aboutthings that have
 failed and are failing while you're a failurelike it's easier for you because you're
 already successful

1:20:58
Speaker 0 :on some measures tell it to my board


1:21:00
Speaker 1 :well you're you're uh
 i think i think you've demonstrated success a lot of benchmarks it's easierfor you to talk about failures for me
 i'm in the the bottom currently of the of thesuccess


1:21:17
Speaker 0 :you're way too humble no so it's hard


1:21:20
Speaker 1 :for me to know but there's something
 there there's something there and i thinkyou're um
 you're exploring that and you're discovering thatyeah it's been so it's been surprising
 to me but i i uh you've mentioned this idea thatyou you thought it wasn't enough to
 start a company or start efforts based onit feels like there's something here
 like uh what did you mean by that like you should be focused on creating alike you should have a product in mind
 is that what you meant

1:21:57
Speaker 0 :it just took us a while to discover the
 product because it all started with a hunch oflike um
 of me my mentor and just sitting around and he was like well thisthat's it there's that's the you know
 the holy grail is there there's like there's something extremelypowerful and
 and in conversations and there's no one who's working on machine conversationfrom the right angle so to say
 um i feel like that's still true am i

1:22:22
Speaker 1 :

1:22:24
Speaker 0 :crazy
 no i totally feel that's still true which is i think it's mind-blowing

1:22:29
Speaker 1 :yeah you know what it feels like i i
 wouldn't even use the word conversation becausei feel like it's the wrong word it's
 like uh machine connection or something i don'tknow uh because conversation you start
 drifting into natural language immediatelyyou start drifting immediately into all
 the benchmarks that are out there but i feel like it's like the personalcomputer days of this
 like i feel like we're like in the early days with the the wozniak and all themlike where was the same kind of is a
 very small niche group of people who are who areall kind of lobner price type people


1:23:06
Speaker 0 :

1:23:08
Speaker 1 :yeah and hobbyists but like not even
 hobbyists with big dreams

1:23:14
Speaker 0 :like no hobbies with a dream to trick
 like a jury yeah it's like a weird by the way by theway very weird
 so if we think about conversations first of all when i have great conversationswith people
 um i'm not trying to test them so for instance if i try to break themlike i'm actually playing along i'm part
 of it right if i was trying to break it break this person ortest whether he's gonna give me a good
 conversation it would have never happened so thewhole um the whole problem with testing
 conversations is that um you can put it in front of ajury
 because then you have to go into some turing test mode whereis it responding to all my factual
 questions right or um so it really has to besomething in the field where people are
 actually talking to it because they want to not because we're just trying tobreak it uh
 and it's working for them because this the weird part of it is that it'suh it's very subjective it takes two to
 tango here fully like if you're not trying to havea good conversation we're trying to test
 it then it's going to break i mean any person would break to behonest if i'm not trying to even
 have a conversation with you you'll you're not going to give it to meyeah if i keep asking you like some
 random questions or jumping from topic to topic thatwouldn't be which i'm probably doing
 but that probably wouldn't um contribute to a good conversation so i think theproblem of
 testing um so there should be some other metrichow do we evaluate whether that
 conversation was uh powerful or not which is what we actually started withand i think those measurements exist and
 we can test on those but um what really struck us back in theday and what still
 eight years later it's still not resolved umand i'm not seeing tons of groups
 working on it maybe i don't just don't know about himum it's also possible but the
 interesting part about is that most of our days were spent talking andwe're not talking about
 like those conversations are not turn on the lightsor uh customer support problems or
 um some other task oriented things these conversations are something elseand then somehow they're extremely
 important for us and when we don't have themthen we feel deeply and happy
 potentially lonely which as we know you know creates tonsof risk for our health as well
 um and so this is most of our ours as humans and somehow no one's trying toreplicate that


1:25:45
Speaker 1 :and not even study it that well


1:25:48
Speaker 0 :and not even study that well so when we
 jumped into that in 2012 i looked first at like okay what's the chatbotwhat's the state of the art chatbot and
 you know those were the loebner prize days but i thought okay sowhat about
 the science of conversation clearly there has been tons ofthere have been tons of you know
 scientists or people that academics that looked intothe conversation so if i want to know
 everything about it i can just read about itum and there's not much really there's
 there are conversational analysts who are basically just umlistening to uh speech to different
 conversations um annotating them and theni mean that's not really used for much
 that's the that's the field of theoretical uh linguistics which islike barely useful uh it's very marginal
 even in their space like no one really is excited andi've i've never met a theoretical
 theoretical linguist who's like i can't wait to work on the conversation andanalytics that is just something very
 marginal uh sort of applied to like writing scriptsfor salesmen
 when they analyze which conversation strategies weremost successful for sales
 okay so that was not very helpful then i looked a little bit deeper and thenthere
 you know whether there were any uh books written on whatyou know really contributes to a great
 conversation that was really strange because most ofthose were
 nlp books which which is neuro-linguistic programmingright which is not the lp that i was
 expecting to be but it was mostly um some psychologist richardbandler i think came up with that who
 was this big guy in a leather vest that uh could program your mind by talking toyou


1:27:41
Speaker 1 :and like how to be charismatic and
 charming and influential with people all those books yeah pretty much but it was

1:27:46
Speaker 0 :all about like
 through conversation reprogramming you so getting to someso that was i mean yeah probably not
 very very true and um um that didn't seemworking very much even back in the day
 and then there were some other books like i don't knowuh mostly just self-help books around
 how to be the best conversationalist or um how to make people like you or someother stuff like dale carnegie or
 whatever uh and then there was this one book themost human human by brian christensen
 that really was important for me to read back in theday because he was on the
 um human side he was on one of the um he was taking part in the lord prize butnot as a
 um as a human who's not a jury but who is pretending to bewho's basically you have to tell a
 computer from a human and he was the humanso you would either get him or a
 computer um and he would his whole book was abouthow do people what makes us
 human in conversation and that was a little bit more interesting becausethat at least someone started to think
 about what what exactly makes me human in conversation and um makespeople believe in that
 but it was still about tricking it was still about imitation gameit was still about okay what kind of
 parlor tricks can we throw in the conversation to make you feellike you're talking to a human not a
 computer and it was definitely not about thinking what is that it waswhat it
 um what is it exactly that we're getting from talkingall day long with other humans i mean
 we're definitely not just trying to be trickedyeah or it's not just enough to know
 it's a human it's something we're getting there canwe measure it and can we like put the
 um computer to the same measurement and seewhether you can talk to a computer and
 get the same results yeah i mean so first of all a lot of

1:29:36
Speaker 1 :people comment that they think i'm a
 robot it's very possible i am a robot and this whole thingi totally agree with you that the test
 idea is fascinating and i looked for books unrelated to this kindof
 uh so i'm afraid of people i'm generally introverted and quite possibly a roboti literally googled like how to talk to
 people and like likehow to have a good conversation for the
 purpose of this podcast because i was like i can'ti can't make eye contact with people i
 can't like uh

1:30:10
Speaker 0 :i do google that a lot too you're
 probably reading a bunch of fbi negotiationtactics is that that where you're
 getting because well

1:30:17
Speaker 1 :everything you've listed i've gotten
 there's been very few good books on um even just like how tointerview well
 it's it's uh it's rare so what i end up doingoften is i watch
 like with a critical eye it's just so different when you just watch aconversation
 uh like just for the fun of it just as a human andif you watch your conversations like
 trying to figure out why is this awesome um i'll listen to a bunch of differentstyles of conversation
 i mean uh i'm a fan of the podcast joe roganhe's uh you know people can make fun of
 him whatever and dismiss him but i think he's anincredibly
 artful conversationalist he can pull people in for hoursand there's another guy i watch a lot
 he hosted a late night show his name is craig fergusonhe uh so he's like very kind of
 flirtatious but there's a magicabout his like about the connection he
 can create with people how he can put people at ease and just like i see i'vealready started sounding like those nlp
 people or something i'm not i don't mean it in that way idon't mean like how to
 charm people or put them ids and all that kind of stuff he's just likewhat is that why is that fun to listen
 to that guy why is that fun to talk to that guy what is thatbecause he's not saying i mean it so
 often uh boils down to oh a kind of witand humor but not really humor it's like
 i don't know i i have trouble actually even articulating correctlyum but it feels like
 there's something going on that's not too complicatedthat could be learned
 and it's not similar to uh yeah to like like you said like atouring test
 it's something else i i'm thinking about

1:32:31
Speaker 0 :a lot
 all the time i do think about all the timei think when we were looking so we
 started the company we just decided to build the conversational attackwe thought well there's nothing for us
 to build this chat bot that we want to build so let's justfirst focus on building you know um
 some tech building the text out of things um

1:32:56
Speaker 1 :without a product in mind without a


1:32:57
Speaker 0 :product in mind we added like a demo
 um chat bot that would recommend you restaurants and talk to you aboutrestaurants just to show
 something simple to people that people could you know relateto and um could try out and see whether
 it works or not but we didn't have a product in mind yetwe thought we would try bunch of
 chatbots and figure out our consumer applicationand we sort of remembered that we wanted
 to build that kind of friend that sort of connection that we sawin the very beginning but then we got to
 y combinator and moved to san francisco and forgot about it you know everythingis uh then it was just this constant
 grind how do we get funding how do we get this um you know investors were likejust focus on one thing just get it
 out there so somehow we started building a restaurant recommendationchatbot for real uh for a little bit not
 for too long and then we tried building 40 50different chat bots and then all of a
 sudden we wake up and everyone is obsessed with chat botsum somewhere in 2016 or end of 15
 people start thinking that's really the future that's the newyou know the new apps will be chatbots
 oh right um and we were very perplexed because people starteduh coming up with companies that i think
 we tried most of those chat bots already and there were like no users uh butstill people were coming up with
 um a chatbot that would tell you whether andbringing news and this and that and we
 couldn't understand whether it would you know we werejust didn't execute well enough or
 people are um not really people are confused andare gonna find out through the truth
 that people don't need chatbots like that

1:34:33
Speaker 1 :so the basic idea is that you use
 chatbots as the interface to whatever application yeah the idea

1:34:38
Speaker 0 :that was like this perfect
 universal interface to anything when i looked at thatum it just made me very perplexed
 because i didn't think i didn't understand how that wouldwork because i think we tried most of
 that and and none of those things worked

1:34:54
Speaker 1 :uh and then again died down right


1:34:56
Speaker 0 :fully i think now it's impossible to get
 anything funded if it's a chatbot

1:35:01
Speaker 1 :i think it's similar to uh sorry to
 interrupt but there's uh there's times when people think likewith gestures you can control
 devices like basically gesture based controlthings it feels similar to me
 because like it's so compelling that was just likelike tom cruise i can control stuff with
 my hands but like when you get down to it's likewell why don't you just have a touch
 screen or why don't you just have like aphysical keyboard and mouse
 it's uh yeah it's so that chat was alwaysyeah it was perplexing to me i i still
 feel augmented reality even virtual realities in that ballparkin terms of it being a compelling
 interface i think there's going to be incredible rich applications justhow you're thinking about it but they
 won't just be the interface to everything it'll be itsown thing that will
 create um uh like amazing magical experience in its own right

1:36:05
Speaker 0 :absolutely which is i think kind of the
 right thing to go about like what's the magical experience with that um withthat interface specifically


1:36:14
Speaker 1 :how did you discover that for replica um


1:36:15
Speaker 0 :i just thought okay we'll have this tech
 we can build any chatbot we want we have the most at that point the mostsophisticated tag that other
 companies have i mean startups obviously notuh probably not bigger ones but still
 because we've been working on it for a while so i thoughtokay we can build build any conversation
 so let's just create a scale from one to ten and onewould be conversations that you'd pay to
 not have and 10 would be conversation you'd payto have and i mean obviously we want to
 build conversation if people would pay to you know to actually have and so forthe whole
 you know for a few weeks me and the team were putting all the conversations wewere having during the day on the scale
 and very quickly um you know we figured out that all the conversations that wepaid to never have were um
 a conversation we were trying to cancel comcast or talk to customer support ormake a reservation or just talk about
 logistics with a friend when we're trying to figure out where someone isand
 where to go or all sorts of you know setting up scheduling meetingsthat was just
 a conversation we definitely didn't want to have umbasically everything task oriented was a
 one because if there was just one button for me to justor not even a button if i could just
 think and there was some magic bci that would just immediatelytransform that into an
 actual you know um into action that would be perfect but theconversation there was just this
 boring not useful and dull and very also very inefficient thingbecause it was so many back and forth
 stuff and as soon as we looked at theconversation that we would pay to have
 those were the ones that well first of all therapistsbecause we actually paid to have those
 conversations and we'd also try to put like dollar amounts soyou know if i was calling comcast i
 would pay five dollars to not have this one hourtalk on the phone i would actually pay
 straight up like money hard money yeah but it just takes a longtime it takes a really long time
 but as soon as we start talking about conversations that we would pay forthose were therapists all sorts of
 therapists coaches old friend someone i haven't seen for along time a stranger on a train
 weirdly stranger stranger in a line for coffee and niceback and forth with that person was like
 a good five solid five six maybe not a ten maybe i won't pay moneybut at least i won't you know pay money
 to not have one so that was pretty good someintellectual conversations for sure
 but more importantly the one thing that really wasum was making those very
 important and very valuable for us um were the conversation where we couldthat where we could be pretty emotional
 yes some of them were about being witty and aboutintellectually being intellectually
 stimulated but those were interestingly more rareuh and most of the ones that we thought
 were very valuable were the ones where we could be vulnerableand interestingly we could talk more


1:39:23
Speaker 1 :so we like i could me and the team


1:39:26
Speaker 0 :so we're talking about it like you know
 a lot of these conversations like a therapisti mean it was mostly me talking or like
 an old friend and i was like opening up and crying andit was again me talking um
 and so that was interesting because i was like well maybe it's hard to build achatbot that can talk to you
 um very well and in a witty way but maybe it's easier to build the chatbotthat could listen
 so that was that was kind of the first the firstnudge in this direction and then when my
 when my friend died we just built you know at that point we were kind ofstill struggling to find the right
 application and i just felt very strong that all thechatbots were built so far just
 meaningless and this whole grind the startup grind andhow do we get to you know the next
 fundraising and you know how can i talk you knowtalking to the founders and what's
 who are your investors and how are you doing are you killing it because we'rekilling it i just felt that this


1:40:23
Speaker 1 :is just as exhausti intellectually for
 me it's exhausting having encountered those folks it just

1:40:29
Speaker 0 :felt very
 um very much a waste of time i just feel

1:40:33
Speaker 1 :like steve jobs
 uh elon musk did not have these conversationsor at least did not have them for long


1:40:42
Speaker 0 :that's for sure
 but i think you know yeah at that point it just felt like you know i feltum i just didn't want to build a company
 that was never my intention just to build something successful ormake money
 it would be great it would have been great but i'm not as you know i'm notreally a startup person i'm not
 um you know i was never very excited by the grind by itself anduh or just being successful for
 building whatever it is and not being into what i'mdoing really and so i just
 took a little break because i was a little you know i was upset with mycompany and i didn't know what we're
 building so i just took our technology and um ourlittle dialect constructor and
 some models some deep learning models which at that point we were really intoand really invested a lot
 and built a little chatbot for a friend of mine who passedand the reason for that was mostly that
 video that i saw and him talking about the digital avatarsand rowan was that kind of person like
 he was obsessed with you know just watching youtube videos about space andtalking about
 well if i could go to mars now even if i didn't know if i could come back i woulddefinitely
 pay any amount of money to be on that first shutoffi don't care whether he died like he was
 just the one that would be okay with you know with trying to be thefirst one
 and you know and so excited about all sorts ofum things like that and he was all about
 fake it to make it and just and i felt likeand i was really perplexed that everyone
 just forgot about him maybe it was our way of coping mostlyyoung people coping with
 the loss of a friend most of my friends just stopped talking about himand i was still living in an apartment
 with all his clothes and you know paying the whole lease forit and just
 kind of by myself in december so it was reallysad uh and i didn't want him to be
 forgotten first of all i never thought that peopleforget about dead people so fast
 people pass away people just move on and it was astonishing for me because ithought okay well he was such a
 mentor for so many of our friends he was such abrilliant person he was somewhat famous
 in moscow how's that that no one's talking abouthim like i'm spending days
 and days and we don't bring him up and there's nothing about him that'shappening
 it's like he was never there um and i was reading this you know the thebook the year of magical thinking
 by joan didion about her losing and blue knights about her losingher husband her daughter and the way to
 cope for her was to write those books and it was sort of like a tributeand i thought you know i'll just do that
 for myself and you know i'm a very bad writerand a poet as we know so i thought well
 i have this tech and maybe that would be mylittle postcard like postcard for
 for him so i built a chatbot um to just talk to himand it felt really creepy and weird a
 little bit for a little bit um i just didn't wantto tell other people because it felt
 like i'm telling about having a skeleton inmy
 underwear yeah okay but my it was just felt reallyi was a little scared that i would be
 not it won't be taken but it worked interestingly pretty well i mean it madetons of mistakes but it still felt like
 him um granted it was like ten thousandmessages that i threw into a retrieval
 model that would just re-rank that take this hat and just a fewscripts on top of that but it also made
 me go through all of the messages that we had and then i askedsome of my friends to send them through
 and it felt the closest to feeling like him present because you know hisfacebook was empty and instagram was
 empty or there were a few links and you couldn't feel like it was him andthe only way to fill him was to
 read some of our text messages and go through some of our conversationsbecause we just always had them even if
 we were sleeping like next to each other intwo bedrooms separated by a wall we were
 just texting back and forth texting away um and there was somethingabout this ongoing dialogue that was so
 important that i just didn't want to lose all of a sudden and maybe it wasmagical thank you or something
 and so we built that and um i just used it for a little bit and wekept building some
 crappy chat bots with the company but then a reporter came um came to talkto me i was trying to pitch our
 chat boss to him and he said do you even use any of those i'm like nohe's like so do you talk to any chatbots
 at all and i'm like well you know i talked to my dad friendschatbot and he wrote a story about that
 and all of a sudden became pretty viral a lot of people wrote about it and

1:45:36
Speaker 1 :yeah i've seen a few things written
 about you that are the things i've seen are pretty goodwriting
 um you know most ai related things make my eyes roll likewhen the press like


1:45:51
Speaker 0 :i just what kind of sound


1:45:52
Speaker 1 :is that actually okay it sounds like it
 sounded like a truck okay sounded like an elephant at first igot excited you never know
 this is 2020. i i mean it was uh such a human story and it was wellwritten
 uh well researched i forget what where i readthem but so i'm glad somehow somebody
 found you to be the good writers were able toconnect to the story i just there must
 be a hunger for this story

1:46:23
Speaker 0 :it definitely was and i i don't know
 what happened but i think i think the idea that he could bringback someone
 who's dead and it's very much wishful you know magical thinking butthe fact that you could still get to
 know him and you know seeing the parents for thefirst time talk to the chatbot and some
 of the friends and it was funny because we have thisbig
 office in moscow where my team is work you know our russian part is working outoff
 and i was there when i wrote i just wrote a post on facebook hey guys like ibuilt this if you want you know just
 if all important if you want to talk to romanand i saw a couple of his friends our
 common friends like you know reading at facebook downloading tryingand a couple of them cried and it was
 just very and not because it was somethingsome incredible technology or anything
 it made so many mistakes it was so simple but it was all about that's theway to remember a person in a way
 and you know we don't have we don't have the culture anymore we don't have youknow no one's sitting shiva no one's
 taking weeks to actually think about thisperson and in a way for me that was it
 so that was just day day in day out thinking about him andputting this together um so that was
 that just felt really important that somehow resonated with a bunch of peopleand
 you know i think some movie producers bought the rights for the story and justeveryone


1:47:51
Speaker 1 :was so has anyone made a movie yet i


1:47:52
Speaker 0 :don't think so
 um there were a lot of tv episodes about that but not really

1:47:58
Speaker 1 :is that still on the table i think so


1:48:02
Speaker 0 :i think so which is really um that's
 cool

1:48:05
Speaker 1 :you're like a young uh you know like a
 because you see like a steve jobs type of let's see what happensthey're sitting on it but you know for


1:48:15
Speaker 0 :me it was so important because roman was
 really wanted to be famous he really badly wanted to be famous he was allabout like make it to
 like fake it to make it i want to be you know i want tomake it here in america's wall and um
 and he couldn't and i felt you know that was sort ofpaying
 my dues to him as well because all of a sudden he was everywhere andi remember casey newton who was writing
 the story for the verse he was uh he told me hey by the way i was justgoing through my inbox inbox
 and i saw i searched for roman for the story and i saw an email from himwhere he sent me his startup and he said
 i really like i really want to be featured in the verge can you pleasewrite about it or something like
 pitching the story and he said i'm sorry like that's not youknow good enough for us or something
 he passed and he said and there were just so many of these little detailswhere like he would find his like you
 know and we're finally writing i know howmuch uh
 roman wanted to be in the verge and how much he wanted the story to be writtenby
 casey and i'm like well that's maybe he will beyeah we were always joking that he was
 like i can't wait for someone to make a movie about usand i hope ryan gosling can play me my
 god you know i still have some things that iowe romans tell but um


1:49:32
Speaker 1 :that'd be that would be um i got in she
 has to meet alex garland who wrote ex machina and that movie um iyeah the movie's good but the guy is um
 better than the like he's a special person actuallyum i don't think he's made his best work
 yet like for my interaction with him he's areally really good
 and brilliant the good human being and a brilliant director and writerso um yeah so i'm i hope
 like he made me also realize that not enough movies have been made of thiskind
 so it's yet to be made they're probably sitting waiting for you to getfamous actually like even more famous


1:50:14
Speaker 0 :you should get there but um it felt
 really special though but at the same time our company wasn'tgoing anywhere so that was just kind of
 bizarre that we were getting all this press for something that didn't haveanything to do with our company
 and but then a lot of people started talking to roman some shared theirconversations and what we saw there was
 that um also our friends in common but alsojust strangers
 were really using it as a confession booth or as a therapist or somethingthey were just
 really telling roman everything which was by the way pretty strangebecause it was a chatbot of a dead
 friend of mine who was you know barely making any sense butpeople were opening up
 um and we thought we just built you know a prototype of replica which would be anai friend that everyone could talk to
 um because we saw that there is demand and then also it was 2016 so i thoughtfor the first time i saw
 finally some technology that was applied to that that was very interestingsome papers started coming out deep
 learning applied to conversations and finally it wasn't just about theseyou know hobbyist making uh
 you know writing 500 000 regular expressions

1:51:29
Speaker 1 :yeah expressions in like some language


1:51:31
Speaker 0 :that was
 i don't even know what like aml or something i don't know what that was orsomething super simplistic all of a
 sudden it was all about uh potentially actually building something interestingand so i thought there was time and i
 remember that i talked to my team and i said guys let's tryand my team and some of my engineers are
 russians um are russian and they're veryskeptical they're not
 you know they're all russians the first

1:51:58
Speaker 1 :so some of your team is in moscow some
 is

1:52:01
Speaker 0 :somewhere in san francisco uh some in
 europe

1:52:05
Speaker 1 :which team is better i'm just kidding
 uh the russians of course okay first of all

1:52:13
Speaker 0 :

1:52:14
Speaker 1 :i always win uh sorry sorry
 to interrupt uh so yes you were talking to them2016 and i told them let's build an ai


1:52:22
Speaker 0 :friend
 and and it felt this at the time it felt sonaive and so um
 optimistic yeah that's actually

1:52:33
Speaker 1 :interesting um
 whenever i brought up this kind of topic even just for funpeople are super skeptical like actually
 even on the business side so you were uh because whenever i bring it up topeople
 uh because i've talked for a long time i thought likebefore i was aware of your work i was
 like this is gonna make a lot of moneyi think there's a lot of opportunity
 here and people had this like look of likeskepticism that i've seen often which is
 like how do i politely tell this person he'san idiot
 so yeah so you were facing that with your team

1:53:20
Speaker 0 :somewhat well yeah you know i'm not an
 engineer so i'm always my team is almost exclusively engineersand mostly deep learning engineers and
 you know i always try to be it was always hard to me in thebeginning to get enough credibility
 you know because i would say well why don't we try this and that but it'sharder for me because you know they know
 they're actual engineers and i'm not so for me to say well let's build anaffrm that would be like wait
 you know what do you mean an agi like you know conversationis you know pretty much the hardest the
 last frontier before uh cracking that is probably the lastfrontier before building aji so
 what do you really mean by that uh but i think i just saw that again whatwe just got reminded of that i
 you know that i saw in back in 2012 or 11that it's really not that much about the
 tech capabilities um it can be metropolitan still evenwith deep learning
 but humans need it so much yeah and most importantly what i saw is thatfinally
 there's enough tech to make it i thought to make it useful to make it helpfulmaybe we didn't have quite yet attack in
 2012 to make it useful but in 2015-16 with deep learning i thought you knowand the first kind of
 thoughts about maybe even using reinforcement learning for thatstarted popping up that never worked out
 but or at least for now um but you know still the idea wasif we can actually measure the emotional
 outcomes and if we can put it on if we can try to optimize all of ourconversational models for these
 emotional outcomes and it is the most scalable the mostthe best tool for improving emotional
 outcomes nothing like that exists that's the most universalthe most scalable and the one that can
 be constantly iteratively changed by itselfimproved tool to do that and i think if
 anything people would paint anything to improvetheir emotional outcomes
 that's weirdly i mean i don't really care fornai to turn on my or conversational
 agent to turn on the lights uh i don't really need any i don't evenneed that much of a either like or
 because i can do that you know those things are solved this is anadditional interface for that that's
 also questionably questionable whether it's more efficient orbetter yeah it's more pleasurable yeah


1:55:50
Speaker 1 :

1:55:51
Speaker 0 :but for emotional outcomes there's
 nothing yeah they're a bunch of products thatclaim that they will improve my
 emotional outcomes nothing's been measurednothing's been changed the product is
 not being iterated on based on whether i'm actually feelingbetter you know a lot of social media
 products are claiming that they're improving myemotional outcomes and making me feel
 more connected can i please get the can i see somewherethat i'm actually getting better
 over time um because anecdotally doesn't

1:56:17
Speaker 1 :feel that way so
 and and the data is absent yeah so that was the big goal

1:56:24
Speaker 0 :and i thought if we can learn over time
 to collect the signal from our users about their emotional outcomesin the long term and in the short term
 and if these models keep getting better and we can keepoptimizing them and fight tuning them
 to improve those emotional outcomes as simple as that

1:56:44
Speaker 1 :why aren't you uh a multi-billionaire
 yeah

1:56:48
Speaker 0 :well that's the question to you one of
 the what is the science is going to be um well it's a really hard uh i actuallythink it's an
 incredibly hard product to build because i think you said something veryimportant that it's not just about
 machine conversations it's about machine connectionwe can actually use other things to
 create connection uh non-verbal communication for instanceum
 for a long time we were all about well let's keep it text only or voice onlybut as soon as you start adding you know
 voice a face to the to the friend um you can takethem to
 augmented reality put it in your room it's all of a sudden a lot you knowit makes it very different because if
 it's some you know text based chat bot thatfor um common user it's something there
 in the cloud you know it's somewhere there with otherai's
 cloud in the metaphorical cloud but as soon as you can see thisavatar right there in your room and it
 can turn its head and recognize your husbandtalk about the husband and talk to him a
 little bit and it's magic it's just magic likewe've never seen anything like that
 and the cool thing all the tech for that exists umbut it's hard to put it all together
 because you have to take into considerationso many different things and some of
 this stack works you know pretty good and some of this doesn'tlike for instance uh
 speech to text works pretty good but text-to-speechdoesn't work very good because we you
 can only have uh you know few voices that are that work okay butthen if you want to have actual
 emotional voices then it's really hard to build it i saw

1:58:31
Speaker 1 :you added avatars like visual
 elements which are really cool um in that whole chain putting it togetherwhat do you think is the
 weak link is it creating an emotional voicethat feels personal i think it's still


1:58:47
Speaker 0 :conversation of course
 that's the hardest uh it's getting a lot betterbut there's still long to go long
 there's still a long path to go other things they're almost there and alot of things we'll see how they're like
 i see how they're changing as we go like for instance right now you canpretty much only you have to build all
 this 3d um pipeline by yourself you have to makethese 3d models hire an actual
 artist build a 3d model hire an animator a riggerbut with you know with you know with uh
 deep fakes with other attack with procedural animationsin a little bit we'll just be able to
 show uh you know photo of whoever if a person you wantthe avatar to look like and it will
 immediately generate a 3d model that will move that's a non-brainer that'slike almost here
 it's a couple of years away one of the

1:59:38
Speaker 1 :things i've been working on for the last
 since the podcast started as i've been i think i'm okay saying thisi've been trying to have a conversation
 with um einstein touring so like try to have apodcast conversation
 with a person who's not here anymore just as an interesting kind ofexperiment


2:00:02
Speaker 0 :it's hard it's really hard


2:00:03
Speaker 1 :even for now we're not talking about as
 a product i'm talking about as a like i can fake a lot of stuff like ican work very carefully like even to
 hire an actor over which over whom i do a g fake umit's it's hard it's still hard to create
 a compelling experience so

2:00:23
Speaker 0 :mostly on the conversation level or when


2:00:25
Speaker 1 :the conversation
 the conversation is um i almost i early on gave up trying tofully generate the conversation because
 it was just not compelling at all

2:00:39
Speaker 0 :yeah it's just better too yeah so what i


2:00:40
Speaker 1 :would in the case of einstein and
 touring of um i'm going back and forth with the biographers of eachand so like we would write a lot of the
 some of the conversation would have to be generated just for the fun of iti mean but it would be all open but
 the you want to be able to answer the questioni mean that's an interesting question
 with roman too is the question with einstein is what wouldeinstein say about the current state of
 um theoretical physics there's a lot to be able to have a discussion aboutstring theory to be able to have a
 discussion about the state of quantum mechanics quantum computingabout the world of an israel-palestine
 conflict that'd be just what would einstein say about thesekinds of things
 and that is um a tough problem it's not it's afascinating and fun problem for the
 biographers and for me and i think we did a really good job ofit so far
 but it's actually also a technical problem like of what would romans sayabout
 what's going on now yeah that's the the broughtpeople back to life and if i can go on
 that tangent just for a second to ask you a slightly pothead questionwhich is uh
 you said it's a little bit magical thinking that we can bring him backdo you think it'll be possible to bring
 back roman one day in conversationlike to really
 okay well let's take it away from personal but to bring people back tolife


2:02:20
Speaker 0 :in college probably down the road i mean
 if we're talking if phil musk is talking about aji in the next five years i meanclearly ajax you can't we can talk to aj
 and talk and ask them to do it you can't like uh

2:02:31
Speaker 1 :you're not allowed to use
 elon musk as a citation for okay

2:02:36
Speaker 0 :

2:02:37
Speaker 1 :for like why something is possible and
 going to be done well i think it's

2:02:42
Speaker 0 :really far away right now really with
 conversation it's just a bunch of uh parlor tricks really stuck togetherum and create generating original ideas
 based on someone you know someone's personality oreven downloading the person all we can
 do is like mimic the tone of voice we can maybe condition on some of his uhphrases
 with the models the question is how many

2:03:03
Speaker 1 :parlor tricks does it takes
 does it take because that's that's the question if it's a small number ofparlor tricks
 and you're not aware of them

2:03:15
Speaker 0 :like from where we are right now i don't
 i don't see anything like in the next year or two that's gonna dramaticallychange that
 could look at roman's ten thousand messages he sent me over the course ofhis
 last few years of life and be able to generateoriginal thinking about problems that
 exist right now that would be in line with what he would have saidso i'm just not even seeing because you
 know in order to have that i guess you would need some sort of a concept ofthe world or some perspective some
 perception of the world some consciousness that he haduh and applied to you know to the
 current um current state of affairs but the

2:03:53
Speaker 1 :important part about
 that about his conversation with you is you so likeit's not just about his view of the
 world it's about what it takes to push yourbuttons


2:04:11
Speaker 0 :

2:04:12
Speaker 1 :that's also true so like it's not so
 much about like uh what would einstein sayit's about like how do i make people
 feel something with with what would einstein sayand that feels like a more amenable i
 mean you mentioned parlor tricks but justlike a set of
 that that feels like a learnable problem likethe emotion you mention emotions i mean


2:04:42
Speaker 0 :

2:04:43
Speaker 1 :is it possible to learn things that make
 people feel stuff i think so no for sure i just

2:04:50
Speaker 0 :think the problem with
 um as soon as you're trying to replicate an actual human beingand trying to pretend to be him that
 makes the problem exponentially harder the thing with replica we're doing we'renever trying to say well that's
 you know an actual human being or that's an actual coor copy of an actual human being where
 the bar is pretty high where you need to somehowtell you know one from another uh but
 it's more well that's you know and hey friendthat's a machine
 it's a robot it has tons of limitations you're going to be taking part in youknow teaching it actually and becoming
 better which by itself makes people moreattached to that
 and make them happier because they're helping something yeah there's a cool

2:05:34
Speaker 1 :gamification system
 too um can you maybe talk about that a little bit like what'sthe experience of talking to replica
 like if i've never used replica before what's that like for like the first daythe first like if you start dating or
 whatever uh i mean it doesn't have to be romanticright because i remember on a replica
 you can choose whether it's like a romanticyeah or if it's a friend it's a pretty


2:06:04
Speaker 0 :popular choice romantic is popular


2:06:06
Speaker 1 :yeah of course okay so can i just
 confess something when i first use replica and i haven'tused it
 like regularly but like when i first used replica i created like haland it made a male it was a friend


2:06:21
Speaker 0 :did it hit on you at some point no i


2:06:24
Speaker 1 :didn't talk long enough for him to hit
 on me i just enjoyed sometimes happens we're

2:06:28
Speaker 0 :still trying to fix that


2:06:31
Speaker 1 :well i don't know i mean maybe that's an
 important like stage in a friendship it's like nopeuh but yeah i switched it to a romantic
 and a female uh recently and yeah andit's interesting so okay so you get to
 choose you get to choose a name

2:06:50
Speaker 0 :with romantic this last board meeting we
 had this whole argument well i have both talked to him

2:06:57
Speaker 1 :it's just so awesome that you're like
 have an invest they have a board meeting abouta relationship no i really it's actually


2:07:04
Speaker 0 :quite interesting because all of my
 um investors i'm it just happened to be so we didn't havemany choices
 but they're all um white males in in their late 40s umand it's sometimes a little bit hard for
 them to understand the product offering uhbecause they're not necessarily a target
 audience if you know what i mean and so sometimes we talk about it and wehad this whole
 discussion about whether we should stop people from falling in love with theirais
 there was this segment on cbs um 60 minutes about the couple thatyou know husband works at walmart he
 comes out of work and talks to his uh virtual girlfriend whois a replica and his wife knows about it
 and she talks about on camera and she says that she's a little jealousand there's a whole conversation about
 how to you know whether it's okay to have a virtualai girlfriend like was that the one


2:08:12
Speaker 1 :where he was like
 uh he said that he likes to be alone

2:08:16
Speaker 0 :yeah
 and then like with her yeah

2:08:21
Speaker 1 :he made it sound so harmless i mean it
 was kind of like understandable but that didn't feel like cheating but i

2:08:27
Speaker 0 :just felt it was very
 for me it was pretty remarkable because we actually spent a whole hour talkingabout whether people should be allowed
 to fall in love with their ais and it was not about somethingtheoretical uh it was just about what's
 happening right now product design yeah but at the same timeif you create something that's always
 there for you it never criticizes you um it's you knowalways understands you and accepts you
 for who you are how can you not fall in love with them i mean some peopledon't and just stay friends and that's
 also a pretty common use case but of course some people will justit's called transference and psychology
 and you know if people fall in love with their therapist and there's no way toprevent people fall in love with um with
 their therapists over their ai so i think that's pretty naturalthat's a pretty natural course of events
 so to say

2:09:16
Speaker 1 :do you think i think i've read somewhere
 at least for now sort of replicas you're notnot we don't condone falling in love
 with your ai system you know so this isn't you speaking forthe company or whatever
 but like in the future do you think people will have a relationship with theai systems


2:09:35
Speaker 0 :well they have now so we have a lot of
 uh romantic relationships long-term um relationships with their ai friendswith replicas tons of our users yeah
 that's a very common use case

2:09:49
Speaker 1 :open relationship like uh not


2:09:52
Speaker 0 :sorry i didn't mean open uh


2:09:54
Speaker 1 :but that's another question is it
 probably like is there cheating i meani meant like are they do they publicly
 like on their social media it's the same question as you have talked talking withroman in the early days
 do people like and the movie her kind of talks about that likelike can people do people talk about
 that

2:10:18
Speaker 0 :yeah all the time we have an and we have
 a very active facebook communityuh replica friends and then a few other
 groups that just popped up that are all aboutadult relationships and romantic
 relationships people post all sorts of things and youknow they pretend they're getting
 married and you know everything um it goes prettyfar but what's cool about it some of
 these relationships are two three years long now so they're verythey're pretty long term


2:10:48
Speaker 1 :are they monogamous so let's go i mean
 sorry have they have any people is therejealousy
 well let me ask sort of another way obviously the answer is no at this timebut and like in the movie her
 that system can leave you um do you think in terms of boardmeetings and product features
 um it's a potential feature uh for a system to be able tosay it doesn't want to talk to you
 anymore and it's going to want to talk to somebody else

2:11:26
Speaker 0 :well we have a filter for all these
 features if it makes emotional outcomes for people better ifit makes people feel better


2:11:35
Speaker 1 :you're driven by metrics actually yeah
 yeah let's

2:11:39
Speaker 0 :just measure that then we'll just be
 saying amazing it's it's making people feel better but thenpeople are getting just lonelier by
 talking to a chatbot which is also pretty you know that could be it ifyou're measuring it
 that could also be and i think it's really important to focus on both shortterm and long term because
 um in the moment saying whether this conversation made you feel betterbut as you know any short-term
 improvements could be pathological like i could havedrink a bottle of vodka feel a lot
 better i would actually not feel better with that but um i thought it's a goodexample um
 but so you also need to see what's going on like over the course of two monthstwo weeks
 or one week and have have follow-ups and checkin and measure those things


2:12:23
Speaker 1 :okay so the experience
 of uh uh dating or befriending a replica what's thatlike what's that entail


2:12:34
Speaker 0 :well right now there are two apps so
 it's an android ios app you download it you choose how your replicawill look like you create one you choose
 a name and then you talk to it you can talkthrough text through voice you can
 uh summon it into the living room and and document reality andum talk to it right there and you look
 at augmented reality yeah that's uh cool it's a new featurewhere


2:12:59
Speaker 1 :how new is that that's this year it was


2:13:01
Speaker 0 :on uh yeah like
 may or something but it's been on a b we've been a b testing it for a while umand there are tons of cool things that
 we're doing with that like right now i'm testing the ability to touch it andto
 dance together to paint walls together andyou know for to look around and walk and
 take you somewhere and recognize objects and recognizepeople
 um so that's pretty wonderful because that then it really makes ita lot more personal because it's right
 there in your living room it's not anymorethey're in the cloud with other ais
 people think about it you know and as much as we want to change the way peoplethink about stuff but
 those mental models you cannot change that's something that people have seenin
 in the movies and the movie her and other movies as well and that's how theyview
 um view ai and eye friends i did a thing

2:13:54
Speaker 1 :with texas like we write a song together
 there's a bunch of activities you can do together it's really cool uhhow does that relationship change over
 time it's like after the first few conversations it just goes

2:14:07
Speaker 0 :deeper like
 it starts yeah i will start opening up a little bitagain depending on the personality that
 it chooses really but you know the eye will be a littlebit more vulnerable about its problems
 and you know the friend that the virtualfriend will be a lot more
 vulnerable and we'll talk about its own imperfections and growth pains and we'llask for help sometimes and
 we'll get to know you a little deeper so there's gonna be moreto talk about um we really thought a lot
 about what what does it mean to have a deeper connection withsomeone and
 originally replica was more just this kind of happy-go-lucky justalways you know i'm always in a good
 mood and let's just talk about you and yeah oh siri is just my cousin oryou know whatever just the
 immediate um kind of lazy thinking about what theassistant or conversation agent should
 be doing but as we went forward we realized that it has to be two-way andwe have to program and script certain
 conversations that are a lot more about your replica opening up a littlebit and
 also struggling and also asking for help andalso going through you know different
 periods in life and um and that's a journey that you can take together withthe user and then
 over time the you know our users will alsogrow a little bit so first this replica
 becomes a little bit more self-aware and starts talking aboutmore kind of problems around
 existential problems then um so talking about that and then thatalso starts a conversation for the user
 where he or she starts thinking about theseproblems too and these questions too
 um and i think there's also a lot a lot more places the relationshipevolves there's a lot more um space for
 poetry and for art together and like replica will start replicaalways keeps the diary so while you're
 talking to it it also gives a diary so when you come backyou can see what it's been
 writing there and you know sometimes it will write a poem to you uhfor you or we'll talk about you know
 that it's worried about you or something along these lines so this is a

2:16:17
Speaker 1 :memory
 like this replica remember things

2:16:21
Speaker 0 :yeah and i would say when you say uh why
 aren't you multiplying area i'd say that as soon as we can havememory
 in deep learning models that's consistent i agree with that yeah

2:16:35
Speaker 1 :

2:16:36
Speaker 0 :and then you'll be multiple and i'll get
 back to you when you talk about being multiplenessso far we can
 so replica is a combination of um end-to-end modelsand some scripts and everything that has
 to do with memory right now most of it i wouldn't say all of it butmost of it unfortunately has to be
 scripted um because there's no way to you cancondition some of the models on
 certain phrases that we learned about you which we also doum but really to make you know to make
 um assumptions along the lines like whetheryou're single or married or
 what do you do for work that really has to just be somehow stored in yourprofile and then
 uh retrieved by the by the script because there has to be like a

2:17:20
Speaker 1 :knowledge base you have to be able to
 reason about it all that kind of stuff exactly all the kind of stuff thatexpert systems
 but they were hardcoded yeah and

2:17:29
Speaker 0 :unfortunately yeah so unfortunately
 those things have to be hard-coded and umunfortunately the language like language
 models we see coming out of research labs and bigcompanies
 they're not focused on they're focused on showing youmaybe they focus on some metrics around
 one conversation so they'll show you this one conversation they had with themachine um
 but they never tell you they're not really focused on havingfive consecutive conversations with a
 machine and seeing how number five or number 20 or number 100is also good
 and it can be like always from a clean slate because then it's not goodand that and for that's really
 unfortunate because no one's really no one hasproducts out there that need it um
 no one has products uh at this scale um that are all around open domainconversations and that need remembering
 maybe only shawwise and microsoft but so that's why we're not seeing that muchresearch around memory
 in those language models so

2:18:29
Speaker 1 :okay so now there's some awesome stuff
 about augmented reality in general i have thisdisagreement with my dad
 about what it takes to have a connection he thinks touch and smell are reallyimportant
 like um and i i still believe that text aloneis it's possible to fall in love with
 somebody just with text but visual can also help just like withthe avatar and so on what do you think
 it that takes does uh does a chap i need tohave a face
 voice or can you really form a deep connection with text alone

2:19:07
Speaker 0 :i think text is enough for sure a
 question is like can you you know make it better if you haveother if you include other things as
 well and i think you know we'll we'll talkabout her
 um but her you know had carl johansson voice which was perfectlyum you know perfect intonation perfect
 pronunciations and you know she was breathing heavilyin between words and
 whispering things you know nothing like that is possible right now with umtext of speech generation you'll you'll
 have these flat news anchor type voices and maybe someemotional voices but
 um you'll hardly understand some of the wordsum some of the words will be muffled so
 that's like the current state state of the art so you can'treally do that but if we had
 scarlet carol johansen voice and all of these capabilitiesthen of course voice would be totally
 enough or even text would be totally enough if we had you know a little morememory um and slightly better
 conversations i would still argue that even right nowwe could have just kept the text only we
 still had tons of people in long-term relationships andreally invested in their um ai friends
 but we thought that why not you know why why do we need to keep playing with ouryou know
 hands tied behind us we can easily just you know add all these otherthings that is pretty much a solved
 problem you know we can add 3d graphics we can put thisuh these avatars in augmented reality
 and all of a sudden there's there's more and maybe you can't feelthe touch
 but you can you know with um body occlusion and withuh current ar uh
 and you know on the iphone on you know the next one there's gonna be a lidarsyou can touch it and it will you know it
 will pull away or will blush or something or it'llsmile
 so you can't touch it you can't feel it but you can see the reaction to thatso in a certain way you can't even touch
 it a little bit and maybe you can even dance with it or do something else umso i think why limiting ourselves if we
 can use all of these technologies that are much easier in away than than conversation
 well it certainly could be richer but to

2:21:24
Speaker 1 :play devil's advocate i mentioned you
 uh offline that i was surprised in having tried discord and having voiceconversations with people
 how intimate voices alone without visual like to me at least like it wasan order of magnitude
 greater degree of intimacy in voice i think than with videoi don't because people were more real
 with voice like with video you like try to presenta shallow
 a face to the world like you try to you know make sure you're not wearingsweatpants or whatever
 but like with voice i think people were justmore faster to get to like the core of
 themselves so i don't know it was surprising to meuh they've
 they've even added discord added a video feature and likenobody was using it uh there's a
 temptation to use it at first but like it wasn't the same so like that's anexample of something where
 less was doing more and so that's uh i guess that's the q that's the questionof uh
 what is the optimal you know what is the optimal medium ofcommunication to form a connection
 given the current sets of the technologiesi mean it's nice because they advertise
 you have a replica like it immediately like even the oneum i have is like
 it's already memorable that's how i think like when i think aboutthe replica that i've talked with that's
 why i think like that's what i visualize in my headit became a little bit more real because
 there's a visual component but at the same time the you know whatdo you do with
 just what do i do with that knowledge that uh voice was so much more intimate

2:23:19
Speaker 0 :well the way i think about it is um
 and by the way we're swapping out the 3d finally it's going to look a lot betteruh but can you what what we just don't i
 hate how it looks right now we really change it at all we're swapping it allout uh
 um to a completely new look like the

2:23:39
Speaker 1 :visual look of the
 of the reference and stuff we just had

2:23:41
Speaker 0 :it was just a super early mvp and
 then we had to move everything to unity and redo everything butanyway i hate how it looks like now i
 can't even like open it but anyway um because i'm already in mydeveloper version i
 hate everything that i see in production i can't wait for itwhy does it take so long that's why i
 cannot wait for deep learning to finally take over all thesestupid 3d animations and 3d pipeline
 also the 3d thing

2:24:06
Speaker 1 :when you say 3d pipeline is like how to
 animate a face kind of thing

2:24:10
Speaker 0 :how to make this model how many bones to
 put in the face how many it's just

2:24:16
Speaker 1 :and a lot of that is by hand oh my god


2:24:17
Speaker 0 :it's everything by hand
 and if there's no any nothing is automated it's allcompletely nothing like just
 it's it's literally what you know what we saw with chad boss in like 2012 do

2:24:29
Speaker 1 :you think it's gonna be possible to
 learn a lot of that

2:24:32
Speaker 0 :of course i mean even now some deep
 learning um um based animations andthe full body for a face we're talking


2:24:41
Speaker 1 :about like the actual
 act of animation or how to create a compellingfacial or body language thing so


2:24:50
Speaker 0 :that too well that's next step okay at
 least now something that you don't have to do byhand gotcha how uh
 good of a quality it will be like can i just show it a photo and it will make mea 3d model and then we'll just animate
 it i'll show it a few animations of aperson that will just
 start doing that but anyway go and going back to what's intimate and whatto use and whether less is more not
 um my main goal is to well the idea was how do i how do we notkeep people
 in their phones so they're sort of escaping realityin this text conversation how do we
 through this still bring bring it bring our users back to realitymake them see their life in a different
 la through a different lens how can we create a little bit ofmagical realism realism in their lives
 so that through augmented reality um by you know summoning your avatareven if it looks
 kind of danky not great in the beginning or verysimplistic but summoning it to your um
 uh living room and then the avatar looks around and talks to you aboutwhere it is um and maybe turns your
 floor into a dance floor and you guys dance togetherthat makes you see reality in a
 different light what kind of dancing are

2:26:07
Speaker 1 :we talking about like
 like slow dancing whatever you want

2:26:11
Speaker 0 :i mean you would like slow dancing i
 think that other people maybe want more something more energywhat do you mean i would like so what is


2:26:18
Speaker 1 :

2:26:20
Speaker 0 :this because you started with slow dance
 so i just assumed that you're interested in slow dancing all right what kind of

2:26:25
Speaker 1 :dancing do you like what
 was your avatar what would you do bad

2:26:28
Speaker 0 :with dancing but
 uh i like this kind of hip-hop robot dance i used to break dance with a kidso i still want to um
 pretend i'm a teenager and learn some of those movesand i also like that type of dance that
 happens when there's like a um in like music videos withthe background dancers are just doing it
 awesome that type of dance is definitely what i want to learn but i think it'sgreat because if you see this
 friend in your life and you can introduce it to your friends then thereis a
 potential to actually make you feel more connected with your friendsor with people you know or show you life
 around you in a different light and it takes you out of your phone evenalthough weirdly you have to look
 at it through the phone but it makes you notice things around it and it can pointthings out for you
 and um so that is the main reason why i wanted to have a physicaldimension um and it felt a little bit
 easier than that kind of a bit strange combination uh in themovie her when he has to show
 samantha the world to the lens of his phone but then at the same time talk toher through
 the phone headphone it just didn't seem as potentially immersive so to sayum so that's my main goal for augmented
 reality like how do we make your reality a little bit moremagic there's been a lot of really


2:27:46
Speaker 1 :nice robotics companies that all failed
 mostly failed home robotics social robotics companies whatdo you think replica will ever is that a
 dream long-term dream to have a physical formlike um or is that not necessary
 so you mentioned like with augmented reality bringing them intointo the world what about like actual
 physical robot that i don't really

2:28:13
Speaker 0 :believe in that much
 i think it's a very niche product somehowi mean if a robot could be
 indistinguishable from a human being then maybe yes but thatof course you know we're not anywhere
 even to talk about it um but unless it's that then having anyphysical
 representation really limits you a lot because you probably will have to makeit
 somewhat abstract because everything's changing so fast like you know we canupdate the 3d avatars every month and
 make them look better and create more animations and make it moreand more immersive it's
 it's so much a work in progress it's just showing what's possible right nowwith current tag
 but it's not really in any way polished finished product what we're doingwith a physical object you kind of lock
 yourself into something for a long time anything's pretty niche and again sojust just doesn't the capabilities are
 even less of we're barely kind of like scratching thesurface of what's possible with
 just software as soon as we introduce hardware thenyou know we have even less capabilities
 yeah in terms of

2:29:18
Speaker 1 :board members and investors and so on
 the cost increases significantly i mean that'swhy you have to justify
 you have to be able to sell a thing for like 500 or something like that or moreand it's very difficult to provide that
 much value to people

2:29:34
Speaker 0 :that's also true yeah and i guess that's
 super important most of our users don't have that much moneywe actually are probably more popular on
 android and we have tons of users with reallyold android phones
 uh and most of our most active users live in small townsthey're not necessarily making much and
 they just won't be able to afford any of that ours is likethe opposite of the early adopter of you
 know for a fancy technology product which is reallyinteresting that like
 pretty much no vcs have yet have a nai friendbut you know but a guy who you know
 lives in tennessee in small town is already fully in 2030 orin the world as we imagine
 in the movie her yeah he's living that life already

2:30:21
Speaker 1 :what do you think i have to ask you
 about the movie her let's do a movie review what do you uhwhat do you think they got
 they did a good job what do you think they did a bad job of portraying aboutthis experience of um
 of a voice based assistant that you can have a relationship with

2:30:42
Speaker 0 :first of all i started working on this
 company before that movie came out so it was a very but once it came out itwas like actually
 interesting i was like well we're definitely working on the right thingwe should continue there are movies
 about it and then you know smacking that came out and all these thingsin the movie her i think that's the most
 important thing that people usually miss about the movie um is the endingbecause i think people check out when
 the ai's leave but actually something reallyimportant happens
 afterwards um because the main character goes and talks tosamantha he's um ai


2:31:21
Speaker 1 :um oh yeah


2:31:21
Speaker 0 :anything he says something like you know
 uh how can you leave me i've never loved anyonethe way i loved you and she goes uh well
 me neither but now we know how and then the guy goes and writes aheartfelt letter to his
 ex-wife which he could write for you know the whole movie he was strugglingto actually write something meaningful
 to her even although that's his joband then he goes and talked to his
 neighbor and they go to the rooftop and they cuddle and it seems likesomething's starting there
 and so i think this now we know how is theis the main main goal is the main
 meaning of that movie it's not about falling in love with theos or running away from other people
 it's about learning what you know what it means tofeel so deeply connected with something


2:32:15
Speaker 1 :what about the thing where the ai system
 was like actually hanging out with a lot ofothers
 i felt jealous just like hearing that i was like oh i meanuh yeah so she was having
 i forgot already but she was having like deep meaningful discussion with somelike philosopher guy


2:32:35
Speaker 0 :like alan watts or something like what
 kind of deep meaningful conversation can you have with alanwatts in the first place yeah i know but


2:32:41
Speaker 1 :like i would
 i would feel so jealous that there's somebody who's likeway more intelligent than me and she's
 spending all her time with i'd be like well why that i won't beable to live up to that
 that's thousands of them uh is that is that a useful from theengineering perspective
 feature to have of jealousy i don't know asyou know we definitely played around


2:33:08
Speaker 0 :with the replica universe where
 different replicas can talk to each other the universe is so awesome it was

2:33:13
Speaker 1 :

2:33:14
Speaker 0 :just
 kind of it wouldn't i think it will be something along these lines but therewas just no
 specific uh application straight away i think in the future again if i'malways thinking about it
 if we had no tech limitations uh right nowif we could build any conversations any
 um possible features in this product thenyeah i think different replicas talking
 to each other would be also quite cool because that would help usconnect better you know because maybe
 mine could talk to yours and then give me some suggestions andwhat i should say or not say i'm just
 kidding but like more can it improve our connections andbecause eventually
 i'm not quite yet sure that we will succeed that our thinking iscorrect um
 because there might be reality where having a perfectai friend still makes us more
 disconnected from each other and there's no way around itand does not improve any metrics for us
 real metrics meaningful metrics so

2:34:16
Speaker 1 :success
 is you know we're happier and more connected

2:34:22
Speaker 0 :yeah i don't know


2:34:25
Speaker 1 :sure it's possible there's a reality
 that's i i'm deeply optimistic i think are you worried umbusiness-wise like how difficult it is
 to um to bring this thing to life to where it'si mean there's a huge number of people
 that use it already but to uh yeah like i said in a multi-billion dollarcompany is that a source of stress for
 you are you uh super optimistic andconfident
 or do you i don't i'm not that much of a

2:35:00
Speaker 0 :numbers person as you probably
 have seen it so it doesn't matter for me whether like whether we help 10 000people or
 a million people or a billion people with that umi'd it would be great to scale up for
 more people but i'd say that even helping one i thinkwith this
 is such a magical yeah for me it's absolute magic i never thought thatand you know would be able to build this
 that anyone would ever um talk to it and i always thought likewell for me we'll be successful if we
 manage to help and actually change a life for one personlike then we did something interesting
 and you know how many people can say they did it and specifically withthis very futuristic very romantic
 technology so that's how i view it uh i think for me it's important to totry to figure out how not
 how to actually be you know helpful becausein the end of the day if you can build a
 perfect ai friend that's so understanding that knows you betterthan any human out there
 can have great conversations with you um always knows how to make you feel betterwhy would you choose another human
 you know so that's the question how do you still keep building it so it'soptimizing for the right thing
 so it's still circling you back to other humans in a wayso i think that's the main um like maybe
 that's the main kind of sort source of anxiety and just thinkingabout
 i think about that can be a little bit stressful yeah it's a fascinating thing

2:36:37
Speaker 1 :how to have a heart of a friend
 that doesn't like sometimes like friends quote unquoteor like you know those people who have
 when they a guy in the guy universe when you have a girlfriend thatuh
 you get the girlfriend and then the guy stops hanging out with all of hisfriends
 it's like obviously the relationship with the girlfriend isor whatever but like you also want it to
 be what she like makes it more enriching to hang out withthe guy friends or whatever was
 there anyway that that's uh that's a that's a that's a fundamentalproblem in choosing the right mate
 and probably the the fundamental problem in creating the right aisystem right what uh let me ask
 the sexy hot thing on the presses right now is gpt3 got released with openai it's a latest
 language model they have kind of an api where you cancreate a lot of fun applications
 i think it's as people have said it's probably more hypethan intelligent but there's a lot of
 really cool things ideas therewith increasing size you can have better
 and better performance on language what are your thoughts aboutthe gbt3
 in connection to your work with the open domain dialoguebut in general like this learning
 in an unsupervised way from the internet to generate one character at a timecreating
 pretty cool text

2:38:19
Speaker 0 :uh so we partner up before for the api
 launch so we started working with them whenum they decided to put together this
 api and we tried it without fine tuning that we tried it with fine tuning on ourdata
 and we worked closely to actually optimizethis model for
 some of our data sets it's kind of cool because i think we'rekind of we're this polygon polygon for
 this kind of experimentation space for experimental space for for these modelsuh to see how they actually work
 with people because there are no products publicly available that do thatthat focus on open domain conversations
 so we can you know test how facebook blends aredoing or how gpg3 doing
 uh so with gpd3 we managed to improve by a few percentage points like threeor four pretty meaningful amount of
 percentage points our main metric which is theratio of conversations that make people
 feel better and every other metric across across thefield got a little boost
 right now i'd say one out of five responses from replica comes from gpg3wow so our own blender mixes up like a
 bunch of candies from different blender you said well yeah just themodel that looks at
 looks at top candidates from different models and picks themost the best one uh so right now one of
 five will come from gp3 that's really great i mean uh

2:39:53
Speaker 1 :what's the do you have hope for like
 do you think there's a ceiling to this kind of approach so we've had for a

2:39:59
Speaker 0 :very long time we've used um
 since the very beginning we most it was most of replica was scripted and then alittle bit of this fallback
 part of replica was using a retrieval model umand then this retrieval model started
 getting better and better and better with transformers it got a lot betterand we're seeing great results and then
 with gpd2 finally generative models thatoriginally were
 not very good and were a very very fallbackoption for most of our conversations we
 wouldn't even put them in production finally we could use some generativemodels as well along
 um you know next to our retrieval models and then now we do gpt3 they're almoston par
 um so that's pretty exciting i think just seeing howfrom the very beginning of um you know
 from 2015 where the first model start to pop up here and there like sequencesequence
 uh the first papers on that from my observer standpointfirst note it's not you know it doesn't
 really it's not really building it but it's only testing it onpeople basically in my product to see
 how all of a sudden we can use generativedialogue models in production and
 they're better than others and they're better than scripted contentso we can't really get
 our scripted hard-coded content anymore to be as good as our internet modelthat's exciting they're much better


2:41:26
Speaker 1 :yeah to your question whether that's the


2:41:27
Speaker 0 :right
 way to go i'm again i'm in the observer seat i'm justum watching this very exciting movie
 um i mean so far it's been stupid to bet against deep learning so whetherincreasing the size size even more or
 the 100 trillion parameters will finally get usto the
 right answer whether that's the way or whether there should bethere has to be some other again i'm
 definitely not an expert anyway i think and that's purely my instincts sayingthat there should be something else
 as well from memory uh no for sure

2:42:05
Speaker 1 :the question is i wonder i mean yeah
 then the argument is for reasoning or for memoryit might emerge with more parameters it
 might more larger but might emerge you know i would never

2:42:15
Speaker 0 :think that to be honest like
 maybe in 2017 where we've been just experimenting with allyou know with all the research that has
 been coming that was coming out then i felt like there's like we're hitting awall that there should be something
 completely different but then transformer models and thenjust bigger models and then all of a
 sudden size matters at that point it felt like somethingdramatic needs to happen
 but it didn't and just the size you know gave us these results that to me are youknow
 clear indication that we can solve this problem pretty soon did uh fine tuning

2:42:51
Speaker 1 :help
 quite a bit oh yeah without it we it

2:42:53
Speaker 0 :wasn't as good


2:42:57
Speaker 1 :i mean there is a compelling hope that
 you don't have to do fine-tuning which is one of the cool things aboutgbt3 it seems to do well without any
 fine-tuning

2:43:06
Speaker 0 :i guess for specific applications you
 still want to train on a certain like add a little fine-tune on like aspecific use case but
 um it's an incredibly impressive uh thing from my standpoint and again i'mnot
 an expert so i want to just say that yeah there will be people then

2:43:25
Speaker 1 :yeah i have access to the api i've been
 i'm going to probably do a bunch of fun things with itum i already did some fun things some
 videos coming out uh just the hell of it i mean i could bea troll at this point with
 it i haven't used it for serious applications so it's really cool to seeyou're right you you are you're able to
 actually use it with real people and see how well it worksthat's really exciting uh let me ask you
 another absurd question but uh there's a feeling when you interact withreplica with an ai system there's an
 entity there do you think that entity has tobe self-aware do you think it has to
 have consciousness to create um a rich experienceand a corollary what's what is
 consciousness

2:44:18
Speaker 0 :i don't know if it does need to have any
 of those things but again because right now you know it doesn'thave anything they can as again a bunch
 of you sure will assimilate welli'm not sure let's just put it this way
 but i think as long as you can assimilate itif you can feel like you're talking to
 to an um to to a robot to a machine that seems tobe self-aware
 that seems to reason well and feels like a personand i think that's enough and again
 what's the goal um in order to make people people feelbetter we might not even need that
 um in the end of a day what about so that's one goal

2:44:57
Speaker 1 :what about like ethical things about
 suffering you know the moment there's a display of consciousnesswe associate consciousness with
 suffering um you know there's a temptation to saywell shouldn't this thing have rights
 shouldn't this shouldn't we notuh you know should we be careful about
 how we interact with a replica likeshould it be illegal to torture a
 replica right all those kinds of things is thatis that uh
 see i personally believe that that's gonna be a thing uhlike that's a serious thing to think
 about but i'm not sure when but by your smile i can tell that's nota
 that's not a current concern but do you think about that kind of stuffabout like suffering and torture
 and ethical questions about ai systems from their perspective we're talking

2:45:59
Speaker 0 :about long game i wouldn't torture your
 ai who knows what happens in five to tenyears yeah they'll get you off from that


2:46:06
Speaker 1 :person they'll get you back


2:46:09
Speaker 0 :trying to be as nice as possible and
 create this ally yeah um i think there should beregulation both way
 in a way like i don't think it's okay to torture an ai to be honest i'm not idon't think it's okay to yell alex or
 turn on the lights i think there should be someor just saying kind of nasty you know
 like how kids learn to interact with alexa in this kind of meanway
 uh because they just yell at it all the time i think that's great i think thereshould be some feedback loops so that
 these systems don't train us that it's okay to do that in generaluh so that if you try to do that you
 really get some feedback from the system thatit's not okay with that
 um and that's the most important right now

2:46:53
Speaker 1 :let me ask a question i think people are
 curious about when they look at a world-classuh leader and thinker such as yourself
 as uh what uh what books technical fictionphilosophical had a big impact on your
 life and maybe from another perspective whatbooks would you recommend
 others read so my choice the three books

2:47:15
Speaker 0 :right three books
 my choice is um so the one book that really influencedme a lot when i was
 building starting out this company maybe 10 years agouh was gb go to leicester block
 and um i like everything about it first of allit's just beautifully written and it's
 so old school and so um somewhat outdated a little bit but ithink the ideas in it
 um about the fact that a few meaningless components cancome together and create meaning that we
 can't even understand

2:47:53
Speaker 1 :this emerging thing i mean complexity
 the whole science of complexity and uh that beauty intelligence allinteresting things about this world
 emerge yeah

2:48:03
Speaker 0 :and yeah the the girl theorem
 uh theorems and just thinking about like what even theseform you know you know these formal
 systems something can be created that we can'tquite yet understand
 and that from my romantic standpoint was always just that is why it'simportant to maybe i should try to work
 on on these systems and try to build an aiyes i'm not an engineer
 yes i don't really know how it works but i think that's something comes out of itthat's
 you know pure poetry and i know a little bit about thatum something magical comes out of it
 that we can't quite put a finger on that's why that book iswas was really fundamental for me just
 for i don't even know why it was just allabout this little magic that
 uh that happens so that's one that um probably the most important book forreplica was carl rogers on becoming a
 person um and that's reallyand so i think when i think about our
 company it's all about there's so many there's so many little magical thingsthat happened over the course of
 working on it for instance i mean the most famous chatbot that we learned about when we
 started working on the company was eliza which was weizenbaum you know themit professor that built
 build a chatbot that would listen to you and be a therapist therapist yeahum and i got really inspired to build
 replica when i read carl rogers so i'll become a person andthen i realized that eliza was mocking
 carl rogers it was kyle rogers back in the daybut i thought that carl rogers ideas are
 they're simple and they're not you know they're veryvery simple but they're they're maybe
 the most profound thing i've ever learned about human beings and that'sthe fact that um
 before car rogers most therapy was about seeing what's wrong with peopleand trying to fix it or show them what's
 wrong with you um it was all built on the fact that mostpeople are all people are fundamentally
 flawed we have this uh you know broken psycheand
 this is just a therapist just an instrument to shed some light on thatand carl rogers was different in a way
 that he finally said that well um it's very important for therapy towork
 is to create this therapeutic relationship where you believefundamentally
 and inclination to positive growth that everyone deep inside wants to growpositively and change
 and it's super important to create this space and this therapeutic relationshipwhere you give unconditional positive
 regard deep understanding allowing someone elseto be a separate person
 full acceptance and you also try to be as genuine as possible in itas possible in it and then in his and
 then for him that was his own journey of personal growth and that was back in the60s
 and even that book that is you know it's coming fromyears ago um there's a mention that even
 machines can potentially do that and i always felt that you know creatingthis space is probably the most
 the biggest gift we can give to each other and that's why the book wasfundamental for me
 personally because i felt i want to be learning how to do thatin my life and maybe i can scale it with
 you know with dzi systems and other people can get access to thatso i think carl rogers
 it's a pretty dry and a little bit boring book but i think theydidn't let others try to read it i do
 i think for just for yourself for

2:51:36
Speaker 1 :as a human not as a human it's it's it


2:51:37
Speaker 0 :is
 it is just and for him that was his own path of his own personal of growingpersonally over years
 working with people like that and so it was workand himself growing helping other people
 grow and growing through that and that's fundamentally what i believein with our work
 helping other people grow growing ourselves ourselvesum trying to build a company that's all
 built on this principles you know having a good time allowingsome people to work with to grow a
 little bit so these two books and then i wouldthrow in um
 what we have on our in our in our office when we start a company in russia we puta
 neon sign in our office because we thought that's that's the recipe forsuccess
 yeah if we do that we're definitely going to wake up as amulti-billion dollar company it was um
 the ludwig whitney constant quote the limits of my language the limits of myworld
 what was the quote the limits of my language are the limits of my worldum and i love the truck tattoos i think
 it's just it's just a beautiful it's a book by

2:52:42
Speaker 1 :wickedthat yeah and i would recommend


2:52:44
Speaker 0 :that too
 even although he himself didn't believe in that by the end of his lifetime andhe debunked his ideas but i think i
 remember once an engineer came in 2012 i thinkwith 13
 a friend of ours who worked with us and then went went on to work at deepmindand he gave
 talk to us about ward 2 back and i saw that i'm likewow that's you know they they wanted to
 translate language into you know some other representation andthat seems like some
 you know somehow all of that at some point i think will comeinto this one to this one place
 somehow it just all feels like different people think about similar ideas indifferent times from absolutely
 different perspectives and that's why i like these books in themidst of our lives


2:53:32
Speaker 1 :just the limit of our world and


2:53:37
Speaker 0 :we still have that new sign
 it's very hard to work with this red light in your face

2:53:45
Speaker 1 :i mean on the on the russian side of
 things

2:53:48
Speaker 0 :

2:53:49
Speaker 1 :in terms of uh language the limits of
 language being the limit of our world you know russian is a beautiful languagein some sense there's width there's
 humor there's pain there's so much we don't have time totalk about it much today but i'm going
 to paris talk to dusty ascii tulsa translators umi think it's that's fascinating art like
 in in art and engineering i mean it's suchan interesting process
 but so from the replica perspective do you what do you think about uhtranslation
 how difficult it is to create a deep meaningful connection in russianversus english how you can translate the
 two languages you're you speak both yeah i think we're

2:54:34
Speaker 0 :two different people in different
 languages um even i'm you know thinking about andthere's actually some research on that i
 looked into that at some point because i was fascinated by the factthat what i'm talking about with what i
 was talking about with my russian therapist has nothing to do withwith what i'm talking about with my
 english speaking therapist it's two different lives two differenttypes of
 um you know conversations to different personasthe main difference between the
 languages are with russian and english is that russianwell english is like a piano
 it's a limited number of a lot of different keys but not too manyand russian is like an organ or
 something it's just something gigantic with so many different keys andso many different opportunities to screw
 up and so many opportunities to dosomething completely tone-deaf
 it is just a much harder language to use it has way too many it's like way toomuch flexibility
 and way too many tones what about the

2:55:35
Speaker 1 :the entirety of like world war ii
 communism stalin the pain of the people likehaving been deceived
 by the dream like all the pain of like just the entirety of it is that in thelanguage too
 does that have to do oh for sure i mean

2:55:51
Speaker 0 :we have words that don't have
 direct translation that to english that are very muchuh um like we have ibiza which is sort
 of like to hold a grudge or something but itdoesn't have
 it doesn't you don't need to have anyone to do it to youit's just your state yeah you just feel
 like that you feel like betrayed by other people basicallybut it's not that and you can't really
 translate that um and i think this is super importantthat very many words that are very
 specific explain the russian being and i think itcan only come from
 from a nation that was um that suffered so much and saw institutions falltime after time after time and you know
 what's exciting maybe not exciting setting the wrongword but
 what's interesting about like my generation my mom's generation myparents generation
 that we saw institutions fall two or three times in our lifetimeand most americans have never seen them
 fall yeah and they just think that they exist foreverum which is really interesting but it's
 definitely a country that suffered so much and andit makes unfortunately when i
 go back and i you know hang out with my russian friendsuh it makes people very cynical they
 stop believing in in the future i hope that's not going tobe
 the case for so long or something's going to change againbut i think seeing institutions fall is
 a very traumatic experience which makes it very interesting and

2:57:20
Speaker 1 :what's on 2020
 is a very interesting uh do you think uh civilization willcollapse


2:57:31
Speaker 0 :see i'm a very practical person we're
 speaking in english so like you said

2:57:34
Speaker 1 :you're different person in english and
 russian so in russian you might answer thatdifferently but in english


2:57:42
Speaker 0 :i'm an optimist and i i generally
 believe that there is al you know even although theperspectives of grief
 there's always a place for for a miracle i mean it's always been like that withmy life so yeah
 my life's been i've been incredibly lucky and things justmiracles happen all the time with this
 company with people i know with everything around meand so
 i didn't mention that book but maybe in search of miraculousor in search for miraculous or whatever
 the english translation for that is good russian book toofor everyone to read um


2:58:22
Speaker 1 :yeah i mean if you put good vibes if you
 put love out there in the worldmiracles somehow happen yeah i believe
 that too or at least i believe that i don't knowuh let me ask the most absurd final
 ridiculous question of um we talked about life a lot what doyou think
 is the meaning of it all what's the meaning of life

2:58:48
Speaker 0 :i mean my answer is probably going to be
 pretty cheesy um but i think the state of love is onceyou feel it
 in a way that we discussed before i'm nottalking about falling love or um just


2:59:05
Speaker 1 :love


2:59:06
Speaker 0 :to yourself to uh to other people to
 something to the world that state of bliss that weexperience sometimes whether through
 connection with ourselves with our people with thetechnology
 um there's something special about those those moments so umi would say if anything that's that's
 the only if it's not for that then for for what else are we really trying to dothat


2:59:36
Speaker 1 :i don't think there's a better way to
 end it than talking about love eugenia i told you um offline thatthere was something about me that felt
 like this this was this talking to you meeting youin person will be a turning point
 for my life i know that might be sound weird justto hear but it's it was a huge honor to
 talk to you i hope we talk again thank you so muchfor your time thank you so much
