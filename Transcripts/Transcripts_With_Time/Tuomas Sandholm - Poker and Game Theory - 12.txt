0:00:00
Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 Thomas sent home he's a professor same you and co-creator of lebra's which isthe first AI system to be top human


0:00:10
Speaker 1 :players in the game of heads-up No Limit


0:00:11
Speaker 0 :Texas Hold'em he has published over 450


0:00:13
Speaker 1 :

0:00:14
Speaker 0 :papers on game theory and machine
 learning including a best paper in 2017 at nips now renamed to new reps which is

0:00:23
Speaker 1 :where I caught up with him for this


0:00:26
Speaker 0 :conversation his research and companies


0:00:26
Speaker 1 :have had wide reaching impact in the


0:00:30
Speaker 0 :real world especially because he and his
 group not only proposed new ideas but

0:00:36
Speaker 1 :also build systems to prove that these


0:00:40
Speaker 0 :ideas work in the real world this
 conversation is part of the MIT course on artificial general intelligence and

0:00:46
Speaker 1 :

0:00:47
Speaker 0 :the artificial intelligence podcast if
 you enjoy subscribe on youtube itunes or simply connect with me on Twitter at LexFriedman spelled Fri D and now here's my


0:00:57
Speaker 1 :

0:00:58
Speaker 0 :conversation with Thomas sent home can
 you describe at the high level the game of poker Texas Hold'em heads-up TexasHold'em for people who might not be
 familiar at this card game yeah happy to

0:01:13
Speaker 1 :so heads up No Limit Texas Hold'em has
 really emerged in the AI community as a main benchmark for testing theseapplication independent algorithms for
 imperfect information game solving and this is a game that's actually played byhumans you don't see that much on TV or
 casinos because well for obvious reasons but you do see it in some expert levelcasinos and you see it in the best poker
 movies of all time it's actually an event in the World Series of Poker butmostly it's played online and typically
 for pretty big sums of money and this is a game that usually only experts play soif you recall to your home game on a
 Friday night it probably is not gonna be hits up no Limit Texas Hold'em it mightbe no let me it takes us Hold'em in some
 cases but typically for a big group and it's not as competitive well heads upmeans it's two-player so it's really
 like me against you Am Iyou better much like chess or or or go
 in that sense but an imperfect information game which makes it muchharder because I have to deal with
 issues of you knowing things that I don't know and I know things that youdon't know
 instead of pieces being nicely laid on the board for both of us to see

0:02:30
Speaker 0 :so in Texas Hold'em there's a two cards
 that you only see the game on to you yeah there is they gradually lay outsome cards that add up overall to five
 cards that everybody can see yeah the imperfect nature of the information isthe two cards that you're holding on


0:02:47
Speaker 1 :front yeah so as you said you know you
 first get two cards in private each and then you this a betting round then youget three clubs in public on the table
 then there's a betting round then you get the fourth card in public on thetable they're spitting around then you
 get the five fifth card on the table there's a bending drop so there's atotal of four betting rounds and four
 torrontés of information revelation if you will the only the first tranche isprivate and they omits public from there


0:03:15
Speaker 0 :and this is probably probably by far the
 most popular game in AI and just the general public in terms of imperfectinformation so it's probably the most
 popular spectator game to watch right so which is why it's a super exciting gametackle so it sits on the order of chess
 I would say in terms of popularity in terms of AI setting it as the bar ofwhat is intelligence
 so in 2017 labret does how do you pronounce it Liberato lebra das lebra

0:03:52
Speaker 1 :does beats little laughing they're a


0:03:53
Speaker 0 :little bit Latin LeBron is beat a few
 for expert human players can you describe that event what you learnedfrom it what was it like what was the
 process in general for people who have not read the papers and study yeah so

0:04:09
Speaker 1 :the event was that we invited four of
 the top 10 players with these are specialist players in heads-up no LimitTexas Hold'em which is very important
 because this game is actually quite different than the the multiplayerversion we brought me in to Pittsburgh
 to play at the reverse casino for twenty days we wanted to get ahundred and twenty thousand hands in
 because we wanted to get statistical significance so it's a lot of hands forhumans to play even for this top pros
 who play fairly quickly normally so we couldn't just have one of them play somany hands twenty days they were playing
 basically morning to evening and he raised two hundred thousand as a littleincentive for them to play and the
 setting was so that they didn't all get fifty thousand we actually paid them outbased on how they did against the AI
 each so they had an incentive to play as hard as they could whether they're wayahead the way behind or right at the
 mark of beating the AI and you don't

0:05:13
Speaker 0 :

0:05:15
Speaker 1 :make any money unfortunately right no we
 can't make any money so so originally a couple of years earlier I actuallyexplored whether we could actually play
 for money because that would be of course interesting as well to playagainst the top people for money but the
 Pennsylvania Gaming Board said no so so if we couldn't so this is much like anexhibit like for a musician or a boxer
 or something like that

0:05:38
Speaker 0 :nevertheless you're keeping track of the
 money and brought us one close to two million dollars I think so so if thereif it was for real money if you were
 able to earn money that was a quite impressive and inspiring achievementjust a few details what what were the
 players looking at I mean were they behind the computer what was the

0:06:01
Speaker 1 :interface like yes there they were
 playing much like they normally do these top players when they play this gamethey play mostly online so they used to
 playing through what UI yes and they did the same thing here so there was thislayout you could imagine there's a table
 on the screen this the the human sitting there and then there's the AI sittingthere and the the screen source
 everything is happening the cards coming out and so the bets being made and wealso had the betting history for the
 human so if the human for what what had happened in the ham so far they couldactually reference back
 and and and so forth is there a reason

0:06:36
Speaker 0 :they were given access to the betting


0:06:41
Speaker 1 :history for well we just uh it's a it
 didn't really matter that they wouldn't have forgotten anyway these are topquality people but we just want to put
 out there so it's not a question for human for getting and the AI somehowtrying to get advantage of better memory


0:06:56
Speaker 0 :so what was that like I mean that was an
 incredible accomplishment so what did it feel like before the event did you havedoubt hope
 where was your confidence at yeah that's

0:07:08
Speaker 1 :great so a great question so eighteen
 months earlier I had organized the similar brains versus AI competitionwith our previous a I call clerical and
 we couldn't beat the humans so this time around it was only eighteen months laterand I knew that this new AI Lovato's was
 way stronger but it's hard to say how you'll do against the top humans beforeyou try so I thought we had about a
 50/50 shot and the international betting sites put us a us as a four to one orfive to one underdog so it's kind of
 interesting that people really believe in people and I get over AI not justpeople people don't just believe over
 believing themselves but they have overconfidence in other people as wellcompared to the performance of AI and
 yeah so we were afford to 105 to 108 beating the humans in a row we werestill 50/50 on the international betting


0:08:06
Speaker 0 :sites do you think there's something
 special and magical about poker and in the way people think about it in a senseyou have I mean even in chess there's no
 Hollywood movies poker is this the star of many movies and there's this feelingthat certain human facial expressions
 and body language eye movement all these tells are critical to poker you can lookinto somebody's soul understand their
 betting strategy and so on there so that's probably why the possibly do youthink that is why people have a
 confidence that humans will outperform because AI systems cannot inconstruct perceive these kinds of tells
 they're only looking at betting patterns and and nothing else the bettingpatterns and and statistics so what's


0:09:00
Speaker 1 :

0:09:01
Speaker 0 :more important to you if you step back
 and human players human versus human what's the role these tells of theseideas that we romanticize yeah so I


0:09:13
Speaker 1 :split it into two parts so one is why do
 humans trust he much more than AI and all have overconfidence in humans yes Ithink that's that's not really related
 to tell a question it's just that they've seen these top players how goodthey are and they're really fantastic so
 it's just hard to believe therefore that the Navy I could beat them yeah so Ithink that's where that comes from and
 and that's actually maybe a more general lesson about the AI that until you'veseen it over perform a human it's hard
 to believe it it could but then the tails a lot of these top players they'reso good at hiding tails that among the
 top players it's actually not really worth it for them to invest a lot ofeffort trying to find tails in each
 other because there's a so good at hiding them so yes at the kind of Fridayevening game tells are gonna be a huge
 thing you can read other people and if you're a good reader you you'll readthem like an open book but at the top
 levels of poker no details become a list of the much much smaller and smalleraspect of the game as you go to the top


0:10:23
Speaker 0 :levels the the amount of strategies the
 amount of possible actions is is very large ten to the power of one hundredplus so there has to be some I've read a
 few the papers related it has it has to form some abstractions of various handsand actions so what kind of abstractions
 are effective for the game of poker yeah

0:10:48
Speaker 1 :so you're exactly right so when you go
 from a game tree that's ten to the 161 especially in an imperfect informationgame it's way too large to solve
 directly even with our fastest ik finding algorithms so you wanna abstractit first and abstraction in games is
 much trickier than abstraction in mdps or other single agent settings becauseyou have these abstraction pathologies
 that if I have a finer grained abstraction the strategy that I can getfrom that for the real game might
 actually be worse than the strategy I can get from the coarse-grainedabstraction if you have to be very


0:11:28
Speaker 0 :careful now the the kinds of
 abstractions just to zoom out we're talking about there's the handsabstractions and then there's betting
 strategies yeah what I think actions

0:11:37
Speaker 1 :yeah baiting access or so there's
 information obstruction to talk about general games information abstractionwhich is the abstraction of what chance
 does and this would be the cards in the case of poker and then there's actionabstraction which is abstracting the
 actions of the actual players which would be bits in the case of poker

0:11:59
Speaker 0 :yourself and the other players yes


0:12:01
Speaker 1 :yourself and other players and for
 information abstraction we were completely automated so these were theseare algorithms but they do what we call
 potential aware abstraction where we don't just look at the value of the handbut also how it might materialize in the
 good or bad hands over time and it's a certain kind of bottom-up process withinteger programming there and clustering
 and various aspects how do you build build this abstraction and then in theaction abstraction there it's largely
 based on how humans other and other AIS have played this game in the past but inthe beginning we actually use an
 automated action abstraction technology which is provably convergent that itfinds the optimal combination of eight
 sizes but it's not very scalable so we couldn't use it for the whole game butwe used it for the first couple of


0:12:59
Speaker 0 :betting actions so what's more important
 the strength of the hand so the information retraction or the how youplay them the actions does
 you know the romanticized notion again is that it doesn't matter what hands youhave that the actions the betting may be
 the way you win no matter what hands you

0:13:20
Speaker 1 :have yeah so that's why you have to play
 a lot of hands so that the role of luck gets smaller so you could otherwise getlucky and get some good hands and then
 you're gonna win the match even with thousands of hands you can get luckybecause there's so much variance in No
 Limit Texas Hold'em because if we both go all-in it's a huge stack or variantso there are these massive swings in No
 Limit Texas Hold'em so that's why you have to play not just thousands but overa hundred thousand hands don't get
 statistical significance let me ask

0:13:55
Speaker 0 :another way this question if you didn't
 even look at your hands but they didn't know that the your opponents didn't knowthat how well would you be able to do oh


0:14:06
Speaker 1 :that's a good question there's actually
 I heard this story that this is Norwegian female poker player goal andat uber stud who's actually won a
 tournament by doing exactly that but that would be extremely rare so so Icannot really play well the hands do


0:14:24
Speaker 0 :have some role to play oh yes so LeBron
 is does not use as far as I understand a used learning methods deep learning isthere room for learning in you know
 there's no reason why lab artist doesn't you know combined with an alphago typeapproach for estimating the quality for
 function estimator what are your thoughts on this maybe as compared toanother algorithm which I'm not that
 familiar with deep stack the the engine that does use deep learning that it'sunclear how well it does but
 nevertheless uses deep learning so what are your thoughts about learning methodsto aid in the way that teller Broadus
 plays the game of poker yeah so as you

0:15:09
Speaker 1 :said Lee barratto's did not use learning
 methods and played very well without them since then we have actuallyactually here we have a couple of papers
 on things that do use learning technique Saxon so and deep learning in particularand the sort of the way you're talking
 about where it's learning an evaluation function but in imperfect informationgames unlike let's say in Co or now now
 also in chess and shogi it's not some sufficient to learn an evaluation for astate because the value of an
 information set depends not only on the exact state but it also depends on bothplayers beliefs like if I have a bad
 hand I'm much better off if the opponent thinks I'm have a good hand and viceversa if I have a good hand I'm much
 better off if the opponent believes I have a bad hand so the value of a stateis not just a function of the cards it
 depends on if you will the path of play but only to the extent that is capturedin the belief distributions so so that's
 why it's not as simple as as it is imperfect information games another oneI'd say it's simple there either it's of
 course very complicated computationally there too but at least conceptually it'svery straightforward there's a state
 there's an evaluation function you can try to learn it here you have to dosomething more and what we do is in one
 of these papers we're looking at allowing where we allow with theopponent to actually take different
 strategies at the leaf of the search tree as F if you will and and that is adifferent way of doing it and it doesn't
 assume therefore a particular way that the opponent plays but it allowsopponent to choose from a set of
 different continuation strategies and that forces us to not be too optimisticin our local head search and that's
 that's one way you can do sound look ahead search in imperfect informationgames which is very different difficult
 and in us you were asking about deep stack what they did it was verydifferent than what we do either in Lee
 brothers or in this new work they were gender and Umrah generatingvarious situations in the game then they
 were doing Luca head from there to the end of the game as if that was a startof a different game and then they were
 using deep learning to learn those values of those states but the stateswere not just the physical states they
 include the belief distributions when

0:17:52
Speaker 0 :you talk about look ahead for deep stack
 or with libertas does it mean considering every possibility that thegame can involve is that we're talking
 about extremely sort of like this exponentially growth of a tree yes so

0:18:06
Speaker 1 :we're talking about exactly that
 much like you do in Alpha Beta search or want to crawl to research but withdifferent techniques so there's a
 different search algorithm and then we have to deal with the leaves differentlyso if you think about what Lee brothers
 did we didn't have to worry about this because we only did it at the end of thegame so we would always terminate into a
 real situation and we would know what to payout this it didn't do thisdepth limited loka heads but now in this
 new paper which is called depth limited I think it's called depth limitedresearch for imperfect information games
 we can actually do sound depth limited look at it so we can actually startedwith a look ahead
 from the beginning of the game on because that's too complicated to do forthis whole long game
 so in Lee brothers we were just doing it

0:18:57
Speaker 0 :for the end so and then the other side
 this belief distribution so is it explicitly modeled what kind of beliefsthat the opponent might have yeah yeah


0:19:07
Speaker 1 :it is explicitly modeled but it's not
 assumed the beliefs are actually output not input of course the starting beliefsare input but they just fall from the
 rules of the game because we know that the dealer deals uniformly from the dickso I know that every pair of cards that
 you might have is equally likely I know that for a factthat's as follows from the rules of the
 game of course except the two cards that I have I know you don't have those yesyou have to take that into account
 that's called card removal and that's

0:19:40
Speaker 0 :very important is the dealing always
 coming from a single deck in the heads up so you can assume single deck know

0:19:46
Speaker 1 :that if some if if I have the ace of
 spades I know you don't have an ace of spades

0:19:54
Speaker 0 :okay so in the beginning your belief is
 basically the fact that it's a fair dealing of hands but how do you adjuststart to adjust that belief well that's


0:20:02
Speaker 1 :a where this beauty of games here it
 comes so nash equilibrium which john nash introduced in 1950 introduces whatrational play is when you have more than
 one player and these are pairs of strategies where strategies arecontingency plans one for each player so
 neither player wants to deviate to a different strategy giventhat the other doesn't deviate but as a
 side effect you get the beliefs from Bayes rule so Nash equilibrium reallyisn't just deriving in these imperfect
 information games Nash equilibrium doesn't just define strategies it alsodefines beliefs for both us and it
 defines beliefs for each state so at the each state it's if they take allinformation sets at each information set
 in the game there's a set of different states that we might be in but I don'tknow which one we're in Nash equilibrium
 tells me exactly what is a probability distribution over those real worldstates in my mind how does naturally


0:21:08
Speaker 0 :give you that distribution so why I'll


0:21:11
Speaker 1 :do a simple example so you know the game
 rock-paper-scissors so we can draw it as player 1 moves first and then player 2moves but of course it's important that
 player 2 doesn't know what player 1 moved otherwise player 2 would win everytime so we can draw that as an
 information set where player 1 makes one of three moves first and then there's aninformation set for player 2 so player 2
 doesn't know which of those nodes the world is it but once we know thestrategy for player 1 Nash equilibrium
 will say that you play 1/3 Rock 1/3 paper 1/3 caesars from that I can derivemy beliefs of the information set that
 they wanted 1/3 wants it though so Bayes

0:21:54
Speaker 0 :gives you that basis you but is that
 specific to a particular player or is it is there something you quickly update

0:22:04
Speaker 1 :with the game theory isn't really player
 specific so that's what also why we don't need any data we don't need anyhistory how these particular humans
 played in the past or how any AI or even had played before it's all aboutrationality so we just think the AI just
 thinks about what would a rational opponent do and what would I do if Iwere right I am rational and that that's
 that's the idea of game theory so it's really a data free opponent free

0:22:35
Speaker 0 :approach sir comes from the design of
 the game as opposed to the design of the

0:22:39
Speaker 1 :player exactly if there's no opponent
 modeling per se I mean we've done some work on combining opponent modeling withgame theory so you couldn't exploit weak
 players even more but that's another strand and in the Lee brothers we didn'tturn that on because I decided that
 these players are too good and when you start to exploit an opponent you'lltypically open yourself up self up to
 exploitation and these guys have so few holes to exploit and they're world'sleading experts in counter exploitation
 so I decided that we're not gonna turn that stuff on actually I saw a few

0:23:09
Speaker 0 :papers exploiting opponents it sound
 very interesting to explore do you think there's room for exploitation generallyoutside of LeBron us is is there subject
 or people differences that could be exploited maybe not just in poker but ingeneral interactions negotiations all
 these other domains that yours

0:23:33
Speaker 1 :considering yeah I definitely we've done
 some work on that and I really like their work at hybridize is the two soyou figure out what would a rational
 opponent do and by the way that's safe in these zero-sum games two playerzero-sum games because if the opponent
 does something irrational yes it might show throw off my beliefs but the amountthat the player can gain by throwing off
 my belief is always less than they lose by playing poorly so so it's safe butstill if somebody's weak as a player you
 might want to play differently to exploit them more so that you can thinkabout it this way a game theoretic
 strategies are unbeatable but it doesn't maximally beat the other opponent so thewinnings per hand might be better with a
 different strategy and the hybrid is that you start from a game theoreticapproach and then as you gain data from
 about the opponent in certain parts of the game tree that in those parts of thegame tree you start to tweak your
 strategy more and more towards exploitation while still staying fairlyclose to the game theoretic strategy so
 as to not open yourself up to exploitation too much

0:24:47
Speaker 0 :how do you do that do you try to vary up
 strategies make it unpredictable it's like what is ittit-for-tat strategies in prisoner's
 dilemma or well it doesn't that that's a

0:25:00
Speaker 1 :repeated game kind of prisoner's dilemma
 repeats it games but but even there there's no proof that says that that'sthe best thing but experimentally it
 actually does does does well so what

0:25:13
Speaker 0 :kind of games are there first of all I
 don't know if this is something that you could just summarize there's perfectinformation games or all the
 informations on the table there is imperfect information games there'srepeated games you play over and over
 there's zero-sum games there's nonzero-sum games yeah and then there'sa really important distinction you're
 making two-player versus more players so

0:25:41
Speaker 1 :what are what other games out there and


0:25:42
Speaker 0 :what's the difference for example with
 this two-player game versus more players yeah what are the key differences right

0:25:52
Speaker 1 :here so let me start from the the basic
 so a repeated game is a game where the same exact game is played over and overin these extensive form games where
 think about three form maybe with these information says to represent incompleteinformation you can have kind of
 repetitive interactions even repeated games are a special case of that by theway but if the game doesn't have to be
 exactly the same selectively sourcing all trips yes we kind of see it the samesupply base year to year but what I'm
 buying is a little different every time and the supply base is a littledifferent every time and so on so it's
 not really repeated so to find a purely repeated game is actually very rare inthe world so they're really a very
 coarse model of what's going on then if you move up from repeat just repeatedsimple repeated matrix games not all the
 way to extensive form games but in betweenthey're stochastic games where you know
 this these think about it like these little matrix gamesand when you take an action and your
 home takes an action they determine not which next state I'm going to next gameI'm going to but the distribution over
 next games where I might be going to so so that's the stochastic game but it'slike matrix games repeated stochastic
 games extensive form games that is from less to more general and and poker is anexample of the last one so it's really
 the most general setting extensive form games and that's kind of what the AIcommunity has been working on and being
 benched marked on with this heads-up No Limit Texas Hold'em

0:27:38
Speaker 0 :can you describe extensive form games
 what was the motto here yeah so if you

0:27:42
Speaker 1 :imagine with the tree form so it's
 really the tree form like in chess there's a search tree versus a matrix isa matrix yeah and that's the new matrix
 is called the matrix form or by matrix form or normal form game and here youhave the tree form so you can actually
 do certain types of reasoning there that you'll lose the information when you goto normal form there's a certain form of
 equivalence like if you go from three form and you say it every possiblecontingency plan is the strategy then I
 can actually go back to the normal form but I lose some information from thelack of sequentiality then the
 multiplayer versus two-player distinction is an important oneso two-player games in zero-sum are
 conceptually easier and computationally easier there's still huge like this onethis one but they're conceptually easier
 and computationally easier in that conceptually you don't have to worryabout which equilibrium is the other guy
 going to play when there are multiple because any equilibrium strategy is abest response to any other equilibrium
 strategy so I can play a different equilibrium from you and we'll still getthe right values of the game that falls
 apart even with two players when you have general some games even without

0:29:01
Speaker 0 :cooperation just even without


0:29:03
Speaker 1 :cooperation so there's a big gap from
 two player zero-sum to two-player general sum or even to three playerzero-sum that's that's a big gap
 at least in theory can you maybe not

0:29:14
Speaker 0 :mathematically provide the intuition why
 it all falls apart with three or more players it seems like you should stillbe able to have a Nash equilibrium that
 yeah that's instructive that holds okay

0:29:30
Speaker 1 :so it is true that all finite games have
 a Nash equilibrium so this is what your Nash actually proved so they do have aNash equilibrium that's not a problem
 the problem is that there can be many and then there's a question of whichequilibrium to select so and if you
 select your strategy from a different equilibrium and I select mind then didwhat does that mean I and in this non
 zero sum games we may lose some joint benefits we hope by being just simplystupid we could actually both be better
 off if we did something else yes and in three player you get other problems alsolike collusion that maybe you and I can
 get up on a third player and we can do radically better by colluding so thatthere are lots of issues that come up
 there

0:30:22
Speaker 0 :so no Brown student you workers on this
 has mentioned I looked through the AMA and read it he mentioned that theability of poker players to collaborate
 will make the game he was asked the question of how would you make the gameof poker or both of you were asked the
 question how would you make the game of pokerbeyond being solvable by current AI
 methods and he said that there's not many ways of making poker more difficultbut collaboration or cooperation between
 players would make it extremely difficult so can you provide theintuition behind why that is if you
 agree with that idea yeah so we've done

0:31:05
Speaker 1 :a lot of work coalitional games and we
 actually have a paper here with my other student cappella Farina and some othercollaborators on after net nips on that
 actually just came back from the poster session where we present life so whenyou have a collusion it's a it's a
 different problem yes and it typically gets even harder theneven the game representations some of
 the game representations don't really allow go to computation so we actuallyintroduced a new game representation for
 for that is that kind of cooperation

0:31:38
Speaker 0 :part of the model is are you do you have
 do you have information about the fact that other players are cooperating or isit just this chaos that where nothing is


0:31:50
Speaker 1 :known so there's some something's
 unknown can you give an example of a

0:31:52
Speaker 0 :collusion type game or Z you select


0:31:56
Speaker 1 :breach that so think about bridge it's
 like when you and I are on a team our payoffs are the same the problem isthat we can't talk so so when I get my
 cards I can't whisper to you what my cards are that would not be allowed sowe have to somehow coordinate our
 strategies ahead of time and only ahead of time and then there are certainsignals we can talk about but they have
 to be such that the other team also understands them so so that that'sthat's an example where the coordination
 is already built into the rules of the game but in many other situations likeauctions or negotiations or diplomatic
 relationships poker it's not really built-in but it still can be veryhelpful for the coders I've read you


0:32:45
Speaker 0 :right somewhere the negotiations you
 come to the table with prior like a strategy that like that you're willingto do and not willing to do those kinds
 of things so how do you start to now moving away from poker movie beyondpoker into other applications like
 negotiations how do you start applying this to other and to other domainsyeah even real world domains that you've
 worked on yeah I actually have two

0:33:12
Speaker 1 :start-up companies doing exactly that
 one is called strategic machine and that's for kind of build applicationsgaming sports all sorts of things like
 that any applications of this to business and to sports and to gaming tovarious types of things for in finance
 electricity markets and so on and the other is called strategy robot where weare taking this to military secure
 the cyber security and intelligence applications I think you worked a little

0:33:44
Speaker 0 :bit in how he put it advertisement sort
 of suggesting ad kind of thing yeah

0:33:55
Speaker 1 :auction that's another component
 optimized markets optimized but that's much more about a combinatorial marketand optimization based technology that's
 not using these game theoretic reasoning

0:34:07
Speaker 0 :technologies I think okay so what sort
 of high level do you think about our ability to use game theoretic conceptsto model human behavior do you think do
 you think human behavior is amenable to this kind of modeling so outside of thepoker games and where have you seen it
 done successfully in your work I'm not

0:34:28
Speaker 1 :sure the goal really is modeling humans
 like for example if I'm playing a zero-sum game yes I don't really carethat the opponent is actually following
 my model of rational behavior because if they're not that's even better for me

0:34:46
Speaker 0 :right so so they see with the opponents
 and games there's a the prerequisite is that you've formalized the interactionin some way that can be amenable to
 analysis and you've done this amazing work with mechanism design designinggames that have certain outcomes but so
 I'll tell you an example for my for my world of autonomous vehicles right we'restudying pedestrians and pedestrians and
 cars negotiating this nonverbal communication there's this weird andgame dance of tension where pedestrians
 are basically saying I trusted you won't kill me and so as a jaywalker I willstep onto the road even though I'm
 breaking the law and there's this tension and the question is we reallydon't know how to model that well in
 trying to model intent and so people sometimes bring up ideas of game theoryand so on do you think that aspect of
 human behavior can use these kinds of imperfect information approachesmodeling
 how do we how do you start to attack a problem like that when you don't evenknow how the game design the game to
 describe the situation in order to solve it okay so I haven't really thought

0:36:04
Speaker 1 :about jaywalking but one thing that I
 think could be a good application in an autonomous vehicles is the following solet's say that you have fleets of
 autonomous cars operated by different companies so maybe here's the way morefleet and here's the uber fleet if you
 think about the rules of the road they define certain little rules but thatstill leaves a huge strategy space open
 like as a simple example when cars merge you know how he must merge you know theyslow down and look at each other and try
 to I try to merge wouldn't it be better if these situations would all repeatpre-negotiated so we can actually merge
 at full speed and we know that this is the situation this is how we do it andit's all gonna be faster but there are
 way too many situations to negotiate manually so you could do use automatednegotiation this is the idea at least
 you could use automated negotiation to negotiate all of these situations ormany of them in advance and of course it
 might be that hey maybe you're not gonna always let me go firstmaybe you said okay well in these
 situations all let you go first but in exchange you're gonna give me - how muchyou're gonna let me go first in this
 situation yes so it's this huge combinatorialnegotiation and do you think there's


0:37:20
Speaker 0 :room in that example of merging to model
 this whole situation is an imperfect information game or do you really wantto consider it to be a perfect no that's


0:37:30
Speaker 1 :a good question yeah that's a good


0:37:34
Speaker 0 :question I'm paid the price of assuming
 that you don't know everything yeah I

0:37:40
Speaker 1 :don't know it's certainly much easier
 games with perfect information are much easier so if you can get away with ityou should but if the real situation is
 of imperfect information then you're going to have to deal with in forimperfect information great so what


0:37:55
Speaker 0 :lessons have you learned the annual
 computer poker competition an incredible accomplishment of AI you know you lookat the history of deep blue
 go these kind of moments when I stepped up in an engineering effort and ascientific effort combined to beat the
 best human players so what do you take away from this whole experience whathave you learned about designing it has
 systems that play these kinds of games and what does that mean for sort of AIin general for the future of IAI
 development yeah so that's a good

0:38:30
Speaker 1 :question so there's so much to say about
 it I do like this type of performance oriented research although in my groupwe go all the way from like idea to
 theory to experiments to big system fielding the commercialization so wespend that spectrum but I think that in
 a lot of situations in AI you really have to build the big systems andevaluate them at a scale before you know
 what works and doesn't and we've seen that in the computational game theorycommunity that there are a lot of
 techniques that look good in the small but then they cease to look good in thelarge and we've also seen that there are
 a lot of techniques that look superior in theory and I really mean in terms ofconvergence rates better like
 first-order methods better convergence rates like the CFR based basedalgorithms yet the CFR pay based
 algorithms are the fastest in practice so it really tells me that you have totest this in reality the theory isn't
 tight enough if you will to tell you which algorithms are better than theothers and you have to look at these
 things that in the large because any sort of projections you do from thesmall and at least in this domain be
 very misleading so that that's kind of from from a kind of science andengineering perspective from personal
 perspective it's been just a wild experience in that with the first pokercompetition the first or first brains
 versus AI man-machine poker competition that we organized there had been by theway for other poker games there had been
 previous competitions but this was for heads up No Limit this was the first andI probably became the most hated person
 in the world of Poker and I didn't mean to III size that they cracked in the

0:40:15
Speaker 0 :

0:40:16
Speaker 1 :game for yeah it was a lot of people
 felt that it was a real threat to the whole game the wholeexistence of the game if AI becomes
 better than humans people would be scared to play poker because there arethe superhuman AI is running around
 taking their money and you know all of that so so I just it's just reallyaggressive just in the comments were
 super aggressive I got everything it's just short of death threats do you

0:40:42
Speaker 0 :think the same was true for chess
 because right now they just completed the World Championships and chess andhumans just started ignoring the fact
 that there's AI systems now that I'll perform humans and they still enjoy thegame is still a beautiful game that's


0:40:55
Speaker 1 :what I think yeah and I think the same
 thing happens in poker and so I didn't think of myself as somebody was gonnakill the game and I don't think I did
 yeah I've really learned to love this game I wasn't a poker player before butlearn so many new ones is about it from
 these AIS and they've really changed how the game is played by the way so theyhave these very Martian ways of playing
 poker and the top humans are now incorporating those types of strategiesinto their own play so if anything to me
 our work has made poker a richer more interesting game for humans to play notsomething that is gonna steer him as
 away from it entirely just a quick

0:41:35
Speaker 0 :comment and something you said which is
 if I may say so in academia is a little bit rare sometimes it's pretty brave toput your ideas to the test in the way
 you described saying that sometimes good ideas don'twork when you actually try to apply them
 at scale and so where does that come from I mean what if you could do aadvice for people what what drives you
 in that sense were you always this way I mean it takes a brave person I guess iswhat I'm saying to test their ideas and
 to see if this thing actually works against human top human players and so

0:42:12
Speaker 1 :on yeah I don't know about brave but it
 takes a lot of work it takes a lot of work and a lot of time to organize domake something big and to organize an
 event and stuff like that and what

0:42:23
Speaker 0 :drives you in that effort because you
 could still I would argue get a best paper award and nips as you did in 17without doing this that's right yes


0:42:32
Speaker 1 :and so so in general I believe it's very
 important to do things in in the real world and at scale and that's reallywhere the the the pudding if you will
 proof is in the pudding that's what that's where it is in this particularcase it was kind of a competition
 between different groups and for many years as to who can be the first one tobeat the top humans that heads up No
 Limit Texas Hold'em so it became it became kind of a like a competition whocan get there yeah so a little friendly


0:43:10
Speaker 0 :competition could be I can do wonders


0:43:14
Speaker 1 :for progress yes so the topic of


0:43:16
Speaker 0 :mechanism design which is really
 interesting also kind of new to me except as an observer if I don't knowpolitics and any I'm an observer of
 mechanisms but you write in your paper an automated mechanism design that Iquickly read so mechanism design is
 designing the rules of the game so you get a certain desirable outcome and youhave this work on doing so in an
 automatic fashion as opposed to fine-tuning it so what have you learnedfrom those efforts if you look say I
 don't know at complex it's like our political system can we design ourpolitical system to have in an automated
 fashion to have outcomes that we want can we design something like trafficlights to be smart where it gets
 outcomes that we want so what are the lessons you draw from that work yeah so

0:44:16
Speaker 1 :I still very much believe in the
 automated mechanism design direction yes but it's not a panaceathere are impossibility results in
 mechanism design saying that there is no mechanism that accomplishes objective Xin Class C so so they it's not gonna
 there's no way using any mechanism design tools manual or automatedto do certain things in mechanism design
 he can't describe that again so meaning

0:44:43
Speaker 0 :there it's impossible to achieve that


0:44:48
Speaker 1 :yeah yes it was likely impossible so so
 so these are these are not statements about human ingenuity who might come upwith something smart these are proofs
 that if you wanna accomplish properties X in Class C that is not to oppose withany mechanism the good thing about
 automated mechanism design is that we're not really designing for a class we'redesigning for specific settings at the
 time so even if there's an impossibility result for the whole class it justdoesn't mean that all of the cases in
 the class are impossible it just means that some of the cases are impossible sowe can actually carve these islands of
 possibility within these known impossible classes and we've actuallydone that so what one of the famous
 results in mechanism design is a Meyer sham set its weight theorem for pi RogerMyerson and Mark Satterthwaite from 1983
 so it's an impossibility of efficient trade under imperfect information weshow that you can in many settings avoid
 that and get the efficient trade anyway

0:45:51
Speaker 0 :depending on how they design the game
 okay so depending how you design the

0:45:54
Speaker 1 :game and of course it's not it doesn't
 in any way any way contradict to impossibility result or impossibilityresults is still there but it just finds
 spots within this impossible class where in those spots you don't have timepossibility sorry if I'm going a bit


0:46:13
Speaker 0 :philosophical but what lessons you draw
 towards like I mentioned politics or human interaction and designingmechanisms for outside of just these
 kinds of trading or auctioning or purely

0:46:29
Speaker 1 :

0:46:30
Speaker 0 :formal games our human interaction like
 a political system what how do you think it's applicable to yeah politics or tobusiness to negotiations these kinds of
 things designing rules that have certain

0:46:49
Speaker 1 :outcomes yeah yeah I do think so have


0:46:52
Speaker 0 :you seen success that successfully done


0:46:54
Speaker 1 :yes and really oh you mean mechanism
 design or automated make automated mechanism design but so so mechanismdesign itself has had fairly limited
 success so far there are certain cases but most of the real-world situationsare actually not sound from a mechanism
 design perspective even in those cases where they've been designed by veryknowledgeable mechanism design people
 the people are typically just taking some insights from the theory andapplying those insights into the real
 world rather than applying the mechanisms directly so one famousexample of is the FCC spectrum auctions
 so I've also had a small role in that and very good economists have been whereexcellent economists have been working
 on that with no game theory yet the rules that are designed in practicethey're they're such that bidding
 truthfully is not the best strategy usually mechanism design we try to makethings easy for the participants so
 telling the truth is the best strategy but but even in those very high stakesauctions where you have tens of billions
 of dollars worth of expect from being auctioned truth-telling is not the beststrategy and by the way nobody knows
 even a single optimal bidding strategy for those auctions what's the challenge

0:48:14
Speaker 0 :of coming up with an optimum because
 there's a lot of players and there's a

0:48:19
Speaker 1 :lot of players but many items for sale
 and the these mechanisms are such that even with just two items or one itembidding truthfully wouldn't be the best
 strategy if you look at the history of

0:48:31
Speaker 0 :AI it's marked by seminal events and
 alphago being a world champion human go player I would put librettist winningthe heads of no-limit hold'em as one of
 such event thank you and what do you thinkis the next such event whether it's in
 your life or in the broadly AI community that you think might be out there thatwould surprise the world so that's a


0:49:01
Speaker 1 :great question and I don't really know
 the answer in terms of game solving hits up No Limit Texas Hold'em really was theone remaining widely agreed-upon
 benchmark so that was the big milestone now are there other things yes certainlythere are but there there is not one
 that the community has kind of focused on so what could be other things thereare groups working on StarCraft there
 are groups working on dota2 these are video games yes or you could have likediplomacy or Hanavi you know things like
 that these are like recreational games but none of them are really acknowledgedthat's kind of the main next challenge
 problem like chess or go or heads-up No Limit Texas Hold'em was so I don'treally know in the game solving space
 what is or what will will be the next benchmarkI hope kind of hope that there will be a
 next benchmark because really the different groups working on the sameproblem really drove these application
 independent techniques for put very quickly over ten years do you think

0:50:08
Speaker 0 :there's an open problem that excites you
 that you start moving away from games into real world games like say the stockmarket trading yeah that's that's kind


0:50:18
Speaker 1 :of how I am so I am probably not going
 to work as hard on these recreational benchmarks I'm doing to startups on gamesolving technology strategic machine and
 strategy robot and we're really interested in pushing this stuff intopractice what do you think would be


0:50:38
Speaker 0 :really you know a powerful result that
 would be surprising that would be if you can say I mean you know five years tenyears from now something that
 statistically you would say is not very likely but if there's a breakthroughwhat achieve yeah so I think that


0:51:02
Speaker 1 :overall we're in a very different
 situation in game theory than we are in let's say machine learning yesso in machine learning it's a fairly
 mature technology and it's very broadly applied and proven success in the realworld in game solving there are almost
 no applications yet we have just become superhuman whichmachine learning you could argue
 happened in the 90s if not earlier and at least some supervised learning atcertain complex supervised learning
 applications now I think a next challenge problem Iknow you're not asking about this way
 you're you're asking about the technology breakthrough but I think thebig big breakthrough is to be able to
 show it hey maybe most of let's say military planning or most of businessstrategy will actually be done
 strategically using computational game theory that that's what I would like tosee as a next five or ten year goal
 maybe you can explain to me again

0:51:59
Speaker 0 :forgive me if this is an obvious
 question but you know machine learning methods neural networks are suffer fromnot being transparent not being
 explainable a game theoretic methods you know Nash equilibria do they generallywhen you see the different solutions are
 they when you talk about military operations are they once you see thestrategies do they make sense that they
 explainable or do they suffer from the same problems as neural networks do so

0:52:28
Speaker 1 :that's that's a good question I would
 say a little bit yes and no and what I mean by that is that these games areethic strategies let's say Nash
 equilibrium it has provable properties so it's unlike let's say deep learningwhere you kind of cross your fingers
 hopefully it'll work and then after the fact when you have the weights you'restill crossing your fingers and I hope
 it will work here you know that the solution quality is there this provableor Souls from quality guarantees now
 that doesn't necessarily mean that the strategies are human understandablethat's a whole other problem so that's
 also I think it deep learning and computational game theory are in thesame boat in that sense that both are
 difficult to understand but at least the game theoretic techniques they have thisguarantees of guarantee quality so did


0:53:20
Speaker 0 :you see business operations to achieve
 your corporations or even military in the future being at least the strongcandidates being proposed by automated
 systems do you see that yeah I do I do

0:53:34
Speaker 1 :but that's more of a really belief than
 a substantiated fact depending on where

0:53:40
Speaker 0 :you land and optimism or pessimism
 that's a relief to me that's an exciting future especially if they're provablethings
 in terms of optimality so looking into the future there's a a few folks worriedabout the especially you look at the
 game of poker which is probably one of the last benchmarks in terms of gamesbeing solved they they worry about the
 future and the existential threats of artificial intelligence so the negativeimpact in whatever form on society is
 that something that concerns you as much are you more optimistic about thepositive impacts of AI oh I am much more


0:54:22
Speaker 1 :optimistic about the positive impacts so
 just in my own work what we've done so far we run the nationwide kidneyexchange hundreds of people are walking
 around alive today who would it be and it's increased employment you had youhave a lot of people now running kidney
 changes and at the transplant centers interacting with the kidney exchange youhave extra surgeons nurses
 anesthesiologists hospitals all of that as so so employment is increasing fromthat and the world is becoming a better
 place another example is combinatorialsourcing auctions we did 800 large-scale
 combinatorial sourcing auctions from 2001 to 2010 in a previous startup ofmine called combine it and we increased
 the supply chain efficiency on that sixty billion dollars of spend by twelvepoint six percent so that's over six
 billion dollars of efficiency improvement in the world and this isalso like shifting value from somebody
 to somebody else just efficiency improvement like in trucking less emptydriving so there's less waste less
 carbon footprint and so on it's a huge

0:55:34
Speaker 0 :positive impact in the near term but
 sort of to stay in it for a little longer because I think game theory is arole to play here well let me actually


0:55:44
Speaker 1 :come back and tell you this is one thing
 I think Asia is also going to make the world much safer so so so that's anotheraspect that often gets overlooked well


0:55:54
Speaker 0 :let me ask this question maybe you can
 speak to the the safer so I talked to max tegmark is do a Russell who are veryconcerned about
 the resume yeah and often the concern is about value misalignment so AI systemsbasically working operating towards
 goals that are not the same as human civilization human beings so it seemslike game theory has a role to play
 there to to make sure the values are aligned with human beings I don't knowif that's how you think about it if not
 how do you think AI might help with this problem how do you think a i'ma make theworld safer yeah I think this value


0:56:40
Speaker 1 :misalignment is a fairly theoretical
 worry and I haven't really seen it in it because I do a lot of real applicationsI don't see it anywhere
 the closest I've seen it was the following type of mental exercise reallywhere I had this argument in the late
 80s when we were building these transportation optimization systems andsomebody had heard that it's a good idea
 to have high utilization of assets so they told me that hey why don't you putthat as objective and we didn't even
 pull it as an objective because I just showed him it you know if you had thatas your objective the solution would be
 to load your trucks full and driving circles nothing would ever get deliveredyou'd have a hundred percent utilization
 so yeah I know this phenomenon I've known this for over 30 years in but I'venever seen it actually be a problem
 reality in reality and yes if you have the wrong objective the AI will optimizethat to the hilt and it's gonna fit more
 than some human who's kind of trying to so within a half-baked way with somehuman insight to but I just haven't seen
 that materialize in practice there's this gap that you actually put your

0:57:50
Speaker 0 :finger on very clearly just now between
 theory and reality that's very difficult to put into words I think it's what youcan theoretically imagine the worst
 possible case or even yeah I mean bad cases and what usually happens inreality so for example to me maybe it's
 something you can comment on having grown up and I had grew up in theSoviet Union you know there's currently
 10,000 nuclear weapons in the world and for many decades it's theoreticallysurprising to me that the nuclear war is
 not broken out do you think about this aspect from a game theoretic perspectivein general why is that true why in
 theory you could see how things would go terribly wrong and somehow yet they havenot yeah how do you think so so I do


0:58:45
Speaker 1 :think that about that a lot I think the
 biggest two threats that we're facing as mankind one is climate change and theother is nuclear war so I saw so those
 are my main two worries that they're worried about and I've tried to dosomething about climate I thought about
 trying to do something for climate change twice actually before two of mystartups had actually commissioned
 studies of what we could do on those things and we didn't really find a sweetspot but I'm still keeping an eye out on
 that if there's something where we could actually provide a market solution oroptimization solution or some other
 technology solution to problems right nowlike for example pollution critic
 markets was what we were looking at then and it was much more the lack ofpolitical will by those markets were not
 so successful rather than bad market design so I could go in and make abetter market design but that wouldn't
 really move the needle on the world very much if there's no political will and inthe u.s. you know the market at least
 the Chicago market was just shut down and and so on so it and then it doesn'treally help create your market design
 was there any nuclear side it's more so

0:59:52
Speaker 0 :global warming is more encroaching


0:59:58
Speaker 1 :

1:00:00
Speaker 0 :problem you know nuclear weapons have
 been here it's an obvious problem has just been sitting there so how do youthink about what is the mechanism design
 there that just made everything seem stable and are you still extremely

1:00:15
Speaker 1 :worried I am still extremely worried so
 you probably know the simple game theory of mad so solar so this was a mutuallyassured destruction and it's like it
 doesn't require any computation with small matrices you can actually convinceyourself that the game is such that
 nobody wants to initiate yeah that's a very coarse-grained analysis and itreally works in a situation where you
 have two superpowers or small number of superpowers now things are verydifferent you have a smaller nuke so the
 threshold of initiating is smaller and you have smaller countries and non nonnation actors who make it Nokes and so
 on so it's I think it's riskier now than it was maybe ever before and what idea

1:00:59
Speaker 0 :application by I you've talked about a
 little bit but what is the most exciting to you right nowI mean you you're here at nips europe's
 now you have a few excellent pieces of work but what are you thinking into thefuture with several companies you're
 doing what's the most exciting thing or one of the exciting things the number

1:01:22
Speaker 1 :one thing but for me right now is coming
 up with these scalable techniques for game solving and applying them into thereal world they're still very interested
 in market design as well and we're doing that in the optimized markets but I'mmost interested if number one right now
 is strategic machine strategy robots getting that technology out there andseeing as you were in the trenches doing
 applications what needs to be actually filled what technology gap still need tobe filled so it's so hard to just put
 your feet on the table and imagine what needs to be done but when you'reactually doing real applications the
 applications tell you what needs to be done and I really enjoy that interaction

1:02:02
Speaker 0 :is it a challenging process to apply
 some of the stay the are techniques you're working on and and having thethe various players in industry or the
 military or people who could really benefit from it actually use it what'sthat process like of you know in
 autonomous vehicles will work with automotive companies and they're in inmany ways they're a little bit
 old-fashioned it's difficult they really want to use this technology there'sclearly will have a significant benefit
 but the systems aren't quite in place to easily have them integrated in terms ofdata in terms of compute in terms of all
 these kinds of things so deuce is that one of the bigger challenges that you'refacing and how do you tackle that
 challenge yeah I think that's always a

1:02:51
Speaker 1 :challenge that that's gonna slowness and
 inertia really of let's do things the way we've always done it you just haveto find the internal champions that the
 customer who understand that hey things can't be the same way in the futureotherwise bad things are going to happen
 and it's in order most vehicles it's actually very interesting that the carmakers are doing that then they're very
 traditional but at the same time you have tech companies who have nothing todo with cars or transportation like
 Google and Baidu really pushing on autonomous cars I find it fascinatingclearly you're super excited about


1:03:25
Speaker 0 :actually these ideas having an impact in
 the world in terms of the technology in terms of ideas and research theirdirections that you're also excited
 about whether that's on the some of the approaches you talked about for theimperfect information games whether it's
 applying deep learning just some of these problems is there something thatyou're excited in in the research side
 of things yeah yeah lots of different

1:03:50
Speaker 1 :things in the game solving so solving
 even bigger games games will you have more hidden action of the play youractions as well poker is a game where
 really the chance actions are hidden or some of them are hidden but the playeractions are public
 the multiplayer games of various sorts collusion opponent exploitation all andeven longer games some games that
 basically go forever but they're not repeated so seek extensive phone gamesthat go forever whoa what what would
 that even look like how do you represent that how do you solve that what's an

1:04:33
Speaker 0 :example of a game like that or is this
 some of the stochastic games the imagine let's say business strategy so it's and

1:04:37
Speaker 1 :not just modeling like a particular
 interaction but thinking about the business from here to eternityor I think or let's let's say military
 strategy so it's not like war is going to go away how do you think aboutmilitary strategy that's going to go
 forever how do you even model that how do you know whether a move was good thatyou somebody made and and and so on so
 that that's kind of one direction I'm also very interested in learning muchmore scalable techniques for integer
 programming so we had a nice email paper this summer on that for the firstautomated algorithm configuration paper
 that has theoretical generalization guarantees so if I see these manytraining examples and I told my
 algorithm in this way it's going to have good performance on the realdistribution which have not seen so
 which is kind of interesting that you know algorithm configuration has beengoing on now for at least 17 years
 seriously and there has not been any generalization theory before well this

1:05:46
Speaker 0 :is really exciting and it's been it's a
 huge honor to talk to you thank you so much to us thank you for bringinglivadas to the world and all the great
 work you're done well thank you very
