 Langer you have a bit of a love for magic do you see a connection betweenmagic and science I do


0:03:12
Speaker 1 :I think magic can surprise you and you
 know and I think science can surprise you and there's something magical aboutabout science I mean making discoveries
 and things like that you know so on then

0:03:24
Speaker 0 :on the magic side is there some kind of
 engineering scientific process to the tricks themselves do you see becausethere's a duality to it one is your the
 your you're sort of the person inside there knows how the whole thing workshow the universe of the magic trick
 works and then from the outside observer which is kind of the role of thescientists you the people that observe
 the magic trick don't know at least initially anything that's going on doyou see that kind of duality well I


0:03:55
Speaker 1 :think the duality that I see is
 fascination you know I think of it you know when I watch Magic myself I'malways fascinated by it sometimes it's a
 puzzle to think how it's done but just the sheer fact that's something that younever thought could happen does happen
 and I think about that in science too you know sometimes you it's somethingthat you might dream about and helping
 to discover maybe you do or in some way

0:04:21
Speaker 0 :or form what is the most amazing magic
 trick you've ever seen

0:04:26
Speaker 1 :well there's one I like which is called
 the invisible pack and the way it works is you have this pack and you hold it upbut first you say to somebody is this is
 invisible and this deck and you say well shuffle it and I shuffle it but you knowthere's sort of make-believe and then
 you say okay I'd like you to pick a card any cardand show it to me and you show it to me
 and and I look at it and let's say it's the three of hearts and said we'll putit back in the deck but what I'd like
 you to do is turn it upside down from every other cards in the deck so theythey do that imaginary and I said you
 want to shuffle it again they shuffle it and I said well so there's still onecard upside down from every other card
 in the deck I said what is that and they said all three hearts so it just sohappens in my back pocket I have this
 deck it's you know it's a real deck I show - you know it's justopen it up and there's just one card
 upside down and it's the three of hearts

0:05:25
Speaker 0 :

0:05:25
Speaker 1 :

0:05:26
Speaker 0 :and and you can do this trick I can i-55


0:05:30
Speaker 1 :don't I would have probably brought it


0:05:33
Speaker 0 :all right well beautiful let's get into
 the into the science as of today you have over two hundred ninety fivethousand citation an h-index of 269
 you're one of the most sighted people in history and the most cited engineer inhistory and yet nothing great I think is
 ever achieved without failure so the interesting part what rejected papersideas efforts in your life or most
 painful or had the biggest impact on

0:06:05
Speaker 1 :your life
 well it's interesting I mean I've had plenty of rejection to you know I but Isuppose one way I think about this is
 that when I first started and this certainly had an impact both ways youknow I first started we made two big
 discoveries and they were kind of interrelated I mean one was I was tryingto isolate with my post-doctorate
 advisor Judah Folkman substances that could stop blood vessels from growingand nobody done that before and so that
 was part a let's say a Part B is we had to develop a way to study that and whatwas critical to study that was to have a
 way to slowly release those substances for you know more than a day I you knowmaybe months and that had never been
 done before either so we published the first one we sent to nature the journaland they rejected it and then we sent it
 revise tenets of science and they accepted it and the other the oppositehappened we sent it to science and they
 rejected it and then we sent it to nature and they accepted it but I haveto tell you when we got the rejections
 it was really upsetting I thought you know I did some really good work and dr.Folkman thought we've done some really
 good work and and but it was very depressing to you know get rejected like

0:07:25
Speaker 0 :that if you can linger on just the
 feeling or the thought process when you get the rejection especially early on inyour career
 what I mean you don't know now people know you as uh as as a brilliantscientist but at the time I'm sure
 you're full of self-doubt and did you believe that maybe this idea is actuallyquite terrible that it could been done
 much better or is the underlying confidence what was the feelings well

0:07:55
Speaker 1 :you feel to feel depressed that I felt
 the same way when I got grants rejected which I did a lot in the beginning Iguess part of me you know you have
 multiple emotions one is being sad and being upset and also being maybe alittle bit angry because the you to feel
 the reviewers didn't get it but then as I thought about it more I thought wellmaybe I just didn't explain it well
 enough and you know that you go through stages and so you say well okay I'llexplain it better next time and
 certainly you get reviews and what you get the reviews you see what they eitherdidn't like or didn't understand and
 then you try to incorporate that into

0:08:34
Speaker 0 :your next versions mmm you've given
 advice to students to do something big do something that really can change theworld rather than something incremental
 how did you yourself seek out such ideas is there a process is there a sort of arigorous process or is it more


0:08:51
Speaker 1 :spontaneous it's more spontaneous I mean
 part of its exposure to things part of its seeing other people like I mentioneddr. Folkman he was my post doctoral
 adviser he was very good at that you could sort of see that he had big ideasand I certainly met a lot of people who
 didn't and and I think you could spot an idea that might have potential when yousee it you know because it could have a
 very broad implications where a lot of people might just keep doing derivativestuff and so but it's not something that
 I've ever done systematically I don't

0:09:25
Speaker 0 :think so in the space of ideas how many
 are just when you see them it's just magic it's something that you see thatcould be impactful if if if you dig


0:09:37
Speaker 1 :deeper yeah it's it's sort of hard to
 say because there's there's multiple levels of ideasone type of thing is like a new you know
 creation like that you could engineer tissues for the first time or makedishes from scratch from the first time
 but another thing is really just deeply understanding something and that'simportant too so and and that may lead
 to other things so sometimes you could think of a new technology or I thoughtof a new technology but other times
 things came from just the process of trying to discover things so it's neverand and and you don't necessarily know
 like people talk about aha moments but I don't know if I've I mean I certainlyfeel like I've had some ideas that I
 really like but it's taken me a long time to go from the thought process ofstarting it to all of a sudden knowing


0:10:35
Speaker 0 :that it might work so if you if you take
 drug delivery for example is the notion is the initial notion kind of a verygeneral one that we should be able to do
 something like this yeah and then you start to ask the questions of well howwould you do it and then and then
 digging and digging and digging I think

0:10:52
Speaker 1 :that's right I think it depends I mean
 there are many different examples the example I gave about delivering largemolecules which we used to study these
 blood vessel inhibitors I mean there we had it invent something that would dothat but other times it's it's it's
 different sometimes it's really understanding what goes on in terms ofunderstanding the mechanisms and so it's
 it's it's not a single thing and there are many different parts to it you knowover the years we've invented different
 discover different principles for aerosols for delivering you know genetictherapy agents you know all kinds of


0:11:30
Speaker 0 :things so let's explore some of the key
 ideas you've touched on in your life some let's let's start with the basicsokay so first let me ask how complicated
 is the biology and chemistry of the human body from the perspective oftrying to affect some parts of it in a
 positive way it's but so that you know for me especially coming from the fieldof computer science and computer
 engineering and robotics it's that the human body is exceptionallycomplicated and how the heck you can
 figure out anything is amazing well I

0:12:01
Speaker 1 :agree with you I think it's super
 complicated I mean we're still just scratching the surface in many ways butI feel like we have made progress in
 different ways and some of its by really understanding things like we were justtalking about other times you know you
 might or somebody might we or others might invent technologies that might behelpful on exploring that and I think
 over many years we've understood things better and better but we still have sucha long ways to go are there I mean if


0:12:30
Speaker 0 :you just look are there other things
 that are there knobs that are reliably controllable about the human body if youcould service is there is it so if you
 start to think about controlling various aspects of when we talk about drugdelivery a little bit but controlling
 various aspects chemically of the human body is there a solid understandingacross the populations of humans that
 are solid reliable knobs that can be

0:13:03
Speaker 1 :controlled I think that's hard to do
 about on the other hand whenever we make a new drug or medical device to acertain extent we're doing that you know
 in a small way what you just said but I don't know that they're that they'regreat knobs I mean and we're learning
 about those knobs all the time but if there's a biological pathway orsomething that you can affect or
 understand I mean then that might be

0:13:27
Speaker 0 :such a knob so what is pharmaceutical
 drug how do you do how do you discover a specific one howdo you test it how do you understand it


0:13:36
Speaker 1 :how do you ship it yeah well I'll give
 an example which goes back to what I said before so when I was doing mypostdoctoral work with Judah Folkman we
 wanted to come up with drugs that would stop blood vessels from growing oralternatively make them grow and
 actually people didn't even believe that that those things could happen but could

0:13:55
Speaker 0 :we pause on that for a sec sure what is
 the blood vessel what does it mean for a blood vessel to grow and shrink and whyis that important sure so a blood vessel


0:14:03
Speaker 1 :is could be an artery or vein or a
 capillary and it it you know provides oxygen itprovides nutrients gets rid of waste so
 you know two different parts of your body if you soso the blood vessels endup being very very important and you
 know if you have cancer blood vessels grow into the tumor and that's part ofwhat enables the tumor to get bigger and
 that's also part of what enables the tumor to metastasize event which meansspread throughout the body and
 ultimately kill somebody so that was part of what we were trying to do weshot what we wanted to see if we could
 find substances that could stop that from happening so first I mean there aremany steps first we had to develop a bio
 essay to study blood vessel growth again there wasn't one that's where we neededpolymer systems because the blood
 vessels grew slowly took months that so after we had the polymer system and wehad the bioassay then I had isolated
 many different molecules initially from cartilage and almost all of them didn'twork but we were fortunate we found one
 it wasn't purified but we found one that did work and that paper that was thispaper I mentioned in science in 1976
 those were really the isolation of some of the very first angiogenesis of bloodvessel inhibitors so there's a lot of


0:15:29
Speaker 0 :words there yeah that's the the first of
 all polymer molecules big big molecules so the water polymerswhat's bio sa the the what is the
 process is trying to isolate this whole thing simplified to where you cancontrol and experiment with it polymers


0:15:48
Speaker 1 :are like plastics or like plastics or
 rubber what were some of the other

0:15:55
Speaker 0 :questions sorry so a polymer some
 plastics and rubber and that means something that has structure and that

0:16:01
Speaker 1 :could be useful for what well in this
 case it would be something that could be useful for delivering a molecule for along time so it could slowly diffuse out
 of that at a controlled rate to where

0:16:14
Speaker 0 :you wanted it to go so then you would
 find the ideas that there would be particular blood vessels that you cantarget say they're connected some
 Auto tumour you could target and over a long period of time to be able to placethe polymer there and it be delivering a
 certain kind of chemical that's correct

0:16:34
Speaker 1 :I think what you said it's good so so
 that it would deliver the the molecule or the chemical that would stop theblood vessels from going over a long
 enough time so that it really could happen so that was sort of the what wecall the bio sa is the way that we would


0:16:49
Speaker 0 :study that so size of what is a by us
 which part is the bio sa all of it in

0:16:54
Speaker 1 :other words the bio SAS is the way you
 study blood vessel growth the blood

0:17:01
Speaker 0 :vessel growth and you can control this
 somehow with is there an understanding what kind of chemicals can control the

0:17:09
Speaker 1 :growth of a blood sure well now there is
 but then when I started there wasn't and that that gets to your original questionso you go through various steps we did
 the first steps we showed that a such molecules existed and then we developedtechniques for studying them and we said
 even isolated fractions you know groups of substances that would would do it butwhat would happen over the next we did
 that in 1976 we published that what would happen over the next twenty eightyears as other people would follow in
 our footsteps I mean we tried to do some stuff too but ultimately to make a newdrug takes billions of dollars so what
 happened was there were different growth factors that people would isolatesometimes using the techniques that we
 developed and then they would figure out using some of those techniques ways tostop those growth factors and ways to
 stop the blood vessels from growing I thought like you say it took 28 years ittook billions of dollars and work by
 many companies like Genentech but in 2004 28 years after we started the firstone of those Avastin got approved by the
 fda and that that be that's become you know one of the top biotech sellingdrugs in history and it's been approved
 for all kinds of cancers and actually for many eye diseases to where you haveabnormal blood vessel growth macula so


0:18:30
Speaker 0 :in general one of the key ways you can
 alleviate so what's the hope in terms of tumorsassociated with cancerous tumors they
 what can you help by being able to control the growth of vessels so if you

0:18:48
Speaker 1 :cut off the blood supply you cut off the
 it's kind of like a war almost right you if you have if the nutrition is going tothe tumor and you and you and you can
 cut it off I mean you starve the tumor and it becomes very small it maydisappear or it's going to be much more
 amenable to other therapies because it is tiny you know like you knowchemotherapy or immunotherapy is gonna
 be have a much easier time against a small tumor than a big one is that an

0:19:16
Speaker 0 :obvious idea I mean it seems like a very
 clever strategy in this war against yeah

0:19:23
Speaker 1 :cancer well you know in retrospect it's
 an obvious idea but when dr. Folkman and my boss first proposed it it wasn't alot of people didn't thought it was


0:19:33
Speaker 0 :pretty crazy and so they in what sense
 if you could sort of linger on it when you're thinking about this ideas at thetime were you feeling you're out in the
 dark so how much mystery is there about the whole thing how much just blindexperimentation if you can put yourself
 in that mindset from years ago yeah well

0:19:53
Speaker 1 :there was I mean for me actually it
 wasn't just the idea was that I didn't know a lot of biology or biochemistry soI've certainly felt a host in the dark
 but I I kept trying and I kept trying to learn and I kept plugging but but I meana lot of it was being in the dark so the


0:20:09
Speaker 0 :human body is complicated right we'll
 establish this quantum mechanics and physics is a theory that worksincredibly well but we don't really
 necessarily understand the underlying nature of itso our drugs the same and that you can
 you're ultimately trying to show that the thing works to do something that youtry to do but you don't necessarily
 understand the fundamental mechanisms by which it's doing it it really varies I

0:20:36
Speaker 1 :think sometimes people do know them
 because they've figured out pathways and wish to interfere them with them othertimes is shooting in the dark is it
 really has varied okay and sometimes people make sure--andJupitus discoveries and they don't even
 realize what they did so what is the

0:20:52
Speaker 0 :discovery process for a drug ze said a
 bunch of people of trying to work with this is it is it a kind of mix ofserendipitous discovery and art or is
 there a systematic science to trying different chemical reactions and howthey how they affect whatever you trying
 to do like shrink blood vessels yeah I

0:21:18
Speaker 1 :don't think there's a single way you
 know single way to go about something in terms of characterizing the entire drugdiscovery process if I look at the blood
 vessel one yeah they're the first step was to do to have that those kinds oftheories that dr. Folkman had the second
 step was to have the techniques where you could study blood vessel growth forthe first time and at least quantitate
 or semi-quantitative a third step was to find substances thatwould stop blood vessels from growing
 for step was to maybe purify those substances there are many other stepstoo I mean before you have an effective
 drug you have to show that it's safe you have to show those effective and youstart with animals you ultimately go to
 patients and there are multiple kinds of clinical trials you have to do if you

0:22:06
Speaker 0 :step back is it amazing to you that we
 descendants of great apes are able to create things there you know are thecreate drugs chemicals that are able to
 improve some aspects of our bodies Hey or is it quite natural that we were ableto discover these kinds of things well


0:22:27
Speaker 1 :at a high level
 it is amazing I mean evolution is amazing yeah you know the way I look atyour question the fact that we evolved
 have evolved the way we've done I mean it's pretty remarkable so let's talk

0:22:37
Speaker 0 :about drug delivery what are the
 difficult problems in drug delivery what is drug delivery you know from startingfrom your early seminal work in the


0:22:50
Speaker 1 :field that today well drug delivery is
 getting a drug to to be good to go where you want it at the level you want it ina safe way
 some of the big challenges I mean there are a lot I mean I'd sayone is could you target the right cell
 like we talked about cancers or some way to deliver a drug just to the cancercell and no other cell another challenge
 is to get drugs across different barriers like could you ever giveinsulin orally could you give a train
 you know or give it passively transdermally can you get drugs acrossthe blood-brain barrier I mean there are
 lots of big challenges can you make smart drug delivery systems that mightrespond to physiologic signals in the


0:23:32
Speaker 0 :body oh it's just think so smart
 smart they have some kind of sense a chemical sensor or is this somethingmore than a chemical sense that it's
 able to respond to something in the body

0:23:43
Speaker 1 :could be either one I mean you know I I
 mean one example might be if you that were diabetic if you had more it gotmore glucose could you get more insulin
 but I don't but that but that's just an

0:23:56
Speaker 0 :example is there some way to control the
 actual mechanism of delivery in a response to what the body's doing yes

0:24:01
Speaker 1 :there is I mean one of the things that
 we've done is encapsulate what are called beta cells those are insulinproducing cells in a way that they're
 safe and protected and then what will happen is glucose will go in and youknow to sell so we'll make insulin and
 so that that's an example

0:24:22
Speaker 0 :so from an AI robotics perspective how
 close are these drug delivery systems to something like a robot or they'retotally wrong to think about them as
 intelligent agents and how much room is there to add that kind of intelligenceinto these delivery systems perhaps in


0:24:41
Speaker 1 :the future yeah I think it depends on
 the particular delivery system you know of course one of the things people areconcerned about is cost and if you add a
 lot of bells and whistles to something it'll cost more but I mean we forexample have made what I'll call
 intelligent microchips that can don't you know where you can send a signal andyou know release drug in response to
 that say no and I think systems like that microchip someday have thepotential to do it you and I were just
 talking about that there could be a signal like glucose and it could havesome instruction to say when there's
 more glucose deliver more insulin

0:25:14
Speaker 0 :so do you think it's possible that there
 that could be robotic type systems roaming our body sort of long-term andbe able to deliver certain kinds of
 drugs in the future you see you see that

0:25:25
Speaker 1 :kind of future someday I don't think
 we're very close to it yet but someday you know that that's nanotechnology andthat would mean even miniaturizing some
 of the things that I just discussed and we're certainly not at that point yetbut someday I expect we will be so some


0:25:39
Speaker 0 :of it is just the shrinking of the
 technology that's a part of it that's

0:25:44
Speaker 1 :

0:25:46
Speaker 0 :one of the things in general what role
 do you see AI sort of there there's a lot of work now with using data to makeintelligent and create systems that make
 intelligent decisions do you see any of that data-driven kind of computingsystems having a role in any part of
 this into the delivery and drugs the the design of drugs and any part of the

0:26:15
Speaker 1 :chain I do I think that AI can be useful
 and a number of parts of the chain I mean one I think if you get a largeamount of information you know say you
 have some chemical data because you've done high throughput screens and let'sout I'll just make this up but let's say
 I have I'm trying to come up with a drug to treat disease X and whatever thatdisease is and I have a test for that
 and hopefully a fast test and let's say I test ten thousand chemical substancesyou know and a couple work most of them
 don't work so I maybe work a little but if I had a few with the right kind ofartificial intelligence maybe you could
 look at the chemical structures and look at what works and see if there's certaincommonalities look at what doesn't work
 and see what commonalities there are and then maybe use that somehow to projectthe next generation of things that you


0:27:08
Speaker 0 :would test as a tangent what are your
 thoughts on our society's relationship with pharmaceutical drugs do we andperhaps I apologize if this is a
 philosophical broader question but do we over rely on them do we properlyprescribed them and what ways the system
 working well what way can improve

0:27:28
Speaker 1 :well I think you know pharmaceutical
 drugs are really important I mean the life expectancy and life quality ofpeople over many many years has
 increased tremendously and I think that's a really good thing I think onething that would also be good as if we
 could extend that more and more to people in the developing world which issomething that our lab has been doing
 with the Gates Foundation or trying to do I saw I think ways in which it couldimprove I mean our if there was some way
 to reduce costs you know that that's certainly an issue people are concernedabout if there was some way to help
 people and in poor countries that would also be a good thing and then of coursewe still need to make better drugs for
 so many diseases I mean cancer diabetes I mean we you know it's hard to see somerare diseases there are many many
 situations where it would be great if we could do better and help more people can

0:28:22
Speaker 0 :we talk about another exciting another
 exciting space which is tissue engineeringwhat is tissue engineering or


0:28:31
Speaker 1 :regenerative medicine you know so that
 tissue engineering regenerative medicine have to do with building an organ ortissue from scratch so you know someday
 maybe we can build the liver you know or make new cartilage and also would enableyou to you know someday create organs on
 a chip which people we and others are trying to do which might lead to betterdrug testing and maybe less testing on
 animals for people organs and I chip it

0:28:58
Speaker 0 :sounds fascinating so what what are the
 various ways to generate tissue and how do so is it you know that one is ofcourse from stem cells is there are
 other methods what are the different

0:29:13
Speaker 1 :possible flavors here yeah well I think
 I mean there's multiple components one is having generally some type ofscaffold that's what Jay Vacanti and I
 started many many years ago and then on that scaffold you might put differentcell types which could be a cartilage
 cell a bone cell could be a stem cell though it might differentiate intodifferent things could be more than one


0:29:35
Speaker 0 :cell and the scaffold
 sorry to interrupt is kind of like a canvas that it's a structure that youcan on which the
 the Susskind girl I think that's a good

0:29:43
Speaker 1 :explanation when you just enough to use
 that the caskets that's good yeah so I think that that's fair youknow when the chip could be such a
 canvas some could be fibers that are made of plastics and that you'd put inthe body someday and we need a chip do


0:29:57
Speaker 0 :you mean electronic chip like


0:29:59
Speaker 1 :necessarily it could be though but it
 doesn't have to be it could just be a structure that's not not in vivo so tospeak that's you know that's outside the
 body so is there a nervousness it's not

0:30:13
Speaker 0 :a bad word says there possibility to
 weave into the scanner as a computational component so if we talkabout electron ships some some ability
 to sense control some aspect of this growth process for the tissue I would

0:30:31
Speaker 1 :say the answer to that is yes I think
 right now people are working mostly on validating these con chips for sayingwell it does work as effectively or
 hopefully as just putting something in the body but I think someday will yousuggest it you certainly would be


0:30:50
Speaker 0 :possible so what kind of tissues can we
 engineer today what would yeah yeah well

0:30:54
Speaker 1 :well so skin has already been made and
 approved by the FDA their advanced clinical trials like what are calledphase three trials that are at complete
 or near completion for making new blood vessels one of my former students LorinNicholson led a lot of that he thought


0:31:13
Speaker 0 :that's amazing this human skin can be
 grown that's already approved through the entire the FDA process so that meanswhat so the one that means you can grow
 that tissue and do various kinds of experiments in terms of in terms ofdrugs and so on but what is that does
 that mean that some kind of healing and treatment of different conditions for on

0:31:40
Speaker 1 :human beings yes I mean they've been
 approved now for how many different groups have made them differentcompanies and different professors but
 they've been approved for burn victims and for patients with diabetic skin

0:31:53
Speaker 0 :ulcers that's amazing
 okay so skin what else well at different

0:31:59
Speaker 1 :stages people are like skin blood
 vessels there's clinical trials going now for helping patients here better forpatients that might be paralyzed for
 patients that have different hai problems I'm you know at differentgroups have worked on just about
 everything new liver and who kidneys I mean there have been all kinds of workdone in this area some of its early but
 but there's certainly a lot of activity

0:32:27
Speaker 0 :what about neural tissue yeah nurten the
 nervous system and even the brain while

0:32:33
Speaker 1 :there have been people out of working on
 that too we've done a little bit with that but there are people who've done alot on neural stem cells and I know Evan
 Schneider who's been one of our collaborators on some of our spinal cordworks done work like that and ever been
 other people as well as their challenges

0:32:47
Speaker 0 :for the when it is part of the human
 bodies there's challenges to getting the the body to accept this new tissuethat's being generated how do you solve


0:32:59
Speaker 1 :that kind of challenge there can be
 problems with it accepting it I think maybe in particular you might meanrejection by the body so there are
 multiple ways that people are trying to deal with that one way is which was whatwe've done and with Dan Anderson one of
 my former postdocs and I mentioned this a little bit before for a paintedpancreas is encapsulating the cell so
 immune immune cells or antibodies can't get in and attack them so that's a wayto protect them
 other strategies could be making the cells not immuno genic which might bedone by different either techniques
 which might mask them or using some gene editing approaches so they're differentways that people are trying to do that
 and of course if you use the patient's own cells or cells from a close relativedoubt might be another way and it
 increases the likelihood that they'll

0:33:51
Speaker 0 :get accepted if you use the patient's


0:33:54
Speaker 1 :own cells yes and then finally there's
 some you know suppressive drugs which you know will suppress the immuneresponse that's right now what's done
 say for a liver transplant the fact that

0:34:04
Speaker 0 :this whole thing works just fascinating
 at least from my outside perspective well we one day beable to regenerate any organ or part of
 the the human body in your view and it's exciting to think about futurepossibilities of tissue engineering is
 do you see some tissues more difficult than others what are the possibilities

0:34:26
Speaker 1 :here yeah Wow of course I'm an optimist
 and I also feel a timeframe if we're talking about some day some day could behundreds of years but I think that yes
 some day I think we will be able to regenerate many things and our differentstrategies that one might use the one
 might use some cells themselves one might use you know some molecules thatmight help regenerate the cells and so I
 think there are different possibilities

0:34:51
Speaker 0 :what do you think that means for
 longevity if we look maybe not someday but 10 20 years out are thepossibilities that tissue engineering
 the possibilities of the research that you're doing does it have a significantimpact on the longevity human life I


0:35:09
Speaker 1 :don't know that we'll see a radical
 increase in longevity but I think that in certain areas we'll see people livebetter lives and maybe so somewhat


0:35:21
Speaker 0 :longer lives with the most beautiful
 scientific idea in biology nearing that you've come across in your years ofresearch I apologize for the romantic no


0:35:32
Speaker 1 :that's an interesting question I
 certainly think what is happening right now with CRISPR is a beautiful idea thatcertainly wasn't wasn't my idea I mean
 but you know I think it's very interesting here what what people havecapitalized on is that there's a
 mechanism by which bacteria are able to destroy viruses and that understandingthat let leads the machinery to to put
 you know to sort of cut and paste genes and and you know fix the cell so that

0:36:06
Speaker 0 :kind of you see a promise for that kind
 of ability to copy and paste I mean everything like we said the human bodyis complicated
 is that Mele difficult to do I think it

0:36:22
Speaker 1 :is exceptionally difficult to do but
 that doesn't mean they won't be done there's a lot of companies and peopletrying to do it and I think in some
 areas it will be done some of the ways that make you might lower the bar arenot you know are just taking look like
 not necessarily doing it directly but you know you could take a cell thatmight be useful but you want to give it
 some cancer-killing capabilities something collect what's called the cartC cell and that might be a different way
 of somehow making a cart C cell and maybe making it better so there might besort of easier things and rather than
 just fixing the whole body so the way a lot of things have moved to in medicineover time is stepwise so I can see
 things that might be easier to do than say fix a brain that would be very hardto do but maybe someday that'll happen
 too so in terms of stepwise that's the

0:37:16
Speaker 0 :interesting notion do you see that if
 you look at medicine or bioengineering do you see that there is these big leapsthat happen every decade or so or some
 distant period or is it a lot of incremental work not I don't mean toreduce its impact by saying it's
 incremental but yeah is there sort of phase shifts in in the science big bigleaps


0:37:48
Speaker 1 :I think there's both you know every so
 often a new technique or new technology comes outI mean genetic engineering was an
 example I mentioned CRISPR you know I think every so often things happen thatyou know make a big difference but still
 there's to try to really make progress make a new drug make a new devicethere's a lot of things I don't know if
 I'd call them incremental but there's a lot a lot of work that needs to be done

0:38:15
Speaker 0 :absolutely so you have over numbers
 could be off but it's a big amount you have over 1100 current or pendingpatents that have been licensed sub
 license to over 300 companies what's your viewwould in your view are the strengths and
 what are the drawbacks of the patenting process well I think for the most part

0:38:37
Speaker 1 :their strengths I think that if you
 didn't have patents especially in medicineyou'd never get the funding that it
 takes to make a new drug or a new device I mean which according to Tufts to makea new drug costs over two billion
 dollars right now and nobody would even come close to giving you that money anyof that money if if it weren't for the
 patent system because and then anybody else could do it that that that thenleads to the negative though you know
 sometimes somebody does up a very successful drug and you certainly wantto try to make it available to everybody
 and and so the patent system allows it allowed it happen in the first place butmaybe it'll impede it after a little bit
 or certainly to some people or some companies you know once it's once it is

0:39:33
Speaker 0 :out there what's the on the point of the
 cost what would you say is the most expensive part of the two billiondollars of making the drug given


0:39:41
Speaker 1 :clinical trials that is by far the most


0:39:45
Speaker 0 :in terms of money or pain or both well


0:39:49
Speaker 1 :money but a pain goes hard to know I
 mean but but usually doing proving things that are that are proving thatsomething new is safe and effective
 in people this is almost always the biggest expense could you linger on that

0:40:01
Speaker 0 :for just a little longer and describe
 what it takes to prove for people that don't know in general what it takes toprove that something is effective on


0:40:13
Speaker 1 :humans well you'd have to take at this
 particular disease but what the process is you start out with so usually youstart out with cells then you'd go to
 animal models usually you have to do a couple of animal models and of coursethe animal models aren't perfect for
 humans and then you have to do three sets of clinical trials at a minimum aphase one trial to show that it's safe
 and small number of patients face to trial to show that it's effective in asmall number of patients and a phase
 three trial to show that a safe and effective in a large number of payand you know that could end up being
 hundreds or thousands of patients and they have to be really carefullycontrolled studies and you know you'd
 have to manufacture the drug you'd have to you know really watch those patientsyou have to be very concerned if you
 know that that it is gonna be safe and and and and you look at see does itdoesn't treat the disease better than
 what the whatever the gold standard was before that if there was assuming therewas one that's a really interesting line


0:41:13
Speaker 0 :show that it's safe first and then that
 it's effective first do no harm

0:41:18
Speaker 1 :

0:41:20
Speaker 0 :first do no harm that's right so how
 again if you can linger it a little bit how does the patenting process work yeah

0:41:29
Speaker 1 :well you you do a certain amount of
 research though that's not necessarily has to be the case but you for ususually it is usually we do a certain
 amount of research and make some findings and you know we had ahypothesis let's say we prove it or we
 make some discovery we need to invent some technique and then we writesomething up what's called a disclosure
 we give it to MIT technology transfer office they then give it to some patentattorneys and they use that and plus
 talking to us and you know work on writing a patent and then you go backand forth with the USPTO that's the
 United States Patent and Trademark Office and you know they may not allowit the first second or third time but
 they will tell you why they don't and you may adjust it and maybe you'lleventually get it and maybe you won't so


0:42:21
Speaker 0 :you've been part of launching 40
 companies together worth again numbers could be outdated but an estimatedtwenty three billion dollars you've
 described your thoughts on a formula for startup success so perhaps you candescribe that formula in general
 describe what does it take to build a successful startup well I I break that

0:42:44
Speaker 1 :down into a couple categories and I'm
 I'm a scientist and certainly from the science standpoint I'll go over that butI actually think that really the most
 important thing is probably the business people then thatwork with and you know they when I look
 back at the companies that have done well it's been because we've had greatbusiness people and when they haven't
 done as well we have it as good business people but from a science standpoint Ithink about that we've made some kind of
 discovery that is almost what I'd call a platform that you could use it fordifferent things and certainly the drug
 delivery system example that I gave earlier z' is a good example of that youcould use it for drug ABCDE and so forth
 and that I'd like to think that we've taken it far enough so that we'vewritten at least one really good paper
 and a top journal hopefully a number that we've reduced it to practice inanimal models that we've filed patents
 maybe I had issued patents that of what I'll call very good and broad claimsthat's sort of the key in a patent and
 then in our case a lot of times when we've done it a lot of times it'ssomebody in the lab like a postdoc or
 graduate student spent a big part of their life doing it and that they wantto work at that company because they
 have this passion that they want to see something they did make a difference inpeople's lives maybe you could mention


0:44:09
Speaker 0 :the business component it's funny to
 hear great side to say that there's value to business folks

0:44:18
Speaker 1 :

0:44:18
Speaker 0 :oh yeah well that always said so what
 what value what business instinct is valuable to make a startup successful acompany successful I think the business


0:44:29
Speaker 1 :aspects are you have to be a good judge
 of people so that you hire the right people you have to be strategic so youfigure out if you do of that platform
 that could be used for all these different things what one are you andknowing that medical research is so
 expensive what thing are you gonna do first second third fourth and fifth Ithink you need to have a good Lex what
 I'll call FDA regulatory clinical trial trial strategy I think you have to beable to raise money
 incredibly so there are a lot of things you have to be a good good with peoplegood manager people so the the money in


0:45:05
Speaker 0 :the people part I get but this the stuff
 before in deciding the ABCD if you have a platformwhich trucks the first and taking
 testing you see nevertheless scientist is not being too always too good at that

0:45:21
Speaker 1 :process well I think there a part of the
 process but I'd say there's probably I'm gonna just make this up but maybe six orseven criteria that you want to use and
 it's not just science I mean the kinds of things that I would think about is isthe market big or small is the art there
 are there good animal models for it so that you could test it and it wouldn'ttake you know fifty years are the
 clinical trials that could be set up ones that you know have clear end pointswhere you can make a judgement and and
 another issue would be competition are there other ways that some companies outthere or doing it another issue would be
 reimbursement you know can I get reimbursed so a lot of things that youhave manufacturing issues you'd want to
 consider is it not so I think there are really a lot of things that go intowhether you do what you do for a second


0:46:18
Speaker 0 :third or fourth so you lead one of the
 largest academic labs in the world with over ten million dollars in annualgrants and over 100 researchers probably
 over a thousand since the labs beginning researchers can be individualistic andeccentric I don't put it nicely
 there you go eccentric so what insights into research leadership can you givehaving to run such a successful lab was
 so much diverse talent well I don't know

0:46:48
Speaker 1 :that I'm any expert I think that what
 you do to me I mean I just want that missus gonna sound very simplistic but Ijust want people in the lab to be happy
 to be doing things that I hope will make the world a better place to be workingon science that can make the world a
 better place and I guess my feeling is if we're able to do that you know Peterit kind of runs itself so how do you


0:47:14
Speaker 0 :make a researcher happy in general what


0:47:17
Speaker 1 :I think when people feel I mean this is
 going to sound like again simplistic or maybe like motherhood and apple pie butI think if people feel they're working
 on something really important that can affect many other people's lives andthey're making some progress they'll
 feel good about it they'll feel good about themselves and they'll be happy

0:47:37
Speaker 0 :but through brainstorming and so on
 what's your role and how difficult it is as a group in this in this collaborationto arrive at these big questions that
 might have impact well the big questions

0:47:51
Speaker 1 :come from many different ways sometimes
 it's trying to things that I might think of or somebody in the lab might think ofwhich could be a new technique or to
 understand something better but gee we've had people like Bill Gates and theGates Foundation come to us and Juvenile
 Diabetes Foundation come to us and say gee could you help us on these thingsand I mean that's good too it doesn't
 happen just one way and I mean you've

0:48:16
Speaker 0 :kind of mentioned it happiness but is
 there something more how do you inspire a researcher to do the best work oftheir life so you mentioned passion and
 passion is a kind of fire do you see yourself having a role to keep that firegoing to to build it up to inspire the
 researchers through the you know pretty difficult process of going from idea totoo big question to big answer I think


0:48:49
Speaker 1 :so I think I try to do that by talking
 to people going over their ideas and their progress I try to do it as anindividual you know certainly when I
 talk about my own career I had my setbacks s you know different times andpeople know that that know me and you
 know you just try to keep pushing and and so forth but but yeah I think I tryto do that as the one who leads the lab
 so you have this exceptionally

0:49:21
Speaker 0 :successful lab and and one of the great
 institutions in the world MIT what and yet sort of at least in my neck of thewoods in computer science and artificial
 intelligence a lot of the research is kind of a lot of the greatresearchers not everyone but some are
 kind of going to industry a lot of them researchers moving to industry deep whatdo you think about the future of science
 in general is there drawbacks is a strength to the academic environmentthat you hope will persist how does it
 need to change what needs to stay the samewhat are your just thoughts in this
 whole landscape of science in its future

0:50:07
Speaker 1 :well first I think going to industry is
 good but I think being an academia is good you know I have lots of studentswho have done both and they've had great
 careers doing both I I think from an academic standpoint I mean the biggestconcern probably that people feel today
 you know at a place like MIT or other research heavy institutions is going tobe funding and particularly funding
 that's not super directed you know so that you can do basic research I thinkthat's probably the number one thing but
 you know it would be great if we as a society had come up with better ways toteach you know so that people all over
 could learn better you know so I think there were a number of things that wouldbe good to be able to do better so again


0:50:54
Speaker 0 :you're very successful in terms of
 funding but do you still feel the pressure of that of having to seekfunding does it affect the science or is
 it or can you simply focus on doing the best work of your life and the fundingcomes along with that I'd say the last


0:51:13
Speaker 1 :10 or 15 years we've done pretty well
 funding but I always worry about it you know it's like you're still operating onmore soft money than hard and and so I
 always worry about it but we've been fortunate that places have come to uslike the Gates Foundation and others
 jovan Diabetes Foundation some companies and they're willing to give us fundingand we've gotten government money as
 well we have a number of NIH grants and I've always had that and that'simportant to me too so so I worry about
 it but you know I just view that as a part ofthe process now if you put yourself in


0:51:53
Speaker 0 :the shoes of a philanthropist it like
 say I gave you a hundred billion dollars right now but you couldn't spend on yourown research mm-hmm
 so how how hard is it to decide which labs to invest in which ideas whichproblems which solutions you know cuz
 funding is so much such an important part of progression of science intoday's society if you put yourself in
 the position of philanthropist how hard is that problem how would you go about

0:52:29
Speaker 1 :solving it sure well I think what I do
 for the first thing is different philanthropists have different visionsand I think the first thing is to form a
 concrete vision of what you want some people I mean I'll give just give youtwo examples of people that I know David
 Koch was very interested in cancer research and part of that was that hehad cancer and prostate cancer and a
 number of people are do that along those lines they've had somebody they'veeither had cancer themselves or somebody
 they loved had cancer and they want to put money into cancer research billgates on the other hand I think when he
 had got his fortune I mean he thought about it and felt well how could he havethe greatest impact and he thought about
 you know helping people in the developing world and and and andmedicines and different things like that
 that like vaccines that might be really helpful for people in the developingworld and and so so I think first you
 start out with that vision once you start out with that vision whatevervision it is then I think you try to ask
 the question who in the world does the best work if that was your goal I meanbut you really I think have to have a
 defined vision vision first yeah that that comes and and and I think that'swhat people do I mean I have never seen
 anybody do it otherwise I mean and and that by the way it may not be the bestthing overall I mean I think I think
 it's good that all those things happen but you know what you really want to doand I'll make a contrast in a second in
 addition to funding important areas like what both of those peopleis to help young people and that they
 may be at odds with each other because a farm or a lab like ours which is youknow I'm older is you know might be very
 good at addressing some of those kinds of problems but you know I'm not young Itrained a lot of people who are young
 but it's not the same as helping somebody who's an assistant professorsomeplace so I think what's I think been
 good about our thing our society or things overall or that there are peoplewho come at it from different ways and
 the combination the confluence of the government funding the certainfoundations that that fund things and
 other foundations that you don't want to see disease treated well then they cango seek out people or they can put a
 request for proposals and see who does the best you know I'd say both DavidKoch and Bill Gates did exactly that
 they sought out people most of them you know or what are their foundations thatthey were involved in so I doubt people
 like myself but they also had requests for proposals

0:55:11
Speaker 0 :now you mentioned young people and that
 reminds me something he said in an interview of written somewhere that saidyou're some of your initial struggles in
 that terms of finding a faculty position or so on they eat in quite for peoplefit into a particular bucket a


0:55:33
Speaker 1 :

0:55:34
Speaker 0 :particular right can you speak to that
 how do you see limitations to the academic system that it does have suchbuckets there's is there how can we
 allow for people who are brilliant but outside the disciplines of the previousdecade yeah well I think that's a great


0:55:59
Speaker 1 :question I think that I think the
 department has have to have a vision you know and some of them do every so oftenyou know there are Institute's or labs
 that do that I mean at MIT I think that's done sometimes I knowannika engineering department just had a
 search and they hired geo Traverso who was one of my he was a fellow with meand but he's he's actually a molecular
 biologist Anna and and a gastroenterologist and you know he's oneof the best in the world but they but
 he's also done some great mechanical engineering and designing some new pillsand things like that and they picked a
 man boy I give them a lot of credit I mean that's that's that's vision to picksomebody and I think you know they'll be
 the richer for I think the Media Lab is certainly hired you know people I getBoyden and others who depth on you know
 very different things and so I think that you know is that that that's partof the vision of the leadership who who
 do things like that do you think one day

0:57:03
Speaker 0 :you mentioned David Koch and cancer do
 you think one day will cure cancer yeah

0:57:10
Speaker 1 :I do I mean I coached one day I don't
 know how long that they will come soon but yeah so soon no but I mean I thinkdo you think it is a grand challenge it


0:57:18
Speaker 0 :is a grand challenges it's not just
 solvable within a few years not so I

0:57:22
Speaker 1 :don't think very many things are
 solvable in a few years there's some good ideas that people are working onbut I mean all cancers that's that's
 pretty tough if we do get the cure what

0:57:32
Speaker 0 :will the Cure look like do you think
 which mechanisms which disciplines will help us arrive at that cure from all theamazing work you've done as touched on


0:57:43
Speaker 1 :cancer no I think it'll be a combination
 of biology and engineering I think it'll be biology to understand the rightgenetic mechanisms to to solve this
 problem and maybe the right immunological mechanisms and engineeringin the sense of you know producing the
 molecules developing the right delivery systems targeting it or whatever elseneeds to be done well that's a beautiful


0:58:05
Speaker 0 :vision for engineering so on a lighter
 topic I've read that you love chocolate and mention two places venom Bill'schocolate thorium and the chocolate
 cookies the the Soho globs from Rosie's bakery Chestnut Hill I went to theirwebsite and I was trying to finish the
 paper last night there's a deadline today and yet house wasting way too muchtime at three
 instead of writing the paper staring at the rosey breakers cookies which or justlook incredible the so whole globs just
 look incredible but for me oatmeal white raisin cookiesit's not one my heart just from the
 pictures do you think one day we'll be able to engineer the perfect cookie withthe help of chemistry and maybe a bit of
 data-driven artificial intelligence or is cookies something that's more artthan engineering I think there's some of


0:59:02
Speaker 1 :both I think I think engineer will
 probably help someday and what about

0:59:07
Speaker 0 :

0:59:08
Speaker 1 :chocolate same thing same thing you have
 to go to see some of David Edwards stuff you know he he was one of my postdocsand he's a professor at Harvard but he
 also started cafe arts sciences and you know it's just a really cool restauranthere but he also has companies that do
 you know ways of looking at fragrances and and trying to use engineering and innew ways and so I think that's just an
 example but I expect someday that AI and engineering will play a role and almosteverything including creating the


0:59:40
Speaker 0 :perfect cookie yes well I dream of that
 day as well so when you look back at your life having accomplished anincredible amount of positive impact on
 the world through science and engineering what are you most proud of

0:59:56
Speaker 1 :my students you know I mean I really
 feel when I look at that I mean we've probably had you know close to athousand students go through the lab and
 I mean they've done incredibly well I think 18 are in the National Academy ofEngineering 16 and the National Academy
 of Medicine I mean they're you know they've been CEOs of companiespresidents of universities I mean and
 Dave I mean they've done I think eight orfaculty MIT maybe about 12 at Harvard I
 mean so you know it really makes you feel good to think that the people youknow they're not my children but they're
 close to my children and in a way and you know makes you feel really good tosee them have such great lives and them
 do so much good and be happy well I

1:00:38
Speaker 0 :think that's the perfect way to end it
