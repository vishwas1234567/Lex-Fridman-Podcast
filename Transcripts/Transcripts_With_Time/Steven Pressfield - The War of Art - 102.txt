0:04:57
Speaker 1 :Pressfield
 modern society many ways dreams of creating universal peace and yet war hasmolded civilization as we know it
 throughout his history so let's start at the high philosophically ville if youcould imagine a world without war
 how would that world be different perhaps put another way well purpose haswar served why do we fight


0:05:26
Speaker 0 :I think we're basically the same
 creatures internally that we were in the cave right in tribal society back forhowever many you know hundreds of
 thousands millions of years which means that we're in our the dynamic in ourmind is that kind of an us-versus-them
 dynamic where our tribe is the people and everybody else are whatever you knowand I don't see that I don't think
 that's changed one iota over the over the centuries it's just a question ofhow how one might sublimate that that
 urge to compete you're a martial artist you know that you know a great part ofyour day I'm sure is dedicated to
 reaching that place of you know of total commitments and in the face ofcompetition in the face of adversity at
 cetera et cetera which is I think natural and great for the human race onan individual basis so the the hope that
 I have if there is any hope personally I don't think the human race is gonna bearound very long but would be in in
 sports or in other kind of sublimated activities where people can act outtheir need for conquest or aggression or
 so forth but at the same time relate to their opponents as human beings thatwhen the game is over
 you know you embrace your competitors

0:07:01
Speaker 1 :stuff like that so you think war was
 inevitable it's a it's a part of human nature as opposed to a force a creativeforce in society that


0:07:13
Speaker 0 :serve the benefit well I'm sure it has
 benefited you know spreading cultures and mixing cultures and stuff like thatbut I think the the urge to conquest if
 you think about Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar Napoleon or anybody likethat or any even individual or if we
 even think about one of the plants that we're looking at right outside I mean ifyou let a particular plant have its way
 it would take over reading on the whole hillside and certainly in the days ofAlexander the Great let's say there were
 who knows over looking over the face of the earth hundreds of little kingdomsChina Japan
 you know Asia Europe wherever and every prince that grew up dreamt of conqueringhis neighbor and conquering a neighbor
 after that that seems to be a universal human imperative at least in the male of

0:08:13
Speaker 1 :the species so where is this the
 realization of that imperative I think

0:08:16
Speaker 0 :

0:08:17
Speaker 1 :so so you've written about Spartans in
 the Battle of Thermopylae about Alexander the Great about the six-daywar in 67 in Israel against Egypt Jordan
 Syria what war not just out of those but in general do you think has been mosttransformative for the world well he's a


0:08:38
Speaker 0 :great questions Lex ah easy ones right I
 mean I wish I knew more about the Mongols because I certainly from whatI've what little I know I think that was
 a very their conquests was a very transformative bringing cultures youknow you know horrible bloody way
 together but gosh what's then the most transformative maybe the Roman conquestyou know establishing the Roman Empire
 and bringing that culture maybe Alexander the Great's Wars that you knowUnited East and West at least for a


0:09:19
Speaker 1 :minute it's a building of empire do you
 have a sense so there's Wars I mean the six-day waris not about building empires
 it's about deep how deeply held religious cultural conflict and holdingthe line holding the border and then
 there is conquests like the Mongols that what is it some large percentage of thepopulation is a descendant of Genghis
 Khan believed right so that has transformative effects in that in WorldWar two I mean personally and my family
 and so on the transformative effects let

0:09:59
Speaker 0 :me ask you this Lex why are you what are
 you trying to get at with these questions what is this kind of the themethat you're you're aiming here well I


0:10:09
Speaker 1 :talked to Eric Weiss that and he said
 everything is great about war except the killing and there's a romantic notion ofwar certainly this romantic notion of
 being a warrior but there's a romantic notion of war that somehow there's acreative force to it that because we
 fight out of that fighting comes culture comes music and art and more and moredesire to create with the societies that
 win and to me war is not just hey I have a stick and I want your land it's somekind of it like it has echoes of the the
 creative force that makes humans unique to other animals like Wars you you itcan't be just four people or 10 people
 or 100 people you have to have thousands of people agreeing usually thousands ormore for something so deeply that you
 would be willing to risk your own life and there's a romantic notion to thatand because you've written so well and
 passionate about some of these I wanted to seebecause I don't have any answers I
 wanted to untangle that if there is a reason we fight that's more than just

0:11:37
Speaker 0 :

0:11:38
Speaker 1 :anger and hate and wanting to conquer


0:11:43
Speaker 0 :well let me take it from a completely
 different side I don't think that I in writing about war am really thatinterested in war per se I'm more
 interested in the metaphor I think for me I'm really writing about my owninternal war and and the war against
 myself and against my own resistance my own negativity all of those things thatare that spirituality would would be the
 opposite of so so I'm not really an expert on war it's not like talking toJim mattis or to you know Victor Davis
 Hanson or whatever to me the human being we are spiritual beings in a physicalenvelope and there's a automatic
 terrible tension within that and and which creates a war inside ourselves sothe outer the outer war when I when I
 think about the Israeli army standing up to you know whatever 10 to 1 odds orwhatever it was that is a metaphor to me
 of the fight we were fighting inside ourselves it for me the six-day war wasas you know my feeling was it was about
 a return from exile it was sort of the culmination of the reestablishment ofthe State of Israel which had never
 really been completed because the holiest places of the Jewish people werein the hands of their enemies so now on
 the other hand Alexander the Great's conquests I think were a whole otherdifferent scenario where the metaphor
 was that Alexander's father Philip I think created the first nation capitaland nation
 and he created a sort of a pathway for these guys who were mountain men andbasically barbarians Macedonians and
 Crete by creating this army and this dream of conquering the world whichAlexander took to the you know really
 enacted he gave them a way of rising out of themselves of transcending themselvesnot just individually but as a people so
 that would go along with what you're saying Lex of a certain creativity to itbut but again that's not for whatever
 I'm just realizing this as I'm answering this that's not really what'sinteresting to me about these stories
 and the Spartans to what was a hole at Thermopylae that was a whole other kindof metaphor of war that was a sort of a
 willingly going to one's own death for a greater cause just like to me theSpartans at Thermopylae enacted as a
 group what Jesus Christ enacted as an individual a sacrifice of their livesfor the greater for the greater good I
 don't know if that answers your question but that's how I that's how I see it Ido feel like you know I get invited to
 speak to Marine Corps groups and things like that all the time and I declinebecause I don't really feel like I'm a
 spokesman for the warrior class or anything like that it's not that's notwhat's interesting about it to me but


0:15:24
Speaker 1 :didn't you just say with Wars a metaphor
 that we're all essentially in various

0:15:32
Speaker 0 :ways warriors if we think of it in terms
 of Union archetypes and think of our life as at least as some as males andthe earliest archetypes that kick in are
 the youth and the wanderer and the student and that kind of thing and thenat some point around age 15 to 20
 whatever the warrior archetype kicks in and we want to play football I want todo martial arts we want to join the
 Special Forces we want to hang out with our buddies that's our great bond wewant to test ourselves against adversity
 and so on and so forth but at some point that archetype we move beyond thatarchetype and we become fathers and and
 teachers and so on and so forth and then there are many archetypes beyond thattowards the end so I'm I'm interested in
 the warrior archetype but not to the be-all and end-all of everything elseyou know there's a in in my book the
 virtues of war I have you read that there's a character named telamon who'sactually it's a long story but when he's
 with Alexander's army and when they arrive in India he becomes fascinated bythe gymnast fists the [ __ ] the naked
 wise men the the Yogi's and he says to Alexander that these guys are ourwarriors beyond what we are even though
 they do nothing because they are inside their own selves you know all day long

0:17:11
Speaker 1 :if we if we go to the Six Day War you
 write about in Lionsgate you write about the six-day war in Israel I think of thewars you've written about it's the one
 we're still in many ways in the midst of today yes so what is it the core of thatconflict and


0:17:35
Speaker 0 :the israeli-palestinian conflict I mean


0:17:37
Speaker 1 :today it's the israeli-palestinian
 conflict but it's uh echoes of the same conflict in that part of the world withIsrael what is in your sense the nature
 of that conflict what can we learn about society and human nature from thatconflict that is one of the hottest
 conflicts that still goes on today well

0:18:01
Speaker 0 :when I was working on the Lionsgate
 about the six-day war I wrote in the in the introduction that this was not goingto be a multi-sided story I was taking
 it entirely I'm a Jew I identify with the Israeli people I was gonna see itentirely from their side so that's
 probably not what you're asking but to me the six-day war and that whole youknow it's it's a piece of land that's
 holy to at least three religions and probably more and from the Jewish pointof view it's where the State of Israel
 it's where David founded Jerusalem it's all whether twelve tribes were etc.etcMoses came and brought the people so to
 to me the the the six-day war was about as I said a return from exile fromdiaspora after 2,000 years now obviously
 from the Palestinian point of view or the Saudi Arabian point of view orwhatever as it's a whole other scenario


0:19:11
Speaker 1 :the religion is at the core of this
 conflict in some ways the religious

0:19:15
Speaker 0 :beliefs religion and racial / ethnic
 tribal identity I mean what is a Jew is a Jew somebody that believes in thereligion or is it somebody of a certain
 race that who that race arose in a certain place same thing as a Muslimwhat is a Muslim and they believe in you
 know Muhammad or whatever or did they arise in a certain place and a certainethnicity because if we landed from Mars
 we couldn't tell a Jew from a Palestinian could we you know justlooking at them you could easily mix
 them and you'd never know and the the

0:19:49
Speaker 1 :specifics of the faith is not
 necessarily the thing that defines no person I don't think so the be like manyare secular Jew living in Israel and
 still have a strong bond only definitely

0:20:03
Speaker 0 :in fact almost all of the Jews the
 fighters that I spoke to from the six-day war were secular and it reallywas not you know a religious thing with
 them as much as it was a national thing

0:20:21
Speaker 1 :so having spent time in Israel how's the
 world where military conflict is directly felt as opposed to maybe if welook at the US was distant and far away
 how is that world different how are the

0:20:37
Speaker 0 :people different it's very different as


0:20:39
Speaker 1 :you know yeah I've never been to Israel
 actually we haven't even felt it ah well

0:20:43
Speaker 0 :you should definitely go I mean here in
 the United States where when like there's an incident like Charlottesvillecomes up you know where people are
 chanting Jews will not replace us blah blah blah the impulse and the Jewishcommunity is to think about how can we
 reach out to the other side you know how can how can we show them that we arehuman beings like they are and show them
 that we care for them at cetera et cetera that's the sort of distant fromwar from if you're in Israel and you
 know like if you and I were we're Israeli citizens right now you would bea fighter pilot or a tank commander or
 whatever you know you would not just be as you know working at MIT or whateverand I would be in the Army too and so
 from their point of view they say all those people who hate us can I curse onthis court this thing that [ __ ] them
 will kill them kill you know if they dare to cross the line and that'sthey're a whole different point of view
 to me it's actually a healthier point of view you think so

0:21:53
Speaker 1 :yeah there's no so let me ask the hard
 question is well maybe it's an impossible questionshow do we resolve that conflict in


0:22:02
Speaker 0 :Israel and in Israel or anywhere


0:22:04
Speaker 1 :anywhere where the instinct is to reach
 out in us and say a few and in the

0:22:13
Speaker 0 :people yeah here's my here's I think
 that the only way that two warring sides or two sides that are opposed to oneanother can ever really come together is
 when there's mutual respect we get to some more waterwhen there's mutual respect and and and
 as and they can see each other as equals and theirs and when there's mutual fearyou know where where one side says we
 don't dare cross a line with this other side and the other side says the samething I think then you can kind of reach
 across that thing and say okay they will stay here you stay here we'll we'llmingle in cultural ways in will have
 interchange you know winter marriage dah dah dah but as soon as one side has nopower as the Jewish people have had no
 power throughout the Diaspora forever right then it's just a human nature youcan see it in Trump and what he does to
 any vulnerable minority right um it's it's and he's not alone I'm not blamingchemo alone that's human nature so I do
 think that that idea of like [ __ ] you if you cross the line will kill you it'sreally a good way is it's a good place
 to start from because now you can sit down on opposite sides of the table andsay you know what do we have in common
 how can we we want to raise our children you want to raise your children how canwe do this in a way that's that we're
 not hurting each other so you kind of

0:23:41
Speaker 1 :said that he to arrive at a ballot some
 kind of balance of power yet you haven't spoken to the fact that there is deeplyrooted hatred
 of the other so is there no way to alleviate that hatred or is that I meanwhat what role does love but hatred can


0:24:02
Speaker 0 :go away I really do I mean if you look
 at even even now that I haven't seen this in person but they say that theSaudis and the Israelis are
 collaborating on certain things you know by their mutual fear of or antagonism toIran I do think that even really long
 long long standing hatreds and animosities thousands of years old cancan go away under the right


0:24:30
Speaker 1 :circumstances in uh on what timescale I


0:24:33
Speaker 0 :mean that for instance I don't know that


0:24:36
Speaker 1 :somebody thinking people have to die do
 generations have to die and pass away and new generations come up with lesshate or can a single individual learn to


0:24:47
Speaker 0 :not hate I think a single individual can
 learn to not hate because it certainly doesn't seem to over thousands of yearsdoesn't seem to work you know we keep
 thinking that that's going to happen but I think it's we're in a real spiritualrealm here when you're talking about
 that you're in a realm of you know Buddha Jesus whatever something likethat that we're a you know a a true
 change of soul it happens but I do think

0:25:16
Speaker 1 :that's possible so what do you think is
 the future of warfare especially with what many people see is the expansion ofthe military industrial conflict to what
 do you I know you're not a military historianI'm asking more as a metaphor uh-huh and
 we'll do you see us as people continuing

0:25:40
Speaker 0 :to fight you know it's a really great
 question likes because because I think now with social media TV movies all ofthese things that create empathy across
 cultures it becomes harder and harder I think I think to totally demonize theother the way it was in previous Wars I
 also think I don't really see an appetite for people wanting to go to warthese days I and in a way I don't know
 if that's good or bad it's like everybody's so fat and lazy and soconcerned with how many clicks they're
 getting that you know whereas I know at the start of World War one that both theyounger generations were eager to go to
 war you know I think it was it was it was insane but it was that sort ofwarrior archetype that we were talking
 about before that that generational testosterone arrows thing wears nowadaysI don't know I mean it's hard to say
 there's not gonna be another war because there always are but it's sort of hardto imagine people getting off their ass
 these days to do anything well it's

0:26:58
Speaker 1 :funny that you mention social media as
 the place for empathy sure but it's in a sense that's the place for for war ordeath from hatred and and perhaps the
 positive aspects of hatred on social media is that it's somewhat less harmfulthan murder
 and so it kind of dissipates sort of the hate folds you get the hate out at yeahand uh you know it'll s yeah on a daily
 basis and thereby never boils up to a

0:27:38
Speaker 0 :point where you want to kill it's also a
 really weird thing that's going on I don't know if anybody really understandslike with videogames where kids are
 acting out these incredible horror things right but you know that if theycut their finger they would like freak
 out I know and and I also don't think that many of the people that are hatefulon social media if they were face to
 face with the horse and they wouldn't so there's a sort of a to to mental sphereshappening at the same time and I don't


0:28:14
Speaker 1 :know how that maps that out military how
 that actually Maps the military yeah yeah it's like when you uni UnitedStates have a draft for example what how
 the populace will respond different than they did in previous generation yeah I

0:28:29
Speaker 0 :think they certainly would yeah


0:28:31
Speaker 1 :another question not sure if you thought
 about it but I work on building artificial intelligence systems in ourcommunity many people worried about AI
 being used in war so automating the killing process the with with withdrones and in general is being used more


0:28:48
Speaker 0 :and more
 I should recuse myself on that when I really haven't thought about haven'tthought about it I'd rather ask you are
 you thinking

0:28:54
Speaker 1 :well it's interesting I mean because
 it's so fundamentally different from if you look at the Battle of Thermopylae itmeans just if we talk about the
 different scene a gun and a sword I'll

0:29:06
Speaker 0 :tell you one Atlanta coat
 there was a Spartan King I don't know which one it was but at one point theyshowed him a new invention and it could
 launch a bolt that would you know kill someone at a range of 200 yards and theking wept and said alas valor is no more
 was there a point of view of war it was highly ritualized as you know and thethe the code of honor was that you were
 not supposed to be able to kill another person unless you yourself were an equaldanger of being killed and any other way
 of doing that even bow and arrow was considered less than manly and less thanhonorable and maybe we should go back to
 that because at least it makes the

0:29:58
Speaker 1 :stakes real and true and not that we


0:29:59
Speaker 0 :

0:30:00
Speaker 1 :could not not that's the point you were


0:30:07
Speaker 0 :in the Marine Corps so if we talk about


0:30:09
Speaker 1 :the real the bloody conflicts you've
 written about many of them so let me ask a personal questionhave you sort of as writing and in
 general have you thought about what it takes to kill a person if you yourself

0:30:32
Speaker 0 :could do it yeah well not about it yeah


0:30:33
Speaker 1 :and how that would make you feel of


0:30:36
Speaker 0 :course
 one never knows I certainly I have not been in combat I haven't killed anybodybut I would imagine in the real world
 that it would change you utterly forever because you can't help but identify witha person that you've just killed and
 it's another human being and I mean I have a hard time killing a spider so Iwould imagine that it's something that
 warriors understand and nobody else

0:31:14
Speaker 1 :understands and he's spoken with many
 how I mean you've spoken with people who seem military combat oh yeah in Israelwhat have they been able to articulate
 the the experience of killing it's this

0:31:28
Speaker 0 :sort of just what I said I mean I'm even
 thinking of one pilot that I interviewed over there who you know was strafing atank in his Mustang and saw and at
 really low altitude and you know saw what his bullets did to the guy andcould see his face and everything like
 that which is even you know one remove or more removes from an infantryman whenan infantryman does and he said that
 that same thing that I said that it just changes you and you can never say itthey never look at the world or look at
 anything the same way again and when

0:32:08
Speaker 1 :that happened that scale the thousands
 the thousands of hundred yeah that changes entire societies that's what

0:32:16
Speaker 0 :we've seen well at least it but the
 problem is it doesn't change the politicians back home right

0:32:20
Speaker 1 :how important is mortality
 finiteness the the fact that this thing ends to the creative process so killingin war really emphasizes that but in
 general the fact that this thing ends

0:32:42
Speaker 0 :gee it does it does [ __ ] and I was


0:32:49
Speaker 1 :serious no do you think about your own
 mortality do you meditate on your own mortality when you think about the work

0:32:56
Speaker 0 :you do other great question Lex actually
 I'm 75 and I just was having I had breakfast in New York a few months agowith a friend of mine who spiked my
 exact same age and I said to him I said Nick do you ever think about mortalityand he said every [ __ ] minute every
 day and I was kind of relieved to hear that because I do I do toobut I actually I always have I think and
 I think you know the fact of mortality is kind of gives meaning to life youknow I think that's why we want to
 create that's why we want to make a mark of some kind or and the other aspect ofit is what's on the other side of that
 mortality I'm a believer in previous lives so I I sort of and I the questionI've never been able to answer among
 many many others just like why are we even here right why are we in the fleshyou know I sort of I like to believe
 that God or some force is we're on some kind of journey but I'm not sure why whywe were put in this world where the
 ground rules are if you think about animal life that you cannot live fromone day to the next without killing and
 eating some other form of life and what a demented thing yeah you know whycouldn't we just have a solar panel on
 our head and you know be friends with everybody so I sort of I don't get whatthat was all about but that's


0:34:41
Speaker 1 :sort of the big issue I have you read
 the earners Becker's denial of death for example is that Ernest Becker is aphilosopher that said that the death
 that the fear of death is really the primary driver of everything we do soFreud had what the right I would agree
 with that so did you you've always thought aboutyour even your own mortality yes


0:35:06
Speaker 0 :

0:35:06
Speaker 1 :definitely and can you elaborate on the
 the reincarnation aspect what you were talking about like that we kind ofwhat's your sense that we had previous


0:35:19
Speaker 0 :

0:35:20
Speaker 1 :lies in what have you thought concretely
 or is it a lot of it kind of as no I

0:35:24
Speaker 0 :thought can concretely about really I
 mean it's very clear when you see children young kids or even dogs andcats that they come into the world with
 personalities you know and three kids and a family are going to becomecompletely different and completely
 their own person and and and that person that they are doesn't change over lifeand I you know there's one of the things
 that I did in my book the artist journey is that there were certain things whereI tracked or just listed in order like
 all of Bruce Springsteen's albums or all of Philip Roth's books you know kind ofa body of work throughout over you know
 a period of 30 40 50 years you know and you can see that there's a theme runningthrough all of those things that it's
 completely unique to that person nobody else could have written Philip Roth'sbooks or Bruce Springsteen songs and you
 can even see sort of a destiny there so I asked myself well where did that comefrom what it's it seems to be a
 continuation of something that was that happened before and that will lead tosomething else because it's not starting
 from scratch it seems like there's a a calling a destiny in there alreadythis gets back to the Meuse and all that


0:36:55
Speaker 1 :kind of thing so yeah it's almost like
 the there's this let's call it a God it's passing it's almost like samplingparts of a previous human that has lived
 and putting that those into the new one

0:37:10
Speaker 0 :sampling this is probably a pretty good


0:37:13
Speaker 1 :work that taking some of the good boy
 you can't take all the good parts because the bad parts is what makes theperson right let's say taking all
 together okay this is humans only does it pass aroundfrom animals in your view is they I


0:37:25
Speaker 0 :don't know that's above my pay grade I


0:37:28
Speaker 1 :don't know so okay see you talk about
 the muse as the source of ideas maybe since you've gotten a few glimpses ofher in your writing tell me let me what
 is it possible for you to tell me about about herwhere does she reside what does she look


0:37:54
Speaker 0 :like I mean you can look at in many
 different ways right the Greeks did it in an anthropomorphic way right theycreated gods or like human beings but if
 you look at it from a Kabbalistic Jewish perspective Jewish mysticism you couldsay that it's the solo neshama right
 that the soul is above us on a higher plane our own your soul my soul and it'strying to reach down to us and and
 communicate with us and we're trying simultaneously to reach up to it to itthrough prayer or through if you're a
 writer or an artist you know when you sit down at the keyboard you're enteringinto a kind of prayer you're entering
 into a different state of an altered consciousness to some extent you'reopening yourself opening the pipeline or
 turning on the radio to tune into the cosmic radio station and another way oflooking at it this is Anna do you ever
 see the movie City of Angels the visual of the movie it was meg Ryan and Owen

0:38:58
Speaker 1 :the game yeah I've seen a hip and right


0:39:00
Speaker 0 :the visual of the movies
 was meg Ryan is a heart surgeon and as she's operating on somebody suddenlyNicolas Cage in this long duster coat
 like Jesse James appears right next to her in the operating woman he's an angeland he's waiting to take out the soul of
 the Prairie patient on the on the operating table and she doesn't see himshe's totally unaware of him and so is
 everybody else in the operating room except maybe the guy who's about to dieI suddenly sees him but I kind of
 believe that that there are beings like that or if you don't like that it's aforce it's a consciousness it's
 something that are right here right now and we and they're trying to communicateto us and like through a membrane like
 tapping on that window over there they're like right out there and theycarry the future they are everything
 that is in potential all the works that you will do Lex your startup whateverelse you're doing they they know that
 and it's not really you that's coming up with those ideas in my opinion thosethings are appearing you know it's like
 somebody knocks on the door yeah and puts it in I mean in the Iliad wheregods and goddesses appear along with the
 human antagonists on the battlefield all the time right they'll be you know Homerflashes to Olympus and then back to the
 real world and there's the thing where one Aphrodite let's say wants to helpParis and so she says well I will appear
 to him in a dream and I'll take the form of his brother and I'll say bumpetybumpety bump so that's creatures beings
 on one dimension as the Greek sought communicating with and I believe thatthat's exactly what's going on in one
 whatever analogy you want to use that

0:41:12
Speaker 1 :that communication to which degree
 is do you play the role in that communication as opposed to sitting atthe computer if you're a writer and
 staring at the blank page and putting in the time and waiting what so if in yourin your view it is are these creatures
 basically waiting to tell you about your future or is their choice how manypossible futures are there how many
 possible ideas are that's a great

0:41:48
Speaker 0 :question I think there's basically yes
 they're all alternatives you know degrees within it but IFIF youlook at Bruce Springsteen's albums how
 much could he have done really differently yeah he would you can justsee there's a whole impetus we're going
 through the whole thing and nothing was gonna shake him off that you know andyeah maybe the river could have been
 different it could have been called something else but but he was dealingwith certain issues his conscious self
 was dealing with certain issues that were really out of his control he was hewas drawn he was called to it right
 nothing could stop him and so it is sort of a partnership but I think thecreative process between the creative
 impulse that's coming from some other place or it's coming from deep within usis another way to look at it you know
 it's a like if we are acorns and and we're growing then to Oaks so theconscious bird artist who's sitting
 there at the keyboard or whatever is applying his or her consciousness tothat but is also going into opening
 themselves to the unconscious or to this other realm whatever whatever that is Imean certainly songwriters for a million
 years have said you know a song just came in over their head right home justall I had to do is write but then you
 ever see that thing where of Keats's notes for a thing of beauty is a joyforever
 it's like covers an entire pay it's like you know he's crossing thisout and that out yet so though his
 consciousness is his conscious mind is working on it but I saw I I do thinkit's a partnership and I think that I
 know when I was first starting out as a writer I worked in advertising and I andI tried to do novels that I could never
 do I was like really unskilled at getting to that tuning into that stationI just beat my brains out and was unable
 to do it you know except and because I was sort of trying too hard it was sortof like a Zen monk or a monk of some
 kind trying to meditate and just like constantly thoughts driving you crazybut overtime you know not would I've
 kind of gotten better at it and I can sort of let go of those that part of methat's trying so hard and so these
 angels can speak a little more easily

0:44:32
Speaker 1 :through the membrane can you put into
 words the process of letting go and clearing that channel of communicationwhat does it take that's like another


0:44:40
Speaker 0 :great question for me it just took I
 took probably thirty years and I don't even I would I guess I would liken it tomeditation even though I'm not a
 meditator but it would seem to me to be one of the hardest things in the worldto just sit still and stop thinking
 right and so it's very hard to put into words and I think that's why theseteachers of meditation use tricks and
 cones and stuff like that but for me at least I think it was just a process ofyears of years and years of trying and
 finally of beating my head in the wall and finally little by little giving upthe bet beating of the the head but this
 doesn't seem to be any trick everybody wants a tack these days and I don'tthink there is a hack I look at it in
 terms of the goddess the muse he's watching you down there beating yourhead in the ball you're like a marine
 going through an obstacle course so a martial artist trying to learn youknow like uma Thurman during the casket
 they'll try to make that little for its punch you know the muse or the goddessis just sort of watching on Lexi's turn
 saying I'm gonna come back in another couple of months and see if he's stillthere yeah and finally she'll say all
 right he's had it he's beaten he's paid his dues I'm gonna

0:46:09
Speaker 1 :give it to him so the the hard work and
 the suffering yep but you know I'm also being Russian uhin wrestling and martial arts were big
 into drilling technique I was also just even getting at there's certainlythere's no shortcut but is there a
 process so your aunt the practice that can be the process of practice so youhad to one yet an example of meditation
 so it's essentially the practice of meditation is you I think so same drill

0:46:42
Speaker 0 :I think is a good way to look at it too


0:46:45
Speaker 1 :but what do you what are you drilling
 you're just sitting and you're you're

0:46:49
Speaker 0 :writing you know just writing you're
 writing your then you're looking at what you wrote you know you're hittingmoments when it flows you know and your
 and your and in your other hitting moments well you just can't do anythingand you're trying to from the moments
 that weren't flowed you're trying to come back and look at and say what whatdid I do
 how did it how did that happen or was in my mind you know but I think it's just aprocess of over and over and over and
 over until finally it gets a little bit

0:47:21
Speaker 1 :easier and did you did you always when
 you when you read something you write did you always have a pretty good radarfor what's good enough after it's


0:47:33
Speaker 0 :written no I think I do now but but no
 it was always really hard for me to know what was good I mean do you edit the

0:47:45
Speaker 1 :process of editing is the process of
 looking at what you've written and improving it are you but a writer or aneditor


0:47:57
Speaker 0 :how often do you edit that's another
 great question great question because I do think that in writing the realprocess of looking at it is the process
 that an editor does rather than what a writer does the gentleman I was justtalking about the phone is my editor
 Sean Cohen who was the guy who bought gates of fire when he was an editor atdoubleday and who basically when I
 finish a book I give it to him and he and he gives me you know he he editingdoesn't really mean like crossing out
 commas it really means looking at the overall work and saying does it work andif it doesn't work why doesn't it work
 is there something wrong here you know like if you were building the GoldenGate Bridge you know and one span was
 out of whack you know you could and I think a really skilled editor what Seanis understands what what makes a story
 tick and he also has the perspective that I've lost and something I've wrotebecause I'm so close to it to say you
 know this you know this isn't working and that is working what kind of advice

0:49:05
Speaker 1 :is he giving you is it like lay out like
 this story doesn't flow correctly like it's you shouldn't start at this pointor does he even sit back at a higher
 level and say I see what you're doing but you could do better

0:49:21
Speaker 0 :no he doesn't do that okay but a lot of
 it is about genre and kind of the defining what genre you're working inand I'm gonna get up here to Jim this
 was one where Sean tore this down and made me start from scratch and what thethe specifics of it were really this is
 a supernatural thriller that's the genre sort of like Rosemary's Baby or TheExorcist and what he made what he showed
 me was that I kind of I had violated certain conventions of the genre youknow that and you can't do that you know
 it's got to be you know it has to be done the right wayand so he pointed out certain things to


0:50:18
Speaker 1 :me he must be a prolific reader himself
 - actually that's such an it's a tough

0:50:25
Speaker 0 :job of editor yeah again he was sort of
 born to do that he just kind of glommed onto it and and but since he was hisfirst job publishing you know cat fur
 Hillhurst you know cat detective but you know he studied how it works what makesa story work etc etc so he really he's
 great and I think any really successful writer unless they're utterly brillianton their own has got to have a great
 editor behind them but you yourself edit

0:50:58
Speaker 1 :

0:50:59
Speaker 0 :as well I'm constantly trying to learn
 from him and teach myself everything you see in my blog posts about that it'sabout the craft of writing is me trying
 to teach myself the rules so that you know I'm sure it's the same in martialarts or anything else right you you try
 to not be dependent on that other person because it's so painful to make thosemistakes you really feel like god I wish
 I could get it right the first time the next time I do it well research would go

0:51:29
Speaker 1 :through that in research more than
 writing so what you do is a little more solitary uh-huh in research there'susually two three four people working on
 something together and we write a paper and there's that painful process ofwhere you write it down and then you
 share it with other and not only do they criticize the writing they criticize thefundamental aspects of the approach
 you've taken I would think so so that's

0:51:55
Speaker 0 :exactly like you know they would say
 you're attacking you're asking the wrong

0:52:00
Speaker 1 :questions right - yeah and that's
 extremely you know pay off especially when you it was yespainful and helpful but there's
 disagreement and so on it's and through that comes out a betterproduct yeah and if is you want to still
 have an ego but you also want to silence it every once in a while so there's abalance in your book the war of art you
 talk about resistance with capital R as the invisible force in thisuniverse of ours that finds a way to
 prevent you from starting or doing the work where do you think resistant comesfrom why is there force in our mind
 that's constantly trying to jeopardize our efforts with laziness excuses and so

0:52:46
Speaker 0 :on that's another great question I mean
 in in Jewish mysticism in Kabbalistic thinking it's called the yetzer Hararight and it's a force that if this up
 here is your soul of neshama trying to talk to youus down here the answer Harrah's this
 negative force in the middle so I'm not the only one that ever thought aboutthis but and I don't know if anybody
 really knows the answer but here's my answer I think that there are two placeswhere we as human beings can seat our
 identity one is the ego a conscious ego and the other is the greater self andthe self in the in the Union sense the
 self in a Jungian sense includes the unconscious and butts up against whatJung called the divine ground which what
 I would call the muse the goddess or whateverand I think and the ego is just this
 little dot inside this bigger self and the ego has a completely different viewof of life as from the self the ego
 believes I'm going to give you a long answer here like no perfect the egobelieves that death is real the ego
 believes that time and space are real the ego believes that each one of us isseparate from the other
 I'm separate from you I could punch you in the face and it wouldn't hurt me itwould only hurt you and in the egos
 world the dominant emotion is fear because we were all made of flesh we canall die we can all be hurt we can all be
 ruined bumpity-bump so we were protecting ourselves and even our desireto create as we were talking about
 before comes out of that fear of death the self on the other handthe crater self that butts up against
 the divine ground believes that death is not real that time and space are notreal that the gods travel swiftest
 thought and the ego also believes that I mean the self believes that there's nodifference between you and me that we're
 all one if I hurt you I hurt myself karma right and in the world of the selfof the greater self the dominant emotion
 is love not fear now so I think that let me I'll go farther back here a long wayto answer your question when Jesus died
 on the cross or when the 300 Spartans willingly sacrificed their lives atThermopylae they were acting according
 to the rules of the self death is not real no difference between you and metime and space are not real predominant
 emotion is love so in my opinion we as conscious human vessels have are in astruggle between these two things the
 ego and the self to me resistance is the voice of the ego saying and it's afearful voice because if when we
 identify with the self we move our consciousness over to the self as asartists or scientists opening ourselves
 up to the cosmic dimension to the to the other forces the ego is tremendouslythreatened by that because if we're if
 we're in that space that headspace we don't need the ego anymore so I thinkresistance is a voice of the ego trying
 to keep control of us you there in a way I'll give you a bad example Trump is theego it's probably a very good example


0:56:32
Speaker 1 :

0:56:33
Speaker 0 :right you know it's a zero-sum world for
 him yes and for anybody that's in that and the opposite of that would besomebody like Martin Luther King or
 Gandhi and that's of course why they all wind up getting assassinatedbecause that voice that ego is hanging
 on to itself and feels so threatened yeah by I could talk more about this ifyou want to know for sure that that's


0:57:02
Speaker 1 :that's fascinating is just it's
 interesting why the fear is attached the ego I really like this dichotomy of egoand self and that struggle
 it's just ego has a you know the the self obsession of it why why fear such apredominant thing like why is resistance
 trying to undermine everything the it's

0:57:30
Speaker 0 :very here it's out of fear let's think
 about the whole thing in terms of stories in a story the villain is alwaysresistance is always the ego the hero is
 is always of course always not everything but you know what I meanpretty much it represents kind of the
 self if you think about the alien on the spaceship that's like the ultimate kindof villain it keeps changing form right
 first it goes on the guy's face then it pops out of his chest but it always justhas that one monomaniacal thing to
 destroy you know and just like the ego just like resistance and maybe alien isa bad example because Sigourney Weaver
 has to sort of fight on the same terms as as the alien but maybe a betterexample might be something like
 Casablanca where in the end the Pumphrey Bogart character has to acting operatingout of the self has to give up his his
 selfish dream of going off with Ingrid Bergman Nilsa lund the love of his lifeand instead you know puts around the
 plane to Lisbon while he goes off to fight the Nazis and you know in thedesert
 I don't know if that's clear but in a but in almost every story the villain isthe ego its resistance is fear is that
 zero-sum thing and in almost every story the hero is someone that is willing tomake a sacrifice to help others it's


0:59:10
Speaker 1 :letting go of that fear is what leads
 the productivity into success yeah do you think there's a it that'sprobably the answer is either obvious or
 impossible but do you think there's an evolutionary advantage to resistancelike what would life look like without
 resistance that sort of that's another

0:59:36
Speaker 0 :great question I think I also believe
 that resistance like death gives a meaning to life right if we didn't haveit it's gonna be you know what would we
 be we'd be in the Garden of Eden picking fruit and just happy and stupid you knowand I do think that that myth of the
 Garden of Eden is really about this kind of thing you know where where Adam andEve decide to sort of take matters into
 their own hands and and acquire knowledge that until then God had saidI'm the only one that's got that
 knowledge and of course once they have acquired that knowledge they're cast outinto the world you and I live in now
 where they do have to deal with that fear and they do have to deal with allthat stuff is the human condition the


1:00:27
Speaker 1 :human condition and the meaning and the
 purpose comes from the resistance being there and the struggle to overcome itthe overcoming right that's and also the


1:00:39
Speaker 0 :other aspect of it is that it's not real
 at all it's not even like it's an actual force it's all here right so the thesort of in a way it's sort of a
 surrender to it you know you know or

1:01:01
Speaker 1 :

1:01:03
Speaker 0 :like turning on the light in a dark


1:01:07
Speaker 1 :thing it's like it's gone but not quite


1:01:11
Speaker 0 :because it's not quite because it comes


1:01:13
Speaker 1 :back again tomorrow morning exactly so
 you have to keep changing lightbulbs every day so what's been uh mayberecently but in general maybe you know
 life what's been the most relentless or one of the more relentless sources ofresistance to you personally I mean it's


1:01:28
Speaker 0 :always the same it's about writing for
 me and an evolving within my own body of work you know it never goes away itnever gets any less you have particular


1:01:44
Speaker 1 :excuses particular justifications that


1:01:50
Speaker 0 :come out no it's always the same well I
 would say it's always its same but it's really not because resistance is soprotein you know it keeps changing form
 and as you as you move to hopefully a higher level resistance gets a littlemore nuanced and a little more subtle
 trying to fake you out but I think you learn that it's always there and you'realways gonna have to face it


1:02:14
Speaker 1 :so I mean you're but your battle is
 sitting down and writing to some number Awards to a blank page yeah give aprocess there with his battle you have a
 number of hours you put end honestly

1:02:31
Speaker 0 :yeah I'm definitely a a believer that
 even though this battle is fought on the highest sort of spiritual level that theway you fight it is on the most mundane
 I'm sure it's like martial arts must be the same way I mean I go to the gymfirst thing in the morning and I sort of
 am rehearsing myself faced you know the gym is called resistance training rightyou're working against resistance right
 yeah and I don't want to go I don't want to get out of bed I hate that you knowso but I'm sort of fortifying myself to
 to be ready for the day and you know like I said over not would over yearsI've learned to sort of
 get into the right kind of mindset and it's not as hard for me as it used to bethe real resistance I think for me and I
 think this is true for anybody is the question of sort of what's the next ideawhat's the next book what's the next
 project that you're going to work on and when I when I ask that question I'msorry I'm asking it of the muse I'm kind
 of saying what do you want me or I'm asking it up my unconscious if we'relooking at Bruce Springsteen's albums
 it's kind of well what's the next album you know now he's on Broadway that was agreat idea
 right um where'd that come from you know but and then for him what's what's afterthat you know because that that body of
 work is already alive it already exists inside us canonical woman's biologicalclock and we have to serve it and we
 have to otherwise it'll give us cancer you know I don't mean to say that ifanybody has cancer that they're not yeah
 but you know what I mean it'll it'll do it'll take it's a revenge on us so thenext of the resistance to me is sort of
 well a big aspect of it is what's next you know when I finish the book I'mworking on now I'm not sure what I'm
 gonna do next and I see at the same time you have a

1:04:34
Speaker 1 :kind of you have a sense that there is a
 Bruce Springsteen single line of albums so like it's it's already knownsomewhere in the universe what you're
 going to do next is the sense you have

1:04:52
Speaker 0 :in it in a sense yes I don't know if
 it's like predetermined you know but it's but there's something like that

1:04:59
Speaker 1 :yeah I'd like to believe that there's uh
 was this kind of like quantum mechanics I guess once once you observe it maybeonce you talk to the muse it's it's it's
 one thing for sure it was always going to be that one thing but really inreality it's a distribution it could be
 any number of things yeah I think so

1:05:20
Speaker 0 :there's an alternate reality alternate


1:05:22
Speaker 1 :realities they're not that far apart I


1:05:24
Speaker 0 :mean Bruce Springsteen is not gonna
 write you know a Joni Mitchell you know no matter how hard he's

1:05:31
Speaker 1 :probably when I'm brought I mean he
 still did that which is not a Bruce Springsteen thing to do so I think Ithink you're being in retrospect I think


1:05:39
Speaker 0 :it is making things you know it's a next
 sort of evolution form why not take his music to there you know in retrospect it

1:05:46
Speaker 1 :all makes sense I think yeah because he
 if you pull it off especially do you visualize yourself completing the worklike Olympic athletes visualize getting
 the gold medal do you you know they that's they go through Imean that's actually a really you can
 learn something from athletes on that is um years out certainly two three yearsawesome some people do much longer
 everyday you visualize how the day of the the championship will go yet down toI mean everything down to how will it
 feel to stand on the podium and so on do you do anything like that you know howyou approach writing
 no because no moment because yeah it

1:06:32
Speaker 0 :isn't a moment I think because it's such
 a mystery you just don't know I think it's different from sports right because

1:06:39
Speaker 1 :you don't know that this thing there's
 no gold medal

1:06:42
Speaker 0 :do you know in fact I would like to
 think and that as soon as you finish one the next day you're on the other and infact hopefully you've already started
 the other you're already you know one hundred pages into the other when youfinish the first one but it is a it is a
 it's a journey it's a process I don't think it is a in fact I think it's verydangerous to think that way hmm to think
 oh this I'm gonna win the Oscar you know

1:07:20
Speaker 1 :it's interesting for the creative
 process it might be dangerous itit's it's a maybe you can like why is it


1:07:29
Speaker 0 :dangerous because I kind of Zoey go it's


1:07:32
Speaker 1 :the e because you're giving yourself


1:07:33
Speaker 0 :over to the ego you know I keep saying
 this myself my job I'm a servant of the muse I am there to do what she tells meto do and if I've suddenly think oh I'm
 really I just want to you know whatever news doesn't like that yeah and you knowyeah he's on another dimension for me


1:07:57
Speaker 1 :I'm trying to square that cuz I agree
 I'm trying to square that with I think there's a meditation to visualizingsuccess in the athletic realm to where
 it focuses it removes everything else away to where you focus on thisparticular battle I mean I think that
 you can do that in many kinds of ways and in sports the ego serves a moreimportant role I think than it does in
 writing any the ego there's something

1:08:33
Speaker 0 :well no let me when you say that I know
 what you mean Alexa do you think there is a sort of uh you know it'sinteresting to watch
 if interviews was with Steph Curry yeah who's such obviously such a nice guy buthe's got such tremendous self-confidence
 you know that it but it doesn't border on ego so much because he's worked sohard for it you know but he knows so he
 has visualized he has visualized maybe not so much winning you know that asjust him being the best he can be him
 being in the flow you know doing his thing that he knows he can do and I dothink in the creative world yeah there
 is a sort of a thing like that where you were and you know a choreographer or afilmmaker or whatever might
 be do an internal thing where they're saying I can make an oscar-winning movieI can direct this movie you know I'm
 banishing these thoughts that I'm not good enough I can do that I can I canedit it I can score it I can you know
 bump it a month a month but and I don't think that's really ego I think that'sthat's part of the process in a good way
 like an athlete does that so extreme

1:09:55
Speaker 1 :confidence is what some of the best
 athletes come come with and you think it's possible to as a writer to haveextreme confidence in yourself I do


1:10:04
Speaker 0 :think so you know that I'm sure when
 John Lennon sat down to write a song he felt like [ __ ] I can do this you know

1:10:14
Speaker 1 :I'm not so sure I I think I think is
 this the great artist has seen any that you're you're haunted by self-doubtit's that resist I mean the confidence


1:10:25
Speaker 0 :yes but I mean I guess but even beyond
 the cell and then the cell above the self-doubt I was the biggest organ picksyourself the leaf you know some yeah I'm
 freaking out yeah I'm worried that I'm not gonna be able to but you know I knowI could do this yeah when you look at it


1:10:38
Speaker 1 :when you take a bigger picture yeah so
 the writing process is it fundamentally

1:10:49
Speaker 0 :lonely so no and because you're with
 your characters you are so you really

1:10:55
Speaker 1 :put yourself in the world absolutely you


1:10:58
Speaker 0 :know I've written about this before that
 I used to have my desk used to face a wall instead of seeing and people wouldsay well don't you want to look out the
 window but I'm I'm in here I mean I'm seeing you know the Spartans I'm seeingyou know whatever and the character
 characters that are on the page or that you create are not accidents you knowthey're coming out of some issue some
 deep issue that you have whether you realize it or not you might not realizeit till twenty years later or somebody
 explains it to you so your characters are kind of fascinating to you and theirdilemmas are fascinating to you and
 you're also trying to to come to grips with them you know yousort of see them through a glass darkly
 you know and you really want to see them more clearly so yeah I know it's notlonely at all fact I'm more lonely
 sometimes later going out to dinner with some people and actually talking to

1:11:58
Speaker 1 :people do you miss the characters after


1:12:02
Speaker 0 :it's over uh let's say I have I have
 affection for them kind of like children that have gone off to college and nowour you know you only see them at
 Thanksgiving definitely I have affection for even the bad guys maybe especially

1:12:21
Speaker 1 :

1:12:21
Speaker 0 :the bad guys especially the bad guys


1:12:24
Speaker 1 :you've said that writers even successful
 writers are often not tough minded enough I've read then post that you haveto be a professional in a way you handle
 your emotions you have to be a bit of a warrior to be a writerso what are what do you think makes a
 warrior is that as a warrior born or trained in the realm and the biggerrealm in the realm of writing in the


1:12:54
Speaker 0 :creative process I think I think they're
 born to some extent you have the gift like you might have a gift as a martialartist to do whatever martial artists do
 but the training is the big thing 90% training 10% 10% genetics and youknow I use another analogy other than
 warrior 2 as far as writers and it's like to be a mother if you think aboutif you're a writer or any creative
 person you're giving birth to something right you're carrying a new life insideyou and in terms of bravery if your
 child your two-year-old child is underneath a car is coming down thestreet the mothers are gonna splake stop
 a Buick you know with their bare hands so that's a that's another way to thinkabout how how a writer has to think
 about or any creative person has to think about I think what they're whatthey're doing that what this
 this child this new creation that they're bringing forth yeah so the hard

1:13:52
Speaker 1 :work that's underlying that have just a
 couple weeks ago talked to just happen to be in the same room both gave talksArianna Huffington I did this
 conversation her I didn't know much about her before before then but she hasrecently been short a couple books have
 been promoting a lifestyle where she basically she created a huffington postand she gave herself like I don't know
 20 hours a day just obsessed with her work and then she she fainted passed outand kind of uh there was some health
 issues and so she wrote this book saying that you know sleep basically you wantto establish a lifestyle that doesn't
 sacrifice health that's productive but there's a sec of myself she thinks hecan have both productivity and health
 criticizing Elon Musk who have also spoken with for working too hard andthereby sacrificing you know being less
 effective than he could be so I'm trying to get at this balance between healthand obsessively working at something and
 really working hard so I'm what Arianna is talking about it make sense to mewhen I'm a little bit torn to me passion
 and reason do not overlap much or at all sometimes maybe I'm being too rushingbut I feel madness and obsession does
 not care for health or sleep or diet or any of that and hard work it's hard workand and everything else can go to hell
 so if you're really focused on whether it's writing a book and it shouldeverything should just go to hell where
 do you stand on this balance how important is health for productivity howimportant is it to sort of get sleep and


1:15:48
Speaker 0 :so on I'm from out of the health side
 yeah I mean there was a period of my life when I was justI had no obligations and I was just
 living in a little house and just working non-stopyou know but even then I would get up in
 the morning and I would have liver and eggs for breakfast yeah every day and Iwould do my you know exercise whatever
 it was but although I was still doing like you know 18 hours a day but I I'mdefinitely I kind of think of it sort of
 like an athlete does yeah I'm sure that like Steph Curry is is totally committedto winning championships and stuff like
 that but he has his family he sees his family you know the family is alwaysthere he I'm sure he eats you know
 perfect great stuff gets to sleep you know gets that the the train you knowthough whatever a trainer does Silver's
 knees and ankles and whatever so I or Kobe Bryant or anybody that's a it'soperating in a high level so I do think
 I'm from that kind of the health school the good thing about being a writer isit don't you can't work for many hours a
 day you know four hours is like the maximum I can work I've never been ableto work more than that I don't know how
 people do it heard of people do ten twelve I don'tknow how they do it so that gives you a
 lot of other time to optimize your

1:17:14
Speaker 1 :

1:17:16
Speaker 0 :health yeah because you need to you're
 in training you know you're you're really you're burning up a lot of Bvitamins when you're working here yeah


1:17:24
Speaker 1 :but uh maybe it's a Russian thing with


1:17:26
Speaker 0 :you Lex


1:17:29
Speaker 1 :well it's not even a Russian thing I


1:17:30
Speaker 0 :mean it also may be youth you know at 35
 you can be crazy you know this this that

1:17:35
Speaker 1 :they they keep telling me but I'm pretty
 sure I'll be at it still at a later time too I think it has to do with the careerchoice too I think writing is most for
 whatever thing I've heard it's almost impossible to do more than a few hoursreally well the when you start to get
 into certain disciplines like oh I'm asking me engineering disciplines thatreally there's a lot more non muse time
 meaning mmm right right so the crazy hours of your talk that youoften are talking about have to be done
 mm-hmm and it doesn't I think that's true yeah so there's still the two-threehours of music time needed for truly
 genius ideas but it's uh it's something it's something I'd certainly strugglewith but yeah I I hear you loud and
 clear on the health so what does the perfect day look like for you if we'retalking about writing an hour-by-hour
 schedule of a perfect day I get up early

1:18:49
Speaker 0 :I go to the gym I have breakfast with
 some friends of mine

1:18:57
Speaker 1 :I welcome early by the way that's like a


1:19:00
Speaker 0 :

1:19:01
Speaker 1 :how 13 am a.m. so we're talking really


1:19:05
Speaker 0 :really early you know I'm crazy early
 it's ridiculously early yeah but and I haven't done that always but that's kindof what what what I'm on now so I'm in
 bed like it when I'm with my my nephews that are like four years old and threeyears old I'm in bed before them okay um


1:19:24
Speaker 1 :you got a beat you wake up it's a sorry
 you said exercise first yeah and what does that look like what's exercise for

1:19:33
Speaker 0 :you I go to the gym I have a trainer I
 have a couple guys that I work out with and I'll you know it's maybe an hourmaybe a little more I'll do a little
 warm-up before of stretching afterwards take a shower go have breakfast but it'san intense kind of a thing that I
 definitely don't want to do that's hard you know so you feel like you've

1:19:56
Speaker 1 :accomplished something first thing yeah
 a big accomplishment of the day at the

1:20:00
Speaker 0 :same time it's not like so hard that I'm
 completely exhausted you know and then I'll come home and handle whatevercorrespondence and stuff has to be done
 and then I work for maybe three hours and then I just sort of crash that theoffice is closed I turn the switch I
 don't think about any I don't think about anythingI don't think about the work at all do


1:20:23
Speaker 1 :you listen to
 Oh II mean afterwards after work once

1:20:25
Speaker 0 :the office is closed but during so this


1:20:27
Speaker 1 :was like 12 to 3 kind of thing something
 like that something like that but the you listen to music no if and yes that's

1:20:36
Speaker 0 :just me I mean I don't think you know if
 somebody could this fast in different

1:20:40
Speaker 1 :ways it's fascinating you know the I
 mean you've also of most of many writers you've really but like I've heard evenKingston writing is you've optimized
 this conversation with the muse you're having that optimized but you've atleast thought about it so what can you
 say a little bit more about the trivialities of that process of like yousaid facing the wall what's do you have


1:21:13
Speaker 0 :little ritual I mean like the granular


1:21:15
Speaker 1 :aspect of granular aspects yeah


1:21:17
Speaker 0 :is there little rituals I do have all
 kinds of well I'm not even going to tell you I'm sure but the one thing and Idon't want to like to talk about this
 too much because it sort of jinxes things I think but the one thing I I dotry to do is when I then when I sit down
 I immediately get into it first second yeah I don't sit and [ __ ] around withanything immediately try to get into it
 as as quickly as I can and the other thing is that writing a book orscreenplay or anything like that is a
 process of multiple drafts and it's the first draft that's where you're mostwith the muse where you're going through
 the blank page like right now I'm on I don't know what the fifth or sixthseventh draft of some other thing I'm
 working on so when I'm I've got pages already written and I'm kind of readingthem afresh as I as I go through the
 story so it's not quite where I am now it's not quite a deep muse scenariopartly it is but it's also sort of
 bouncing back and forth between the different between the right brain andthe left brain I'm kind of looking at it
 and trying to evaluate it then I'm going into it and try to change it a little

1:22:35
Speaker 1 :bit when uh do you know sit down
 do you know the night before of what that starting point is yeah I always try

1:22:43
Speaker 0 :to stop and I learned this I think
 Hemingway wrote about this or done Steinbeck or one of the or maybe both ofthem to always stop when you kind of
 know what's coming next so you're not I'd have facing a chasm you know yeah

1:22:58
Speaker 1 :okay so and afterwards when you're done
 the office is closed offices closed I

1:23:03
Speaker 0 :let the muse take care of it you know I
 don't know I don't want to and I think it's a very unhealthy thing to worryabout it or think about any creative


1:23:14
Speaker 1 :process you don't I got a long walk


1:23:18
Speaker 0 :later think about yeah if that then I
 will sort of keep my mind open to it but I won't be like obsessing about it yeahthere's a actually on walks sometimes
 things pop in your head you know and you go oh I should change that but that'snot your ego doing it that's a deeper


1:23:35
Speaker 1 :level okay so how does the day end so in
 terms of writing so yet the writing you know writing the the office door closesand then the rest of the day just do


1:23:48
Speaker 0 :whatever the hell maybe go out to dinner
 my girlfriend is not here now she's in New York working we'll make dinner orwhatever go out to dinner something like
 that and maybe maybe I'll read something nothing heavy and I go to bed prettyearly and um the gym is a big thing for
 me already if sorry probably would you like with you with martial arts thenight before I'll be I'll be visualizing
 what I have to do the next day and getting myself psyched up for that andthen let's conk out like a light and
 wake up at the crack of dawn

1:24:24
Speaker 1 :so looking out into the future
 this year next few years what do you think the muse has in store for you I

1:24:33
Speaker 0 :don't think you can ever know it's
 probably something along the same I really believe you know there's thatexercise where you where they say to you
 visualize yourself five years in the future then write a letter to your fromthat person to yourself I don't
 leaving that at all because I don't think you can you know there's a line inOut of Africa that God made the world
 round so that we couldn't see too far aheadyou just don't know as a writer or as a
 create a person you know I never knew my first book was The Legend of BaggerVance I hadn't before that happened I
 had no clue that I was gonna be writing anything like that on that subjectanything at all no clue until it just
 sort of came and then when I when that was done people said well you got towrite another I had no idea what it was
 which was going to be gates of fire no clue so so if somebody'd sat me down atthe start of that and asked the question
 I would have been crazy to say so I just hope as as the future unfolds that I'mopen to it you know well I think I speak


1:25:47
Speaker 1 :for a lot of people in saying that we
 look forward to with that that's thanks so much for talking satisfy yeah it's a

1:25:56
