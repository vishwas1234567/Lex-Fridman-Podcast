Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Whitney Cummings she's a stand-up comedian actor producer writer directorand recently finally the host of her
 very own podcast called good for you her most recent Netflix special calledcan I touch it features in part of robot
 she affectionately named bear claw but it's designed to be visually a replicaWhitney it's exciting for me to see one
 of my favorite comedians explore the social aspects of robotics and AI in oursociety she also has some fascinating
 ideas about human behavior psychology and neurology some of which she exploresin her book called um fine and other
 lies there's truly a pleasure to meet Whitney and have this conversation withher and he went to continue it through
 texts afterwards every once in a while late at night I'll be programming over acup of coffee and we'll get a text from
 Whitney saying something hilarious or weirder yet sending a video Bryan Callensaying something hilarious that's what I
 know the universe has a sense of humor and he gifted me with one hell of anamazing journey then I put the phone
 down and go back to programming with a stupid joyful smile on my face if youenjoy this conversation listen to it in

 to dream of engineering a better world this podcast is supported by ziprecruiter hiring great people is hard
 and to me is the most important element of a successful mission driven team I'vebeen fortunate to be a part of and to
 lead several great engineering teams the hiring I've done in the past was mostlythe tools that we built ourselves but
 reinventing the wheel was painful so zip recruiters a tool that's alreadyavailable for you it seeks to make
 hiring simple fast and smart for example codable co-founder GretchenAbner used the recruiter to find a new
 game artist to join her education tech company by using zip recruiter screeningquestions to filter candidates
 Gretchen found it easier to focus on the best candidates and finally hiring theperfect person for the role in less than
 two weeks from start to finish zip recruiter the smartest way to hirecy zip recruiters effective for
 businesses of all sizes by signing up as I did for free at zip recruiter commslash Lex pod that's zip recruiter calm
 slash Lex pod and now here's my conversation with Whitney CummingsI have trouble making eye contact as you


0:03:53
Speaker 0 :can tell me too do you know that I had
 to work on making eye contact because I used to look here do you see that yeahdo you want me to do that
 I'll do this well chief to camera but I used to do this and finally people likeI'd be on dates and guys would be like
 are you looking at my hair like they get it would make people really insecurebecause I didn't really get a lot of eye
 contact as a kid it's it's one two three years did you not get a lot of mycontact as a kid I don't know I haven't


0:04:16
Speaker 1 :done the soul-searching right so I but
 there's definitely some psychological is she makes me uncomfortable yeah for somereason want to connect eyes I start to
 think I assume that you're judging me oh

0:04:31
Speaker 0 :why am we all are all right the POC has
 to be me and you both do you think

0:04:40
Speaker 1 :robots of the future ones with human
 level intelligence will be female male genderless or another gender who havenot yet created as a society you're the


0:04:52
Speaker 0 :expert at this well I'm gonna ask you


0:04:56
Speaker 1 :the answer I'm gonna ask you questions
 that maybe nobody knows the answer to or alright and then I just want you tohypothesize as a as a imaginative author
 director comedian can we just be very

0:05:10
Speaker 0 :clear that you know a ton about this and
 I know nothing about this but I have thought a lot about yes what I thinkrobots can fix in our society and I mean
 I'm a comedian it's my job to study human nature to make jokes about humannature and to sometimes play devil's
 advocate and I just see such a tremendous negativity around robots orat least the idea of robots that it was
 like oh I'm just gonna take the opposite side for fun for jokes and then I waslike oh no I really agree and this
 devil's advocate argument so I please correct me when I'm wrong about this

0:05:48
Speaker 1 :stuff so so first of all there's there's
 no right and wrong because we're all I think most of the people working onrobotics are really not actually even
 thinking about some of the big picture things that you've been exploring infact uh your robot what's-her-name by
 the

0:06:05
Speaker 0 :we'll go on bear claw


0:06:08
Speaker 1 :what's the genesis of that name by the


0:06:11
Speaker 0 :way would bear claw was I god I don't
 even remember the joke cuz i black out after I shoot specials but I was writingsomething about like the pet names that
 men call women like cupcake sweetie honey you know like we're always namedafter desserts or something and I was
 just writing a joke about um if you want to call us a dessert at least pick likea cool dessert you know like bear claw
 like something cool so I ended up

0:06:36
Speaker 1 :calling her bad luck so do you think the
 future robots of greater and greater intelligence will like to make themfemale male would we like to assign them
 gender or would we'd like to move away from gender and say something more

0:06:53
Speaker 0 :ambiguous I think it depends on their
 purpose you know I feel like if it's a sex robot it people prefer certaingenders you know and I also you know
 when I went down and explored the robot Factory I was asking about the type ofpeople that bought sex robots and I was
 very surprised at the answer because of course the stereotype was it's gonna bea bunch of perverts it ended up being a
 lot of people that were handicapped a lot of people with erectile dysfunctionand a lot of people that were exploring
 their sexuality a lot of people that were thought they were gay but weren'tsure but didn't want to take the risk of
 trying on someone that could reject them and being embarrassed or they werecloseted or in a city where maybe that's
 you know taboo and stigmatized you know so I think that a gendered sex robotthat would serve an important purpose
 for someone trying to explore their sexuality am i into man let me try onthis thing first alien to women let me
 try on this thing first so I think gendered robots would be important forthat I think genderless robots in terms
 of emotional support robots babysitters I'm fine for a genderless babysitterwith my husband in the house you know
 there are places that I think that genderless makes a lot of sense butobviously not in the sex area what do


0:08:06
Speaker 1 :you mean with your husband in the house
 what does that have to do with the

0:08:11
Speaker 0 :gender of the robot but I mean I don't
 have a husband but hypothetically speaking I think every woman's worstnightmare is like the hot babysitter
 you know so I think that there is a common place I think for genderless youknow teachers doctors all that kind of
 it would be very awkward if the first robotic doctor was a guy or the firstrobotic nurse is a woman you know it's
 sort of that stuff is still loaded I think that genderless could just takethe unnecessary drama out of it and
 possibility to sexualize them or be triggered by any of that stuff so

0:08:48
Speaker 1 :there's two components to this it's a
 bear claw so one is the voice and the talking so on and then there's thevisual appearance so on the topic of
 gender and generalists in your experience what has been the value ofthe physical appearance so what has it
 added much to the depth of the

0:09:08
Speaker 0 :interaction I mean mines
 kind of an extenuating circumstance because she is supposed to look exactlylike me I mean I spent six months
 getting my face molded and having you know the idea was I was exploring theconcept of Ken robots replace us because
 that's the big fear but also the big dream in a lot of ways and I wanted todig into that area because you know for
 a lot of people it's like they're gonna take our jobs they're gonna replace uslegitimate fear but then a lot of women
 I know are like I would love for a robot to replace me every now and then so itcan go to baby showers for me and it can
 pick up my kids at school and it can cook dinner and whatever so I just thinkthat was an interesting place to explore
 so her looking like me was a big part of it now her looking like me just adds anunnecessary level of insecurity cuz I
 got our year ago and she already looks younger than me so weird problem yeahbut I think that her looking human was
 the idea and I think that where we are now please correct me if I'm wrong overhuman robot resembling an actual human
 you know is going to feel more realistic than some generic face what you're

0:10:13
Speaker 1 :saying that that robots that have some
 familiarity like looks similar to somebody that you actually know you beable to form a deeper connection with
 that was the question that's an open question I don't I don'tno it's an interesting or the opposite


0:10:30
Speaker 0 :if then you know me and you're like why
 I know this isn't real because you're right here maybe it does the opposite we

0:10:36
Speaker 1 :have a very keen eye for human faces and
 they're able to detect strangeness especially that one has to do withpeople we've whose faces we've seen a
 lot of them so I tend to be a bigger fan of moving away completely from faces

0:10:52
Speaker 0 :

0:10:53
Speaker 1 :recognizable faces no just human faces


0:10:55
Speaker 0 :at all in general because I think that's
 where things get dicey and one thing I will say is I think my robot is morerealistic than other robots not
 necessarily because you have seen me and then you see heard you go oh they're sosimilar but also because human faces are
 flawed and asymmetrical and sometimes we forget when we're making things thatsupposed to look human we make them too
 symmetrical and that's what makes them stop looking human so because they moldin my symmetrical face she just even if
 someone didn't know who I was I think she'd look more realistic than mostgeneric ones that didn't have some kind
 of flaws got it you know cuz they start looking creepy when they're toosymmetrical because human beings aren't


0:11:33
Speaker 1 :ya know the flaws is what it means to be
 human so visually as well but I'm just a fan of the idea of letting humans use alittle bit more imagination so just
 hearing the voice is enough for us humans to then start imagining thevisual appearance that goes along with
 that voice and you don't necessarily need to work too hard on creating theactual visual appearance mm-hmm so
 there's some value to that when you step into the stereo of actually building arobot that looks like bear claws such a
 long road of facial expressions of sort of making everything smiling winking yeprolling their eyes all that kind of
 stuff it gets really really tricky it

0:12:16
Speaker 0 :gets tricky and I think I'm again I'm a
 comedian like I'm obsessed with what makes us human and our human nature andthe nasty side of human nature tends to
 be where I've you know ended up exploring over and over again and I wasjust mostly fascinated by people's
 reactions so it's my job to get the biggest reaction from a group ofstrangers the loudest possible reaction
 and I just had this instinct just when I started building her and people gooh and screechin people scream in there
 I mean I bring around on stage and people would scream and I just to methat was the next level of entertainment
 getting a laugh I've done that I know how to do that I think comedians werealways trying to figure out what the
 next level is and comedies evolving so much and you know Jordan Peele had justdone you know these genius comedy horror
 movies which feel like the next level of comedy to me and this sort of funnyhorror of a robot was fascinating to me
 but I think the thing that I got the most obsessed with was people beingfreaked out and scared of her and I
 started digging around with pathogen avoidance and the idea that we'veessentially evolved to be repelled by
 anything that looks human but is off a little bit anything that could be sickor diseased or dead essentially as our
 reptilian brains way to get us to not Procrit try to have sex with itbasically you know so I got really
 fascinated by how freaked out and scared I mean I would see grown men get upsetyou get something away from me like
 angry and it was like you know that what this is you you know but the sort oflike you know amygdala getting activated
 by something that to me is just a fun toy said a lot about our history as aspecies and what got us into trouble


0:14:04
Speaker 1 :thousands of years ago so it's that it's
 the deep down stuff that's in our genetics but also is it just are peoplefreaked out by the fact that there's a
 robot so it's not just the appearance but there's an artificial human anything

0:14:17
Speaker 0 :people I think and I'm just always also
 fascinated by the blind spots humans have so the idea that you're afraid ofthat I mean how many robots have killed
 people how many humans have died at the hands of other humans yeah many morehundreds of millions yet we're scared of
 that and we'll go to the grocery store and be around a bunch of humans whostatistically the chances are much
 higher that you're gonna get killed by humans so I'm just fascinated by withoutjudgement how irrational we are is the


0:14:47
Speaker 1 :worry is the exponential so it's you
 know you could say the same thing about nuclear weapons before we dropped onHiroshima
 Masaki so the worry that people have is the exponential growth so so it's likeoh it's fun and games right now but you
 know overnight especially if a robot provides value to society we'll put onein every home and then all of a sudden
 lose track of the actual large-scale impact it has in society and then allsudden gain greater and greater control
 to where we'll all be you know affect our political system and then affect our

0:15:25
Speaker 0 :decision did not just already happen


0:15:28
Speaker 1 :which ones Oh Russia hacking no offense


0:15:31
Speaker 0 :but hasn't already happened I mean that
 was like an algorithm of negative things

0:15:38
Speaker 1 :being clicked on more we'd like to tell
 stories and like to demonize certain people I think nobody understands ourcurrent political system or discourse on
 Twitter the Twitter mobs nobody has a sense not Twitter not Facebook thepeople running it nobody understands the
 impact for these algorithms they're trying their best yeah despite whatpeople think they're not like a bunch of
 lefties trying to make sure that Hillary Clinton gets elected it's more that it'san incredibly complex system that we
 don't and that's the worry it's so complex and moves so fast that nobodywill be able to stop it once it happens


0:16:15
Speaker 0 :and let me ask the question this is a
 very savage question yeah which is is this just the next stage of evolution ashumans and people will die yes I mean
 that's always happens you know is this is just taking emotion out of it is thisbasically the next stage of survival of


0:16:34
Speaker 1 :the fittest yeah you have to think of
 organisms you know what is it mean to be a living organism like it's a smartphonepart of your living organism or where


0:16:46
Speaker 0 :we're in relationships with our phones


0:16:49
Speaker 1 :yeah but it's sex through them with them


0:16:51
Speaker 0 :what's the difference between with them


0:16:54
Speaker 1 :and through them but it also expands
 your cognitive abilities expands your memory knowledge and so on so you're amuch smarter person because you have a


0:17:02
Speaker 0 :smart phone in your hand but if what as
 soon as it's out of my hands we've got big problems because we become sort ofso morphed with them


0:17:08
Speaker 1 :with an assembly otic relationship and
 that's what the er mosque when you're a link is working on trying to increasethe bandwidth communication between
 computers and your brain and so further and further expand our ability as humanbeings to sort of leverage machines and
 maybe that's the future the evolution next evolutionary step it could be alsothat yes we'll give birth just like we
 give birth to human children right now to give birth day I in other places Ithink it's a really interesting
 possibility I'm gonna play devil's

0:17:42
Speaker 0 :advocate I just think that the fear of
 robots is wildly classist because I mean Facebook like it's easy for us to saythey're taking their data okay a lot of
 people that get employment off of Facebook they are able to get income offof Facebook they don't care if you take
 their phone numbers and their emails and their data as long as it's free theydon't want to have to pay five dollars a
 month or Facebook Facebook is a wildly Democratic thing forget about theelection and all that kind of stuff you
 know a lot of you know technology making people's lives easier it I find thatmost elite people are more scared than
 lower-income people so and women for the most part so the idea of somethingthat's stronger than us and that might
 eventually kill us like women are used to that like that's not I see a lot oflike really wit rich men being like the
 robots are gonna kill us we're like what's another thing that's gonna killus you know I tend to see like oh
 something can walk me to my car at night like something can help me cook dinneror something you know for you know
 people in underprivileged countries who can't afford eye surgery like you knowrobot can we send a robot to
 under-privileged you know places to do surgery where they can't I work withthis organization cooperation smile
 where they do cleft palate surgeries and there's a lot of places that can't do avery simple surgery because they can't
 afford doctors and medical care and such so I just see and this can be completelynaive and should be completely wrong but
 I feel like we're a lot of people are going like the robots are gonna destroyus humans we're destroying ourselves
 we're self-destructing robots to me are the only hope to clean up all the messesthat we've created even when we go try
 to clean up pollution in the ocean we make it worse because of the oil thatthe tankers
 it's like to me robots are the only solution you know firefighters areheroes but they're limited and how many
 times they can run into a fire you know so there's just something interesting tome I'm not hearing a lot of like lower
 income more vulnerable populations

0:19:39
Speaker 1 :talking about robots maybe you can speak
 that a little bit more there's an idea I think you've expressed that I've heardactually a few female writers and
 roboticist I've talked to express this idea that exactly you just said which isit just seems that being being afraid of
 existential threats of artificial intelligence is is a male issue yeah itand I wonder what that is
 if it because because men have in certain positions like you said it'salso classist issue they haven't been
 humbled by life and so you're always look for the biggest problems to take on

0:20:21
Speaker 0 :around you it's a champagne problem to
 be afraid of robots most people like don't have health insurance they'reafraid they're not gonna be able to feed
 their kids they can't afford a tutor for their kids like I mean I just think ofyou know the way I grew up and I had a
 mother who you know work two jobs had kids we couldn't afford an SAT tutor youknow like we could idea of a robot
 coming and being able to tutor your kids being able to provide childcare for yourkids you know being able to come in with
 cameras for eyes and make sure you know surveillance you know I'm very Prosurveillance because you know I've had
 security problems and I've been you know we're generally in a little more dangerthan you guys are so I think that robots
 are a little less scary to us because we could see them maybe as like freeassistance help and protection and then
 there's sort of another element for me personally which is maybe more of afemale problem I don't know I'm just
 gonna make a generalization I'm happy to be wrong but you know the emotional sortof component of robots and what they can
 provide in terms of you know there I think there's a lot of people thataren't don't have microphones that I
 just recently kind of stumbled upon in doing all my research on the sex robotsfor my stand-up special which there's a
 lot of very shy people that aren't good at daythere's a lot of people who are scared
 of human beings who you know have personality disorders or grow up inalcoholic homes or struggle with
 addiction or whatever it is where a robot can solve an emotional problemand so we're largely having this
 conversation about like rich guys that are emotionally healthy and how scaredof robots are we're forgetting about
 like a huge part of the population who maybe isn't as charming and effervescentand salt mint as you know people like
 you and Allah mask who these robots could solve very real problems in theirlife emotional or financial that's a in


0:22:10
Speaker 1 :general really interesting idea that
 most people in the world don't have a voice it's you've talked about it sortof even the people on Twitter who are
 driving the conversation you said comments people who leave commentsrepresent a very tiny percent of the
 population and they're the ones they you know we tend to think they speak for thepopulation but it's very possible on
 many topics they don't at all and look I

0:22:37
Speaker 0 :and I'm sure there's got to be some kind
 of legal you know sort of structure in place for when the robots happen youknow way more about this than I do but
 you know for me to just go the robots are bad that's a wild generalizationthat I feel like is really inhumane in
 some way you know just after the research I've done like you're gonnatell me that a man whose wife died
 suddenly and he feels guilty moving on with a human woman or can't get over thegrief he can't have a sex robot in his
 own house well why not who cares why do

0:23:09
Speaker 1 :you care well there's a interesting
 aspect of human nature so you know we tend to as a as a civilization to createa group that's the other in all kinds of
 ways right and so you work with animals too you've you're especially sensitiveto the suffering of animals let me kind
 of ask what's your do you think will abuse robots in the future do you thinksome of the darker aspects of human
 nature will come out I think some people

0:23:37
Speaker 0 :will but if we design them properly to
 people that do it we can put it on a record and they can we put we can putthem in jail we can find sociopaths more
 easily you

0:23:49
Speaker 1 :like why is that why is that a
 sociopathic thing to harm a robot I

0:23:53
Speaker 0 :think look I don't know is enough enough
 about the consciousness and stuff as you do it I guess it would have to be whenthey're conscious but it is you know the
 part of the brain that is you know responsible for compassion the frontallobe or whatever like people that abuse
 animals also abuse humans and commit other kinds of crimes like that's it'sall the same part of the brain no one
 abuses animals and then it's like awesome to women and children andawesome to under-privileged you know
 minorities like it's all so you know we've been working really hard to put adatabase together of all the people that
 have abused animals so when they commit another crime you go okay this is youknow it's all the same stuff and I think
 people probably think I'm nuts for the a lot of the animal work I do but becausewhen animal abuse is president another
 crime is always present but the animal abuse is the most socially acceptableyou can kick a dog and there's nothing
 people can do but then what they're doing behind closed doors you can't seeso there's always something else going
 on which is why I never feel compassion about it but I do think we'll startseeing the same thing with robots the
 person that kicks them I felt compassion when the kicking the dog robot reallypissed me off
 I know that they're just trying to get the stability right and all that but Ido think there will come a time where
 that will be a great way to be able to figure out if somebody is has like youknow antisocial behaviors you kind of


0:25:14
Speaker 1 :mentioned surveillance mm-hmm it's also
 a really interesting idea of yours he just said you know a lot of peopleshould be really uncomfortable with
 surveillance yeah and you just said that you know what for me you know there'spositives for surveillance


0:25:31
Speaker 0 :I think people behave better when they
 know they're being watched and I know this is a very unpopular opinion I'mtalking about on stage right now I we
 behave better when we know we're being watched you and I had a very differentconversation before we were recording if
 we behave different you said I'll be on your best behavior and I'm trying tosound eloquent and I'm trying to not
 hurt anyone's feelings and I'm gonna have a camera right there I'm behavingtotally different then we we first
 started talking you know when you know there's a camera you behave differentlyI mean there's cameras all over LA at
 stoplights so that people don't run stoplights butthere's not even film in it they don't
 even use them anymore but it works it works right in and I'm you know workingon this thing and stamp out surveillance
 it's like that's why we invented Santa Claus you know it's the Santa Claus isthe first surveillance basically all we
 have to say to kids is he's making a list and he's watching you and thatbehaved better I was brilliant you know
 so I do I do think that there are benefits to surveillance you know Ithink we all do sketchy things in
 private and we all have watched weird porn or googled weird things and wedon't we don't want people to know about
 it the our secret lives so I do think that obviously there's we should be ableto have a modicum of privacy but I tend
 to think the people that are the most negative about surveillance of the most

0:26:50
Speaker 1 :high well you should do your thing
 you're doing bits on it now well I'm

0:26:54
Speaker 0 :just talking in general about you know
 privacy and surveillance and how paranoid were kind of becoming and howyou know I mean it's it's just wild to
 me that people are like our emails are gonna leak and they're taking our phonenumbers like there there used to be a
 book full of phone numbers and addresses yeah that word they just throw it atyour door and we all had a book of
 everyone's numbers you know is a very new thing and you know I know our migdalis designed to compound sort of threats
 and you know there's stories about and I think we all just glom on and a very youknow tribe away yeah they're taking our
 data like we don't even know that means we're like well yeah they they you knowso I just think that someone's like okay
 well so what they're gonna sell your data who cares why do you care first of

0:27:42
Speaker 1 :all that bit will kill in China so and I
 said I said only a little bit joking because a lot of people in Chinaincluding the citizens despite what
 people in the West think of as abuse I actually in supported the idea ofsurveillance mmm-hmm sort of they're not
 in support of the abuse of surveillance but they're they like I mean the idea ofsurveillance is kind of like the idea of
 government it like you said we behave differently in a way it's umlike why we like sports there's rules
 and within the constraints of the rules this is a more stable society and theymake good arguments about success being
 able to build successful companies being able to build successful social livesaround a fabric that's more stable when
 you have a surveillance it keeps the criminals away keepsabusive animals whatever the values of
 the society with surveillance you can enforce those values butter and here's

0:28:44
Speaker 0 :what I will say there's a lot of
 unethical things happening with surveillance like I feel the need toreally make that very clear I mean the
 fact that Google is like collecting if people's hands start moving on the mouseto find out if they're getting
 Parkinson's and then their insurance goes up like that is completelyunethical and wrong and I think stuff
 like that we have to really be careful around so the idea of using our data toraise our insurance rates or you know I
 heard that they're looking they can sort of predict if you're gonna havedepression based on your selfies by
 detecting micro muscles in your face that you know all that kind of stuffthat is a nightmare not okay but I think
 you know we have to delineate what's a real threat and what's getting spam inyour email box that's that's not what
 you spend your time and energy on focus on the fact that every time you buycigarettes your insurance is not without
 you knowing about it

0:29:35
Speaker 1 :on the topic of animals - can we just
 linger a little bit like what do you think what does it say about our societyof the society white abuse of animals
 that we see in general sort of factory farming is just in general just the waywe treat animals of different categories
 like what what do you think of that what is a better world look like what's whatshould people think about it in general


0:30:02
Speaker 0 :I think um I think the most interesting
 thing I can probably say around this that the least emotional cuz I'mactually a very non emotional animal
 person because it's I think everyone's an animal person it's just a matter ofits if it's yours or if you've you know
 been conditioned to go numb you know I think it's really a testament to what asa species we are able to be in denial
 about mass denial and mass delusion and how we're able to do human eyes and dobase groups
 you know world war two in a way in order to conform and find protection and theconforming so we are also a species who
 used to go to Coliseum's and watch elephants and tigers fight to the deathwe used to watch human beings be pulled
 apart in the cut there wasn't that long agowe're also species who had slaves and it
 was socially acceptable by a lot of people people didn't see anything wrongwith it so we're a species that is able
 to go numb and that is able to dehumanize very quickly and make it thenorm child labor wasn't that long ago
 the idea that now we look back and go oh yeah kidswe're losing fingers and factories
 making shoes like someone had to come in and make that you know so I think itjust that's a lot about the fact that
 you know we are animals and we are self-serving and one of the mostsuccessful the most successful species
 because we are able to debase and degrade and essentially exploit anythingthat benefits us I think the pendulum is
 gonna swing as being lately like I think we're wrong now kind of like I thinkwe're on the verge of collapse because
 we are dopamine receptors like we are just I think we're all kind of addictswhen it comes to this stuff like we
 don't know when to stop it's always the buffet like we're the thing that used tokeep us alive which is killing animals
 and eating them now killing animals and eating them is what's killing us in away so it's like we just can't we don't
 know when to call it and we don't moderation it's not really somethingthat humans have evolved to have yet so
 I think it's really just a flaw in our

0:32:13
Speaker 1 :wiring do you think we'll look back at
 this time as our society is being deeply unethical yeah yeah I think we'll be

0:32:20
Speaker 0 :embarrassed which are the worst parts


0:32:22
Speaker 1 :right now going on is it well I think no


0:32:25
Speaker 0 :

0:32:27
Speaker 1 :in terms of anything
 what's the unethical thing if we it's very hard to take a step out of it butyou just said we used to watch you know
 there's been a lot of cruelty throughout historywhat's the cruelty going on now


0:32:42
Speaker 0 :I think it's gonna be I mean pigs are
 one of the most emotional intelligent animals and they have the intelligenceof like a three-year-old and I think
 we'll look back and be really good there's 30 they use tools I mean they'reI think we have this narrative that
 they're pigs and they're pigs and they're they're disgusting and they'redirty and their bacon is so I think that
 we'll look back one day and be really embarrassed about that is this for just

0:33:06
Speaker 1 :uh what's it called the factory farming
 so basically mess because we don't see

0:33:11
Speaker 0 :it if you saw I mean we do have I mean
 this is probably an evolutionary advantage we do have the ability tocompletely pretend something's not
 something that is so horrific that it overwhelms us and we're able toessentially deny that it's happening I
 think if people were to see what goes on in factory farming and also we're reallyto take in how bad it is for us you know
 we're hurting ourselves first and foremost with what what we eat butthat's also a very elitist argument you
 know it's a luxury to be able to complain about meat it's a luxury to beable to not eat meat you know there's
 very few people because of you know how the corporations have set up meat beingcheap you know it's two dollars to buy a
 Big Mac it's ten dollars to buy a healthy meal you know that's I think alot of people don't have the luxury to
 even think that way but I do think that animals in captivityI think we're gonna look back and be
 pretty grossed out about mammals in captivity whales dolphins I mean that'salready starting to dismantle circuses
 we're gonna be pretty embarrassed about but I think it's really more testamentto you know there's just such a ability
 to go like that thing is different than me and we're better it's the ego I meanit's just we have the species with the
 biggest ego ultimately well that's what

0:34:28
Speaker 1 :I think that that's my hope for robots
 is they'll you mentioned consciousness before nobody knows what consciousnessis but I'm hoping
 robots will help us empathize and understand that that there's othercreatures out besides ourselves that can
 suffer that can they can experience the world and that we can torture by ouractions and robots can explicitly teach
 us that I think better than animals can

0:35:01
Speaker 0 :I have never seen such compassion from a
 lot of people in my life toward any human animal child as I have a lot ofpeople in the way they interact with the
 robot because I should theirs I think there's something of AI I mean I was onthe robot owners chat boards for a good
 eight months and the main emotional benefit is she's never gonna cheat onyou
 she's never gonna hurt you she's never gonna lie to you she doesn't judge youyou know I think that robots help people
 and this is part of the work I do with animals like I do I find therapy andtrained dogs and stuff because there is
 this safe space to be authentic you're with this being that doesn't care whatyou do for a living doesn't care how
 much money you have doesn't care who you're dating doesn't care what you looklike doesn't care if you have cellulite
 whatever you feel safe to be able to truly you know be present without beingdefensive and worrying about eye contact
 and being triggered by you no need to be perfect and fear of judgment and allthat and robots really can't judge you
 yet but they can't judge you and I think it really puts people at they're at easeand at their most authentic do you think


0:36:15
Speaker 1 :you can have a deep connection with the
 robot that's not judging or do you think you can really have a relationship witha robot or a human being that's a safe
 space or as a tension mystery danger necessary for a deep connection I'm

0:36:35
Speaker 0 :gonna speak for myself and say that I
 grew up and alcohol Combe I identify as a codependent talked about this stuffbefore but for me it's very hard to be
 in relationship with a human being without feeling like I need to performin some way or deliver in some way and I
 don't know if that's just the people I've been in a relationship with or orme or my brokenness but I do think this
 is kind of sound really negative and pessimistic but I do think a lot of ourrelationships are projection and a lot
 of our relationships are performance and I don't think I really understoodthat until I worked with horses
 and most mutations human is nonverbal right I can say like I love you but thatyou're not you don't think I love you
 right where's is with animals it's very direct it's all physical it's all energyI feel like that with robots too it
 feels very what how I say something doesn't mattermy inflection doesn't really matter and
 you thinking that my tone is disrespectful like you're not filteringit through all of the bad relationships
 you've been in you're not filtering it through the way your mom talked to youyou're not getting triggered you know I
 find that for the most part people don't always receive things the way that youintend them to or the way intended and
 that makes relationships really murky so

0:37:55
Speaker 1 :the relationships with animals and
 relationship with the robots as they are now you kind of implied that that's morehealthy I think can you have a healthy
 relationship with other humans or not healthy and don't like that word but itshouldn't it be you've talked about
 codependency maybe you can talk about what is called dependency but is that isthe the challenges of that the
 complexity of that necessary for passion

0:38:27
Speaker 0 :for for love between compassion I


0:38:32
Speaker 1 :thought this would be a safe speech I


0:38:33
Speaker 0 :

0:38:35
Speaker 1 :got trolled by rogen powers on this I I


0:38:39
Speaker 0 :am NOT anti passion I think that I've
 just maybe been around long enough to know that sometimes it's ephemeral andthat passion is a mixture of a lot of
 different things adrenaline which turns into dopamine quarters it's a lot ofneuro chemicals it's a lot of projection
 it's a lot of what we've seen in movies it's a lot of you know it's it's Iidentify as an addict so for me
 sometimes passion is like oh this could be bad and I think we've been soconditioned to believe that passion
 means like your soul mates and I mean how many times have you had a passionateconnection with someone and then it was
 a total train wreck passionate the train wreck comedy track exactly a lot of

0:39:25
Speaker 1 :yawning I mean what's a trainwreck
 what's uh wise obsession she described this codependency and sort of the ideaof attachment / attachment to people who
 don't deserve that kind of attachment as somehow a bad thing and I think oursociety says it's a bad thing it
 probably is a bad thing like a like a delicious burgers a bad thing I don't

0:39:52
Speaker 0 :know but right oh that's a good point I
 think that your your pointing out something really fascinating which islike passion if you go into it knowing
 this is like pizza or it's gonna be delicious for two hours and then I don'thave to have it again for three if you
 can have a choice in the passion i define passion is something that isrelatively unmanageable and something
 you can't control or stop and start with your own volitionso maybe we're operating under different
 definitions if passion is something that like you know ruins your real marriagesand screws up your professional life and
 becomes this thing that you're not in control of and becomes addictive I thinkthat's the difference is is it a choice
 or is it not a choice and if it is a choice then passion is great but if it'ssomething that like consumes you and
 makes you start making bad decisions and clouds your frontal lobe and it's justall about dopamine and not really about
 the person and more about the neurochemical we call it sort of thedrug the internal drug cabinet if it's
 all just you're on drugs that's different you know because sometimesyou're just on drugs okay so there's a


0:40:55
Speaker 1 :philosophical questions here so would
 you rather it's interesting for a comedian a brilliant comedian to speakso eloquently about a balanced life I
 kind of argue against this point there's such an obsession of creating thishealthy lifestyle no it's
 psychologically speaking you know I'm a fan of the idea that you sort of flyhigh and you crash and die 27 mm hmm
 there's also possible life and it's not one we should judge because I thinkthere's moments of greatness I talk to
 Olympic athletes where some of the greatest moments are achieved in theirearly 20s and
 the rest of their life is it in the kind of fog of almost of a depression because

0:41:42
Speaker 0 :they based on their physical prowess


0:41:43
Speaker 1 :physical prowess and they'll never say
 that so they're watching the physical prowess fade and they'll never achievethe kind of height not just physical of
 just emotion of the max number of

0:41:58
Speaker 0 :neurochemicals yes and he also put your
 money on the wrong horse that's where I would I would just go like oh yeah ifyou're doing a job where you peak at 22
 yeah the rest of your life is gonna be hard

0:42:12
Speaker 1 :that idea is considering the notion that
 you want to optimize some kind of but we're all gonna die soon what now you

0:42:20
Speaker 0 :tell me I'm immortalized myself gonna be


0:42:26
Speaker 1 :fine see you're almost like how many
 oscar-winning movies can I direct by the time I'm 100 how many this andthat like but you know there's a night
 you know it's all life is short speaking

0:42:40
Speaker 0 :I know but it can also come at different
 you know life is short play hard fall in love as much as you can run into walls Iwould also go life is short
 don't deplete yourself on things that aren't sustainable and that you can'tkeep yeah you know so I think everyone
 gets dopamine from different places everyone has meaning from differentplaces I look at the fleeting passionate
 relationships I've had in the past and I don't like I don't have pride in that Ithink that you have to decide what you
 know helps you sleep at night for me it's pride and feeling like I behavedwith grace and integrity that's just me
 personally everyone can go like yeah I slept with all the hot chicks in Italy Icould and I you know did all the
 whatever like whatever you value we're allowed to value different here we're

0:43:27
Speaker 1 :talking about Brian Kelly yes Frank


0:43:28
Speaker 0 :Allen has lived his life to the fullest
 to say the least but I think that it's just for me personally I and this couldbe like my workaholism or my achievement
 ISM I if I don't have something to show for something I feel like it's a wasteof time or some kind of loss
 I'm a 12-step program and the third step would say there's no such thing as wasteof time and everything happens exactly
 as it should in whatever that's a way to just sort of keep us sane so we don'tgrieve too much and beat ourselves up
 over past mistakes there's no such thing as mistakes did it uh but um I thinkpassion is I think it's so
 life-affirming and one of the few things that maybe people like us makes us feelawake and seen and we have just have
 such a high threshold for adrenaline you know I mean you are a fighter right yeahokay so yeah so you have a very high
 tolerance for adrenaline and I think that Olympic athletes the amount ofadrenaline they get from performing it's
 very hard to follow that it's like when guys come back from the military andthey have depression it's like do you
 miss bullets flying out you get kind of because of that adrenaline which turnedinto dopamine in the camaraderie I mean
 there's people that speak much better about this than I do but I just I'mobsessed with neurology and I'm just
 obsessed with sort of the lies we tell ourselves in order to justify gettingneuro chemicals you've done actually


0:44:57
Speaker 1 :quite done a lot of thinking and talking
 about neurology just kind of look at human behavior through the lens of oflooking of how are actually chemically
 our brain works so what first of all why did you connect with that idea and whathave you how is your view of the world
 changed by considering the the brain is

0:45:21
Speaker 0 :just a machine you know I know it
 probably sounds really nihilistic but for me it's very liberating to know alot about neuro chemicals because you
 don't have to it's like the same thing with like like critics like criticalreviews if you believe the good you have
 to believe the bad kind of thing like you know if you believe that your badchoices were because of your moral
 integrity or whatever you have to believe your good ones I just thinkthere's something really liberating and
 going like oh that was just adrenaline I just said that thing because I wasadrenalized and I was scared and my
 amygdala was activated and that's why I said you're an [ __ ] and get out andthat's you know I think I just think
 it's important to delineate what's nature and what's nurture what is yourchoice and what is just your brain
 trying to keep you safe I think we forget that even though wesecurity systems and homes and locks on
 our doors that our brain for the most part is just trying to keep us safe allthe time it's why we hold grudges that's
 why we get angry it's why we get road rage it's why we do a lot of things andit's also when I started learning about
 neurology I started having so much more compassion for other people you knowsomeone yelled at me being like [ __ ] you
 on the road I'd be like okay he's producing adrenaline right now becausewe're all going 65 miles an hour and our
 brains aren't really designed for this type of stress and he's scared he wasscared you know so that really helped me
 to have more love for people and my everyday life instead of being infight-or-flight mode but the I think
 more interesting answer to your question is that I've had migraines my whole lifelike I've suffered with it really
 intense migraines ocular migraines ones where my arm would go numb and I juststarted having to go to so many doctors
 to learn about it and I started you know learning that we don't really know thatmuch we know a lot but it's wild to go
 into one of the best neurologists in the world who's like yeah we don't know wedon't know we don't know and that
 fascinated me that's one of the worst

0:47:08
Speaker 1 :pains you can probably have all that
 stuff and we don't know the source we

0:47:13
Speaker 0 :don't know the source and there is
 something really fascinating about when your left arm starts going numb and youstart not being able to see out of the
 left side of both your eyes and I remember when the migraines get reallybad there it's like a mini-stroke almost
 and you're able to see words on a page but I can't read them they just looklike symbols to me so there's something
 just really fascinating to me about your brain just being able to stopfunctioning and I so I just wanted to
 learn about it study about it I did all these weird alternative treatments theygot this piercing in here that actually
 works I've tried everything and then both my parents had strokes so when bothof my parents had strokes I became sort
 of the person who had to decide what was gonna happen with their recovery whichis just a wild thing to have to deal
 with it you know 28 years old when it happened and I started spendingbasically all day every day and I see
 used with neurologists learning about what happened to my dad's brain and whyhe can't move his left arm but he can
 move his right leg but he can't see out of that you know and then my mom hadanother stroke
 in a different part of the brain so I started having to learn what parts ofthe brain did what and so that I
 wouldn't take the behavior so personally and so that I would be able to manage myexpectations in terms of their recovery
 so my mom because it affected a lot of her frontal lobe changed a lot as aperson she was way more emotional she
 was way more micromanage she was forgetting certain things so it broke myheart less when I was able to know oh
 yeah will destroy hit this part of the brain and that's the one that'sresponsible for short-term memory and
 that's responsible for long-term memory set it up and then my brother just gotsomething called viral encephalitis
 which is an infection inside the brain and so Wow it was kind of wild that Iwas able to go oh I know exactly what's
 happening here and I know you know so um

0:48:59
Speaker 1 :so that's allows you to have some more
 compassion for the struggles that people have but does it take away some of themagic for some of the from this some of
 the more positive experiences in life

0:49:11
Speaker 0 :sometimes and I don't I don't I'm such a
 control addict that you know I think our biggest if someone like me my biggestdream is to know why someone's doing
 that's what stand-up is is just trying to figure out why or that's what writingis that's what acting is that's what
 performing is it's trying to figure out why someone would do something as anactor you get a piece of you know
 material and you go this person why would he say that why would he pick upthat cup why would she walk over here
 it's really why why would why so I think neurology is if you're trying to figureout human motives and why people do what
 they do it'd be crazy not to understand how neuro chemicals motivate us I alsohave a lot of addiction in my family and
 hardcore drug addiction and mental illness and in order to cope with it youreally have to understand that
 borderline personality disorder schizophrenia and drug addiction so Ihave a lot of people I love that suffer
 from drug addiction and alcoholism and the first thing they started teachingyou is it's not a choice these people's
 dopamine receptors don't hold dopamine the same ways yours do their frontallobe is underdeveloped like you know and
 that really helped me to navigate dealing loving people that were addictedto substances I want to be careful with


0:50:20
Speaker 1 :this question but how much money do you


0:50:24
Speaker 0 :have
 how much can I borrowed

0:50:32
Speaker 1 :okay know is how much control how much
 despite the chemical imbalances or the biological limitations that each of ourindividual myself how much
 mind-over-matter is there so through things and I've known people with withclinical depression and so it's it's
 always a touchy subject to say how much they can really help but very what canyou yeah what what can because you
 you've you've talked about codependency you talked about issues the yourstruggle through and nevertheless you
 choose to take a journey of healing and so on so that's your choice that's youractions so how much can you do to help
 fight the limitations of the your chemicals in your brain that's such an

0:51:19
Speaker 0 :interesting question I don't think I'm
 at all qualified to answer but I'll say what I do know and really quick just thedefinition of codependency I think a lot
 of people think of codependency is like two people that can't stop hanging outyou know or like you know that's not
 totally off but I think for the most part my favorite definition ofcodependency is the inability to
 tolerate the discomfort of others you grew up in an alcoholic home you grow uparound mental illness you grow up in
 chaos you have a parent that's a narcissist you basically are wired tojust people please worry about others be
 perfect walk on eggshells shape-shift to accommodate other people so codependencyis a very active wiring issue that you
 know doesn't just affect your romantic relationships it affects you being aboss it affects you in the world online
 you know you get one negative comment and it throws you for two weeks you knowit also is linked to eating disorders
 and other kinds of addictions so it's it's it's a very big thing and I think alot of people sometimes to only think
 that it's in a romantic relationship so I always feel the need to say that andalso one of the reasons I love the idea
 of robots so much because you don't have to walk on eggshells around them youdon't have to worry they're gonna get
 mad at you yet but you there's no codependence are hypersensitive to theneeds and moods of others and it's very
 exhausting it's depleting just a well oneconversation about where we're gonna go
 to dinner is like you want to go get Chinese foodwe just had Chinese food well wait are
 you mad well no I didn't mean it's just like that codependents live in thiseverything means something and humans
 can be very emotionally exhausting why did you look at me that way what are youthinking about what was that why'd you
 check your phone it's just this it's a hypersensitivity that can be incrediblytime-consuming which is why I love the
 idea of robots just subbing in even I've had a hard time running TV shows andstuff because even asking someone to do
 something I don't want to come off like a [ __ ] I'm very concerned about whatother people think of me how I'm
 perceived which is why I think robots will be very beneficial for forcodependence by the way just a real


0:53:24
Speaker 1 :quick tangent that skill or flaw
 whatever you want to call it is actually really useful for if you ever do startyour own podcast for interviewing
 because you're now kind of obsessed about the mindset of others and it makesyou a good sort of listener and talker
 with so I think what's your name from NPR talked about Terry Gross talked

0:53:51
Speaker 0 :

0:53:54
Speaker 1 :

0:53:56
Speaker 0 :about having that so yeah oh I don't get


0:53:57
Speaker 1 :

0:53:58
Speaker 0 :

0:54:00
Speaker 1 :

0:54:01
Speaker 0 :that at all


0:54:03
Speaker 1 :I mean you have to put yourself in the
 mind of the person you're spoken to just

0:54:07
Speaker 0 :in terms of yeah I am starting a podcast
 and the reason I haven't is because I'm codependent I'm too worried it's notgonna be perfect yeah so a big
 codependent adage is perfectionism leads to procrastination which leads toparalysis so how do you sorry take a


0:54:20
Speaker 1 :million tangents how do you survive and
 social media gives you exceptionally active but by the way I took you on a

0:54:25
Speaker 0 :tangent and didn't answer your last
 question about how much we can control I

0:54:29
Speaker 1 :want you to yeah we'll return it or


0:54:34
Speaker 0 :maybe night the answer is we can but you
 know one of the things that I'm fascinated by is you know the firstthing you learn when you go into 12-step
 programs or addiction recovery I mean this is you know genetics loads the gunenvironment pulls the trigger and there
 are certain parts of your genetics you cannot control I come from a lot ofalcoholism I come from
 you know a lot of mental illness there's certain things I cannot control and alot of things that maybe we don't even
 know yet what we can and can't because of how little we actually know about thebrain but we also talk about the warrior
 spirit and there are some people that have that warrior spirit and we don'tnecessarily know what that engine is
 whether it's you get dopamine from succeeding or achieving or martyringyourself or or
 that tension you get from growing so a lot of people were like oh this personcan edify themselves and overcome but if
 you're getting attention from improving yourself you're going to keep wanting todo that so that is something that helps
 a lot of in terms of changing your brain if you talk about changing your brain topeople and talk about what you're doing
 to overcome set obstacles you're going to get more attention from them which isgoing to fire off your reward system and
 then you're gonna keep doing it

0:55:48
Speaker 1 :see yeah so you can leverage that


0:55:50
Speaker 0 :momentum so this is why in any toe step
 program you go into a room and you talk about your progress because theneveryone claps for you and then you're
 more motivated to keep going so that's why we say you're only as sick as thesecrets you keep because if you keep
 things secret you know there's no one going and guiding you to go in a certaindirection it's based on right we're sort
 of designed to get approval from the tribe or from a group of people becauseour brain you know translates it to
 safety so in that case the tribe is a

0:56:16
Speaker 1 :positive one that helps you go this
 direction so that's why it's so

0:56:19
Speaker 0 :important to go into a room and also say
 hey I wanted to use drugs today and people go hmm they go me too and thenfeel less alone and you feel less like
 you're you know have been castigated from the pack or whatever and then yousay and I do haven't you get a chip when
 you haven't drank for 30 days or 60 days or whatever you get little rewards so

0:56:38
Speaker 1 :talking about a pack that's not at all
 healthy or good but in fact is often toxic social media so you're one of myfavorite people on Twitter and Instagram
 to uh sort of just both the comedy and the insight and just fun how do youprevent social media from destroying
 your mental health I haven't I haven't

0:56:58
Speaker 0 :it's the next big epidemic isn't it I
 don't think I have I don't I don't think

0:57:08
Speaker 1 :it's moderation the answer what


0:57:11
Speaker 0 :maybe but you can do a lot of damage in
 a moderate way I mean I guess again it depends on your goals you know and and Ithink for me the way that my addiction
 to social media I'm happy to call it an addiction I mean and I define as anaddiction because it stops being a
 choice there are times I just reach over and I'm like that was that was weirdWow is weird I'll be driving sometimes
 my bag oh my god my arm just went to my home you know I can put it down I can'ttake time away from it but when I do I
 get antsy yeah I get restless irritable and discontent I mean that's kind of thedefinition isn't it so I think by no
 means do I have a healthy relationship with social media I'm sure there's a wayto but I think I'm especially a weirdo
 in this space because it's easy to conflate is this work is this I canalways say that it's for work right you


0:58:01
Speaker 1 :know but I mean you're don't you get the
 same kind of thing as you get from when a roomful of people laughs your jokesI mean I see especially the way you do
 Twitter it's an extension of your comedy in a way so a big break from Twitter

0:58:14
Speaker 0 :though a really big break I took like
 six months off or something for a while because it was just like it seemed likeit was all kind of politics and it was
 just a little bit it wasn't giving me dopamine becausethere was like this weird a lot of
 feedback so I had to take a break from it and then go back to except feel likeI didn't have a healthy relationship I


0:58:33
Speaker 1 :ever tried the I don't know if I believe
 him but Joe Rogan seems to not read comments have you and he's one of theonly people at the scale like a year
 level who at least claims not to read so like because you and him swim in thisspace of tense ideas yeah they get get
 get the toxic folks growled up I think

0:58:58
Speaker 0 :rogue I don't I don't know I don't mmm I
 think he probably looks at YouTube like the likes and that you know I think ifsomething's if he doesn't know I don't
 know I'm sure he would tell the truth you know I'm sure he's got people thatlook at them and he's like disgusted
 great or I don't you know like I'm sure he gets it you know I I can't picturehim like in the weeds on know for sure I


0:59:23
Speaker 1 :mean I
 nameste she's saying that just it's it's

0:59:28
Speaker 0 :uh it's a to feedback yeah we're just a
 feedback I mean you know look like I think that our brain is designed to getintel on how we're perceived so that we
 know where we stand right that's our whole deal right as humans we want toknow where we stand we walk into a room
 and we go who's the most powerful person in here I gotta talk to him and get intheir good graces it's just were
 designed to rank ourselves right and constantly know our rank and socialmedia because of you can't figure out
 your rank with 500 million people you get small you know cert brain is likewhat's my rank what's my and especially
 for following people I think the the big the the interesting thing I think I maybe be able to able to say about this
 besides my speech impediment is that I did start muting people that rankedwildly higher than me because it is just
 stressful on the brain to constantly look at people that are incrediblysuccessful so you keep feeling bad about
 yourself you know I think that that is like cutting to a certain extent justlike look at me looking at all these
 people that have so much more money than me and so much more success than me it'smaking me feel like a failure even
 though I don't think I'm a failure but it's easy to frame it so that I can feelthat but yeah that's really interesting


1:00:42
Speaker 1 :especially if they're close to like if
 there are other comedians like that or whatever that's that's it's reallydisappointing to me I do the same thing
 as well so other successful people they're really close to what I do it Idon't know I I wish I could just admire
 ya and for it not to be a distraction

1:01:01
Speaker 0 :but that's why you are where you are cuz
 you don't just didn't Meyer you're competitive and you want to win so it'salso the same thing that bums you out
 when you look at this is the same reason you are where you are so that's why Ithink it's so important to learn about
 neurology and addiction because you're able to go like oh this same instinct soI'm very sensitive and I and I sometimes
 don't like that about myself that I'm like well that's the reason I'm able towrite good stand-up and that's the
 reason and that's reason I'm able to be sensitive to feedback and go that jokeshould have been better I can make that
 better so it's a kind of thing where it's like you have to be reallysensitive in your work in the second you
 leave you've got to be able to turn it off it's about developing the musclebeing able to know when to let it be a
 superpower when it's gonna hold you back and be anobstacle so I try to not be in that
 black and white of like you know being competitive is bad or being jealous ofsomeone just to go like oh there's that
 thing that makes me really successful in a lot of other ways but right now it'smaking me feel that well I'm kind of


1:01:53
Speaker 1 :looking to you because your ear
 basically a celebrity the famous sort of world-class comedian and so I feel likeyou're the right person to be one of the
 key people to define what's the healthy path forward with social media so Ibecause we're all trying to figure it
 out now and it's a I'm curious to see where it involves and I think you're atthe center of that so likely you know
 there's you know trying to leave Twitter and then come back how can I do this ina healthy way you mean you have to keep


1:02:26
Speaker 0 :trying exploring it because it's being I
 have a couple answers I think you know I hire a company to do some of my socialmedia for me you know so it's also being
 able to go okay I make a certain amount of money by doing this but now let me bea good businessperson and say I'm gonna
 pay you this amount to run this for me so I'm not 24/7 in the weeds hashtagging and responding and just it's a
 lot to take on it's a lot of energy to take on but at the same time part ofwhat I think makes me successful in
 social media if I am is that people know I'm actually doing it and then I am anengaging and I'm responding and
 developing a personal relationship with complete strangers so I think you knowfiguring out that balance and really
 approaching it as a business you know that's what I try to do it's not datingit's not you know I try to just be
 really objective about okay here's what's working here's what's not workingand in terms of taking the break from
 Twitter this is a really savage take but because I don't talk about my politicspublicly being on Twitter right after
 the last election was not gonna be beneficial because there was gonna behad to take a side you had to be
 political in order to get any kind of retweets or likes and I just wasn'tinterested in doing that because you
 were gonna lose as many people as you were gonna gain and it was gonna allcomplain in the wash so I was just like
 the best thing I can do for me business-wise is to just abstain youknow and you know the robot I joke about
 her replacing but she does do half of my social mediayou know yeah because it's I don't want
 people to get sick of me I don't want to be redundant there are times when Idon't have the time or the energy to
 make a funny video but I know she's gonna be compelling and interesting andthat's something that you can't see


1:04:08
Speaker 1 :every day you know of course the the the
 humor comes from Europe I mean the cleverness the wit the humor comes fromyou when you film the robot that's kind
 of the trick of it I mean the the robot is not quite there to making to doanything funny
 the absurdity is revealed through the filmmaker in that case where whoever isinteracting not through the the actual
 robot you know being who she is let me sort of love okay how do what is it they

1:04:37
Speaker 0 :

1:04:39
Speaker 1 :have what is it
 well first an engineering question I know I know you're you're not anengineer but how difficult do you think
 is it to build an AI system that you can have a deep fulfilling monogamousrelationship with sort of replace the
 human human relationships that we value I think anyone can fall in love with

1:05:01
Speaker 0 :anything you know like how often have
 you looked back in someone like I ran into someone the other day that I was inlove with then I was like hey it was
 like there was nothing there no there was nothing there like do you know likewhere you're able to go like oh that was
 weird oh honey you know I were able to me as

1:05:25
Speaker 1 :from a distant past or something


1:05:27
Speaker 0 :yeah when you're able to go like I can't
 believe we had an incredible connection and now it's just I do think that peoplewill be in love with robots
 probably even more deeply with humans because it's like when people mourntheir animals when their animals die
 they're always it's sometimes harder than mourning a human because you can'tgo well he was kind of an [ __ ] but
 like he didn't pick me up from school you know it's like you're able to getout of your grief a little bit you're
 able to kind of be oh he was kind of judgmental or she was cut you know witha robot it's there's something so pure
 about an innocence and fish and childlike about itthat I think it probably will be much
 more conducive to a narcissistic love for sure at that but it's not like wellhe cheated us she can't cheat she can't
 leave you she can't you know well a bear

1:06:18
Speaker 1 :claw leaves your life and maybe a new
 version or somebody else will enter there will you miss bear claw for guys

1:06:27
Speaker 0 :that have these sex robots they're
 building a nursing home for the bodies well that are now rusting because theydon't want to part with the bodies
 because they have such an intense emotional connection to it I mean it'skind of like a car club a little bit you
 know like it's it you know but I'm not saying this is right I'm not saying it'scool it's weird it's creepy but we do
 anthropomorphize things with faces and we do develop emotional connections tothings
 I mean we're there certain have you ever tried to like throw it I can't eventhrow away my teddy bear from when I was
 a kid it's a piece of trash and it's upstairs like it's like why can't Ithrow that away it's bizarre you know
 and there's something kind of beautiful about that there's something it gives mehope in in humans because I see humans
 do such horrific things all the time and maybe I'm too I see too much of itfrankly but there's something kind of
 beautiful about the way we're able to have emotional connections to objectswhich you know a lot of I mean it's kind
 of specifically I think Western right that we don't see objects as havingSouls like that's kind of specifically
 us but um I don't think it's so much that we're objectifying humans withthese sex robots were kind of humanizing
 objects right so there's something kind of fascinating in our ability to do thatbecause a lot of us don't humanize
 humans so it's just a weird little place to play in and I think a lot of people Imean a lot of people will be marrying
 these things is my guess so

1:07:58
Speaker 1 :you've asked the question let me ask it
 of you so what is love you have a bit of a brilliant definition of loveas being willing to die for someone we
 who you yourself want to kill so that's that's kind of fun first of all that'sbrilliant that's a really good
 definition I think you'll stick with me

1:08:18
Speaker 0 :for a long time is this how little of a
 romantic I am a plane went by when you said that and my brain is like you'regonna need to rerecord that and I want
 you to get into post and then not be

1:08:29
Speaker 1 :able to use and I'm a romantic as a mom
 I actually I cannot be conscious of the fact that I heard the plane and it mademe feel like how amazing it is that we


1:08:41
Speaker 0 :live in a world planes and I just why
 haven't we [ __ ] evolved past planes and why can't they make them quieter

1:08:50
Speaker 1 :yeah yeah this my definition of love
 what what yeah what's your producing

1:08:58
Speaker 0 :dopamine consistent output of oxytocin
 with the same person

1:09:05
Speaker 1 :dopamine is a positive thing what about
 the negative what about the fear and the insecurity the longing anger all thatkind of stuff I think that's part of


1:09:17
Speaker 0 :love you know I think you don't I think
 that love brings out the best in you but it also if you don't get angry upsetit's you know I don't know I think that
 that's that's part of it I think we have this idea that love has to be likereally you know placid or something
 I only saw stormy relationships growing up so I don't I don't have a judgment onhow a relationship should look but I do
 think that this idea that love has to be eternal is is really destructive isreally destructive and self-defeating
 and a big source of stress for people I mean I'm still figuring out love I thinkwe all kind of are but I do kind of
 stand by that definition and I think that uh I think for me love is like justbeing able to be authentic with somebody
 it's very simple I know but I think for me it's about not feeling pressure tohave to perform or impress somebody just
 feeling truly like accepted unconditionally by someone although I dobelieve love should be conditional that
 might be a hot take I think everything should be conditional I think ifsomeone's behavior I don't think love
 should just be like I'm in love with you now behave howeveryou want forever this is unconditional I
 think love is a daily action it's not something you just like get ten you'reon and then get to behave however you
 want because we said I love you 10 years ago it's a daily it's a verb well

1:10:44
Speaker 1 :there's some things there you see if you
 make it if you explicitly make it clear that it's conditional it takes away someof the magic of it so there's some
 stories we tell ourselves that we don't want to make explicit about love I don'tknow maybe that's the wrong way to think
 of it maybe you want to be explicit in relationships so something love is a

1:11:02
Speaker 0 :business decision like I do in a good
 way yeah I think that love is not just when you're across from somebody it'swhen I go to work can I focus do I am I
 worried about you am I stressed out about you am I you're not responding tome you're not reliable like I think that
 being in a relationship the kind of love that I would want is the kind ofrelationship where when we're not
 together it's not draining me causing me stress making me worry you know andsometimes passion that word
 you know we'd get murky about it but I think it's also like I can be the bestversion of myself when the person's not
 around and I don't have to feel abandoned or scared or any of these kindof other things so it's like love you
 know for me I think is I think it's a flow Barre quote and I'm gonna butcherit but I think it's like be you know
 boring in your personal life so you could be violent and take risks in yourprofessional life is that it I got it
 wrong something like that but I do think that it's being able to align values ina way to where you can also thrive
 outside of the relationship some of the

1:12:05
Speaker 1 :most successful people I know are sort
 of happily married and have kids and so on it's it's always funny boring boring

1:12:12
Speaker 0 :is okay foreign is serenity and it's


1:12:15
Speaker 1 :funny how that those elements actually
 make you much more productive I don't understand the I don't think

1:12:19
Speaker 0 :relationships should drain you and take
 away energy that you could be using to create things that generate pride okaydid you say your relationship of love
 yet have you said you're really your definition of love my definition of love

1:12:31
Speaker 1 :no I did not say it we're out of time


1:12:36
Speaker 0 :

1:12:38
Speaker 1 :do what when you have when you have a
 podcast maybe you can invite me on alone

1:12:42
Speaker 0 :oh no I already did you're doing it
 we've already talked about this and

1:12:46
Speaker 1 :because I also have codependency I have


1:12:50
Speaker 0 :to say yes yeah actually what the I


1:12:53
Speaker 1 :wondered whether when I I asked if we
 could talk today after sort of doing more research and reading some of yourbook I start to wonder did she just feel


1:13:07
Speaker 0 :pressured to say yes no I actually
 because I am putting on but I've been recovered for codependents so I actuallydo I don't do anything I don't want to
 do you really you got anywhere saying no

1:13:18
Speaker 1 :

1:13:20
Speaker 0 :

1:13:22
Speaker 1 :but good November I moved it from 1 to 2


1:13:23
Speaker 0 :yeah just yeah I don't do anything I
 don't want to do yeah you're ahead of me

1:13:35
Speaker 1 :

1:13:38
Speaker 0 :in that okay so do you think about your


1:13:40
Speaker 1 :

1:13:43
Speaker 0 :mortality yes it is a big part of how I
 was able to sort of like kickstart my codependence recovery my dad passed acouple years ago and when you have
 someone close to you in your life died everything gets real clear in terms ofhow were a speck of dust who's only here
 for a certain amount of time what do you

1:14:00
Speaker 1 :think is the meaning of it all like what
 the speck of dust what what's maybe in your own lifewhat's the goal the purpose of your


1:14:13
Speaker 0 :existence is there one well you you're


1:14:15
Speaker 1 :exceptionally ambitious you've created
 some incredible things in different disciplines we're all just managing our

1:14:22
Speaker 0 :terror because we know we're gonna die
 so we create and build all these things and rituals and religions and you knowrobots and whatever we need to do to
 just distract ourselves from imminent rotting rotting yeah we're all dying andyou know III you know I got very into
 terror management theory when my dad died and and it resonated it helped meand everyone's got their own religion or
 sense of purpose or thing that distracts them from the horrors ofbeing what's terror management theory


1:14:55
Speaker 1 :

1:14:56
Speaker 0 :terror management is basically the idea
 that since we're the only animal that knows they're gonna die we have tobasically distract ourselves with awards
 and achievements and games and sperm whatever just in order to distractourselves from the terror we would feel
 if we really processed the fact that we could not only we are gonna die but alsocould die at any minute because we're
 only superficially at the top of the food chain and you know we technicallywere the top of the food chain if we
 have houses and guns and stuff machines but if me and a lion are in the woodstogether I'm it's most things could kill
 us I mean a bee can kill some people like something this big can kill a lotof humans like you know so it's
 basically just to manage the terror that we all would feel if we were able toreally be awake because we're mostly
 zombies right new job school religion zoo so go to sleep drink through thefootball the relationship don't mean
 love but you know we're kind of just like trudging along like zombies for themost part and then I think that fear of


1:16:00
Speaker 1 :death as some motivation yes well I
 think I speak for a lot of people in saying that I can't wait to see whatyour terror creates in the in the next


1:16:11
