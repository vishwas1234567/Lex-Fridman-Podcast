Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 commander david fravor who was a navy pilot for 18 years andcommander of the strike fighter squadron
 41 also known as the black aces a squadronof 12 airplanes consisting of several
 hundred people he's also famously one of the people whowith his own eyes
 saw and chased a ufo an identified flying object in 2004that is referred to as the tic tac and
 the incident more formally referred to as the ussnimitz ufo incident
 his story corroborated by several other pilotsfrom my perspective as a curious
 scientist and an open-minded human being is the most credible sighting of a ufoin history
 at least that i'm aware of he's a humble fascinating and fun human being to talkto
 i put out a call for questions on reddit and many other places andtried to ask as many of the questions
 that people posted as i could and overall i really enjoyed thisconversation and i'm sure
 if the world wants us to and if there's more questions to be hadwe'll talk on this podcast again quick

 let me say that the world of ufos and uaps unidentified aerial phenomena andaliens in general
 is foreign to me because of the high ratio of outlandish conspiracy theoriststo actual hard evidence i'm a scientist
 first and foremost but an open-minded one often looking andthinking outside the box
 i'm often disheartened by the closed-mindedness of the scientificcommunity
 and in equal part i'm disheartened by the lack of rigor and basic scientificinquiry and study on the part of the
 conspiracy theorists i believe there's a line somewherebetween the two extremes that
 more inquisitive minds should walk i think we humans know very little aboutour world
 what's up there among the stars and the nature of realityand the nature of our very own minds
 the path to understanding can only be walked humblythe very idea that there is a
 possibility that david witnessed a piece of technologywhether human made or alien made that
 moved in the way it did should be inspiring to every scientistand engineer on this earth
 there may be propulsion and energy systems yet to be discovered thatonce understood and mastered will put
 distant galaxies within reach of us human beings paradigmshifts in science and
 leaps and understanding can only happen i think if we open our eyesand allow ourselves to dream to think
 from first principles and remove the constraints andinnovation placed on us by the
 scientific conventions and assumptions ofprior generations if you enjoy this

 fasting of 16 hours and then an eight hour eating period of two mealssometimes 24 hours
 that's one dinner to the next i've been even considering doing a 48 or 72 hourfast that some people i look up to have
 done people who have done it tell me that outside of weight loss andthe different health benefits
 it's a chance to meditate on the finiteness of lifenot eating somehow is a reminder that
 we're immortal that every day is precious i certainlyexperienced this with the 24-hour fast
 and i think it goes even deeper for the 48 72 and evenweek-long fasts anyway i always break my

 with david fraver you're a graduate of thenavy fighter weapons school yeah i am
 better known as top gun so yeah let me let me ask the most ridiculous questionhow realistic is the movie top gun


0:07:25
Speaker 0 :so it's funny we used to joke and a
 friend of mine who was a top cut instructoruh said this there's two things in the
 in the original top gun that are true that are very realistic one there is aplace called top gun
 and number two is they do fly airplanes thereother than that uh you know i went
 through in 97 uh class 497 and there's actually a logof every single person that's went
 through kind of like seal training you know there's a list sopeople because there's a lot of posers
 out there i was a navy seal no you weren't well i went to top gun you couldactually go to top gun and matter of
 fact just to get a top gun patch the realpatch
 uh you have to have gone there so a lot of the patches you seerunning around are not real there's the
 real ones are controlled the people that make them uh honor thatand when you go in they look up your
 name if you want to get one they look up yourname you just tell them they go okay
 here and i'll sell them to you if you are not on the listyou ain't get no patch because it is
 it's it's it's a pretty big deal to go through but it's for me uhprobably the best experiences of flying
 uh because everyone there is extremely competent it's it'svery very challenging but it's what we
 all signed up to do so it's uh it's just the entire groupthat is when you want to be that you
 know that level uh you know where you go everyone reallycares and everyone really wants to be


0:08:52
Speaker 1 :good
 is it competitive like what was it in the movie or no

0:08:55
Speaker 0 :it's when you go through it's you know
 it's if anything it's more of the studentsyou know and then there's the instructor
 side and the instructor sides are really youknow they're guys that you know
 they just chose to stay up and fallon and it's extremelyuh difficult job uh because they have
 they have a very small tolerance for um not being good so they're briefs theguys when they give a lecture so
 let's just say there's a fighter employment lecture which is one of thehardest ones it takes about two days to
 give the fighter employment lecture um the guy who gives the lecture goesthrough multiple what they call a murder
 boards where he's scrutinized by his peers and he practicesby the time they actually stand in front
 of a class they pretty much have their 250powerpoint slides memorized
 and they don't even turn around they just click and they know them in orderand they repeat the same thing over it's
 and it's standardized so they are extremely extremelystandardized when you go through school
 and there's a reason for that because what they're doing is they'retraining so when you come out a top gun
 you're called a strike fighter weapons and tactics instructorokay so your sfti when you come out of
 that your job is to go usually to one of theweapons schools on the east or west
 coast and train the fleet squadrons and then youvisit the squadrons and train and do
 upgrade rides and all that so there's a there's a reason that they areextremely
 particular when you go through the course it's it is literally one of thebest things and it's not it's not a rank
 based thing because think oh navy you can come in as a you know like a ano4 lieutenant commander
 the lieutenants the hierarchy or at least to be i don't know how it isexactly today but i imagine it's the
 same the hierarchy is actually based onseniority at the school not necessarily
 ranked so when the the tactical decisions are made whichare based on fact and
 and trying things out in the fallon rangesuh they set this the top x number of
 folks that have been there seniority wiseis and i mean time wise uh are the ones
 that actually make the decision and when the dooryou may not agree but when the door
 opens and everyone comes out from the staff they all speak the samelanguage
 it's and it has to be that way which is why the school has been so effectivesince it was founded
 so it's just a it's an incredible group

0:11:13
Speaker 1 :of individuals so
 there's a bar of excellence that uh that the instructors demand well very

0:11:19
Speaker 0 :much so and they're held to it
 so it's not a hey i'm now an instructor so i can do what i wantthere is a standard and they have to
 live up to that standard they have to and i mean every moment ofevery day
 uh so if they go someplace if they go from fallon and they come down and dothey're called site visits where they
 come down and they'll come to la moore california which is where the west coastfighter wing is at for the navy
 and they go around and start flying sorties with the fleet squadronsto kind of pass on some of that
 knowledge that's that same high level of standard it's they can't just drop yourguard
 because you wear the top gun patch and people know that and they wear lightblue shirts so it's pretty easy to
 identify them when they're out there and you know and then everyone elsewho's been through the school including
 them have the patch on their sleeve so there's a standard that's expectedwhen you come out of there


0:12:06
Speaker 1 :so you're a navy pilot for 18 years yes
 can you briefly tell the story of your career

0:12:14
Speaker 0 :as a pilot yeah um so
 you know first i was in i was enlisted i was a marineand then the marines actually sent me
 recommended me to go to the naval academy uh so it's always better to belucky than good but i got to go to naval
 academy and i finished and i've had that dream to flyso when i got selected


0:12:33
Speaker 1 :

0:12:35
Speaker 0 :they've always dreamed of flying yeah
 since 1969 when i watched neil armstrong walkon the moon
 um i was at that point i asked my mom i remember watching it i wasi was just prior to being five and i
 said wow yeah it's so cool mom and she saidwell you know they were all pilots
 and uh then at that point it was like i'm gonna be a pilot andif you knew me growing up because i was
 a little bit of a delinquent um people are just like yeah right i usedto joke i'm gonna fly
 i'm gonna fly jets and i'm gonna drop bombs then and ifpeople that knew me was a kid they'd be
 like yeah and they'd be like not a chance and thenwhen i did i actually had a funny story
 and i'll get to it and i'll finish my career buti was at my cousin's wedding and uh we
 all grew up in the same neighborhood uh we kind of that italian sideof the family that's how we grew up so
 it was my house right down the street is my cousin chad and right around thecorner with my cousin ray and my aunts
 and uncles and stuff the guy two doors down from my and i wasa paper boy in the neighborhoods they
 all knew me and uh i went to my cousin's wedding andhe and mr race looks at me and he says
 david fravor i go mr race how are you doing you guysyou fly jets top gun and all that i go
 yes sir i guess i figured he'd be in jail by nowum
 it was kind of a to me it was a little bit of a badge of honor going on youknow i kind of overcame that but


0:13:55
Speaker 1 :uh what do you attribute that to so you
 i've heard you before and just now i'll say that uh it's better beit's better to be lucky than good and
 you you talk modestly about uh about just being luckybut if you were to describe your
 trajectory maybe in a way of advice likeretrospectively
 uh how did you pull it off to be like to be truly a special person the easiest

0:14:22
Speaker 0 :way is one
 never never take no don't let anyone put you down and say you can't do it orthose i mean i knew
 i knew what i was capable of inside you know and if ireally believe if you want something and
 you want to do something then you you can achieve it not in all cases likeif i loved basketball and i really
 wanted to be in the nba there's a realism that says i'm fivefoot eight and i got like a really short
 vertical leap but i'm really not that good at basketball it's probably notever going to happen no matter how hard
 i try and practice it's just the way it is or for me to bein the nfl
 i'm not fast you know i'm not that big it's just physically i'm incapable ofdoing that
 um but there's things that don't really tie toa true physical ability as far as size
 and strength but it's it's mental uh and i'm not sayingyou have to be a genius and super smart
 to be a fighter pilot matter of fact you don'tit really comes down to the ability to
 think very quickly uh 80 solution is typically good enoughbecause if you overthink it
 you're you're behind and then in an air-to-air fight that's what happenspeople try and overthink it
 and before you know it because it's happening so fast you don't haveyou can't get to the nth degree you know
 six decimal places eighty percent solution is good enough

0:15:37
Speaker 1 :you build up a really strong gut for the
 80

0:15:40
Speaker 0 :solution just yeah i'm a big believer in
 80 percent solution i love that if you get 80 percentyou can go and then you can always
 adjust which is exactly what like if you're fighting in bfmthe 80 solution is it's like a chess
 game but it's a really really fast chess game where you goi'm doing this and then i know that if i
 do a maneuver if he's going to counter it correctly heshould do a
 if he doesn't do a he does some degree less like bc d and then i know how bad his his
 error is and then i capitalize so my might idon't have to be perfect you know i have
 to go i need to go to 47 degrees nose highif i just kind of get above 40 then i'm
 good and i can watch how he reacts and then i can adjust for that and youand you continually work that problem
 and you chip away because if you start neutralyou're just basically chipping away and
 gaining advantage advantage advantage till eventuallyyou know and if you're really you know
 fighting you know just guns only rear quarter where you got to get behind theguy
 kind of world war ii dogfighting type stuff umthen it's it's literally it's a it's a
 very very fast chess game that happens at you know 400knots 300 knots depends


0:16:45
Speaker 1 :so to get to be one of the rare
 individuals that uh are able to do that he just had thedream
 and didn't take no for an answer well

0:16:55
Speaker 0 :you know
 you know part of it is family you know uhmy dad was uh i used to call him a fire
 ready aim guy you know he'd smack me and then ask mewhat i did wrong yeah
 good parenting um back then you know i i joke and and people look because youknow at times it was kind of tough you
 know because he can be pretty demanding but on theother side you know i probably needed to
 be reined in a little bit at times uh butthen everyone else my family you know my
 mom was really awesome when i was a kid uh my uh my grandfather who is a bigbig part of it my mom's dad uh
 who he taught me a lot and you have a question there that we'll talk aboutuh about him but uh huge huge influence
 very very positive and a lot of the stuff that i do todayand decisions are based on things that
 he taught me um and uh you know and i figuredyou know it was the first funeral i ever
 went to and it was uh it was about three miles long and churchwas overfilling and people were out he
 was a beer delivery guy dead serious and you go there someoneasked who died the pope


0:18:03
Speaker 1 :um so a lot of people love them so back


0:18:04
Speaker 0 :to
 back to my career yeah the first question because i'm getting down onrabbit hole uh
 no i when i was at the i was gonna i was gonna stay in the marines i reallywanted to go
 man i love the core i think it's uh of all services it's that one everything isin a ball and they're very very
 professional and it was a great great organization to joinuh but i went out to the nimitz on my uh
 freshman cruise after your freshman year at the naval academy you go out on aship
 and you you're an enlisted person you get to experience that half when ialready was enlisted so it's fine with


0:18:35
Speaker 1 :me
 because it comes up a lot would you mind saying what the nimitz is what a ship is

0:18:40
Speaker 0 :like yeah so nimitz is uh an aircraft
 carrier so it's uh four and a half acres of sovereignu.s territory that floats around the u.s


0:18:48
Speaker 1 :oceans does it have weapons on it


0:18:50
Speaker 0 :uh the air wing is really the weapons it
 does have defensive weapons but for the most part it's a giantmoving airport is what it is so i was
 out there watching the airplanes land and take offand i'm like oh and the squadrons that
 were out there one of the squadrons was a vf-41 and a 14 squadronvf-84 an f-14 squadron and then a couple
 of a6 squadrons and we actually ended up part pairing upand hanging out with some of the a6
 pilots and bn's so it was really a neat experience and i saidi want to do that and the way to do it
 was to not to to go in the navy because there aremarine squadrons that go out to the
 aircraft carriers but most of them are land-based you know tosupport the marines because they're
 that that unit that whole unit you know the marine corps is that one service hasit all
 and so when i graduated and i got to uh you know i worked hard throughprimary and that's where
 you know i knew missy uh we were actually went through together missycummings
 uh we went through primary together and then uh i went to kings we all selectedthe same time i went to kingsville there
 was another guy scott wiedemeyer uh the three of us so i went tokingsville
 scott went to beeville and missy went to meridianso the three of us that we had all went
 through we got we selected out of primary together we all ended up goingjets
 and that's that's how besides from school i knew her at school toothe long story i got done uh got winged
 it took me two years to the day from the time i graduated the naval academy untili got my wings
 and uh through some luck i ended up getting asics'son the west coast which is a
 side-by-side bomber so it's a pilot on the left seat and the bombardiernavigators on the right seat it was
 built in the 60s it is all weather and it flies low atnight it's got a terrain mapping radar


0:20:32
Speaker 1 :how many i guess is that a good term to
 use fighter jets as a broad category for for the public yeah that's probably howmany fighter jets are side by side like


0:20:42
Speaker 0 :that
 that was uh in the navy that was the only one theair force the f-111 was a side-by-side
 but the navy it was the a6 and then there's the ea6b which is a derivativeof
 that and now that those are all gone the a6b's just went away a few years ago andnow the
 e18g growler is the replacement for the a6bthere was never a replacement for the a6
 that i flew it really became the f-18 which the a6could
 go quite a bit further distance wise by fuelthan the hornet and uh the horn is the


0:21:13
Speaker 1 :f-18 yeah is there usually two people
 in the plane but they're usually like in front and behind

0:21:20
Speaker 0 :in a the modern two-seaters yes uh but
 most of the tactical airplanes in the world today are single seat

0:21:25
Speaker 1 :so you can see just one person one


0:21:27
Speaker 0 :person with the exception of
 i'll probably someone will yell at me but really with the exception of thef-15e strike eagle
 and the f-18f super hornet which is the f is a two-seaterand the g is also a two-seater but it's
 more of an electronic attack by say

0:21:43
Speaker 1 :full-up fighter bomber so most of the
 time that you've flown in your like i said 18-year career

0:21:51
Speaker 0 :is was it two-seater i was about half
 and half so i started off an a6 was a two-seaterthen i went to single-seat f-18s and i
 flew those all the way up until 2000 andlet me think 2001 to the end of 2001
 and then i shifted over and started flying the super hornets and i've flownboth of those the ease and the s but i
 deployed when i had command of vfa41 i had the two seat they were f squadron

0:22:17
Speaker 1 :so you
 eventually ended up commanding the the strike fighter squadroni love the the name the black aces what
 uh is there some parts of thatjourney that are amazing parts of it
 that are tough that kind of stand out

0:22:36
Speaker 0 :to me it was one it was a huge honor uh
 and i got to serve with uh you know i got pulled up because the the guy whothe the people that are exos because we
 fleet up you go from the number two guy to the number one guyso the exo becomes the ceo so the
 executive officer becomes the commanding officerso i had worked with uh now
 soon to be vice admiral weitzel uh was thehe was commander whitefield at the time
 was the exo and he really wanted because he knew there wasa little bit of a problem when the super
 hornets came into lamore lamore had been a single seat fightercommunity
 since the forever and now all of a sudden you've got the f-18f coming inwhich has the weapon systems operators
 in the back that are not pilots they're weaponsystems operators and there's a
 difference and kenny is a weapon systems operatorand uh
 kenny knew because of my a6 background that i have a switch that i can go oneseat 2c1 c2c because when you fly 2c
 there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload andtake the advantage of the weapon systems
 operator and it's not that one plus one equals two in that environment becauseit really
 there's a huge amount of capabilities that the single seat has and theautonomy that
 comes for the ability to make decisions quickly and how well the airplane fliesbut it does it does equal more than one
 and i would say that one plus one with two people aswell as a minimum of 1.5
 because you've got an extra head you've got extra eyes you've got someone thatcan monitor systems the airplanes can do
 two things at once i mean there's an incredible amount of capability that weadd when we do that


0:24:14
Speaker 1 :can we just pause on that just for me
 from like a human factors perspective and also anai perspective what's
 how difficult uh so there's like when there's two peoplethere's also a third person that's the
 ai part there's some level of automation like autopilot maybethat's correct maybe you can kind of
 talk about the psychology of like you said making decisions really quick80
 how do you deal with another brain working with youand then also the automation is there
 interesting interplay that you get to learn and alsoas that change throughout your career i
 imagine it got gotten better in terms of the automationor perhaps not


0:24:59
Speaker 0 :well i can tell you so that let's say
 there's a bunch of stars this is no this is this is good this is goodand this is i'm enjoying this because
 now we actually get to talk about something other than a tic tac soum so let's start with the a6 the a6 was
 really an analog airplane that was built in the60s
 all right and there's been studies done on the crew coordination which is theinteraction between the pilot and the
 bombardier navigator so we would fly low at night in themountains so
 i was stationed up in whidbey island washington so you've got the cascadesand
 incredible uh amount of time and we would get in the simulators becauseunlike
 normally people think terrain following and there's the radars the 111 the b1has a system like this but it'll
 the radar can see and it'll fly it basically flies a straight line so itgoes up and over mountains and back down
 and up and over mountains where the a6 was really manual so you do thislow-level routes where you're gonna
 you're gonna fly in the mountains at night you're gonna be atyou know 500 to 1000 feet above the
 ground ripping through like fog layers because you don't needto see outside you're
 you're literally flying a little tv

0:26:02
Speaker 1 :screen and a radar what are you looking
 at most of the time so you just as a

0:26:05
Speaker 0 :screen it's this really
 primitive if you look at it now what we did you'd think wow that was crazybut it was really fun so is it similar


0:26:11
Speaker 1 :to like the flair stuff
 is that is no are you is it this thing

0:26:15
Speaker 0 :is totally radar based now the airplane
 had a flear ball it's a target recognition andmulti-sensor it's called a tram


0:26:23
Speaker 1 :um you're looking at like basically like
 dots of hard objects no actually what it

0:26:27
Speaker 0 :is is the
 the bombardier navigator had a radar and he was getting raw feed off of a pulseradar in front
 okay so it's just basically mapping the mountain so if you look at a mountain ona radar and you're coming up on it
 the front side is going to be it's going to give you a really bright return andon the back side it's just going to be a
 giant shadow because you can't see on the other sideso the bomb of your navigators would do
 that and we they would have charts and they couldshade their charts knowing that hey if
 we turn a little bit left here we can get in this valley we can sneak up thisvalley and then go around the back side
 of the mountain which is what the airplane would do and

0:26:58
Speaker 1 :so and sorry to interrupt
 i'm going to just keep asking dumb questions i apologize butthe pilot can you can you at a high
 level say what the pilot does versus the bombbombardier uh
 so you're you're actually just control

0:27:12
Speaker 0 :i'm flying the jet i have the throttles
 the stick and i have a uh it's about a probably afour inch or six inch wide by maybe
 four inches five inches high it looks like it's literally a crtthat's how old it is a crt screen and
 what it would do what the radar would do isthe the the bombardier navigator is
 looking at his radar and he's looking out about 12 and a half miles in frontof the airplane
 so he has the range really scoped down because the radar can see a lot furtherhe's looking at about 12 and a half
 miles when we're in the terrain mode where we're dodging mountains and stuffand what the pilot has is there's
 they're called range bins and there's eight of themso the very far range bin is the 12 and
 a half mile you know and the closest range been it'sa thing and it'll be like between like a
 half a mile and or a quarter mile to three quartersof a mile the next one might be three
 quarters of a mile to two miles and then it just keeps going out likethat so if there's a mountain for let's
 say we're on a flat plain and there's a mountain out in thedistance at 15 miles and we we're just
 driving right at it so when we get to the point where ithits 12 and a half miles where the radar
 is going to see it on his scope my 12th my range bin for that would popup and it would show like a big bump
 like a mountain and then as i got closer to it the nextarrangement would pop up and show it
 and i could see that that bump was moving towards me and then if i turned alittle bit
 you know to go over here i'd see the mountain go over to the right hand sideand i could do that but it wasn't like a
 video game it was it's literally like if you think of the original ataris yeah

0:28:44
Speaker 1 :but you build up i imagine
 that you start to get uh a really deep senseof like the actual three 3d environment
 based on that little atari's it's solid

0:28:55
Speaker 0 :you're exactly right and you have to
 you have to train so there's been studies a matter of fact a lot of thebasis
 and people probably argue with me but it's true there were studies donewatching asics crews in our simulators
 we called it the wist the weapon systems trainer and it wasnot even a motion it just kind of sat
 there and you just you could fly these things theyhad terrain that they would inject into
 the system uh but the crew coordination so you getso my first
 uh my first fleet bombardier navigator who whoi'll name him his name's crusado uh he's
 uh works at apple uh pretty high up bro mitgrad
 i think computer engineering he's scary smartso chris could really work and matter of
 fact all the guys that flew us so there's another guy matt who also workedat apple who's now at sap we did our
 first night traps together the bond between us i mean it's one ofthose things that you just you're never
 going to forget but chris and i when we started flying together we were actuallythe most junior crew
 in the squadron uh we'd spent a lot of timetraining and and and chris was amazing
 at how he could work the system uh one because he was extremelybrilliant and he was
 had that inquisitive mind of oh we could do all these different things andthere's all these
 degradation modes but we spent a lot of timeto see how good we could actually get
 because and it's you almost talk in partial so as the bnis looking at his radar scope
 chris would say i've got rising terrain that's just what they sayshowing rising terrain at 12 miles and
 i'd see the little bump and i'd say got it this is going to go to yourquestion on the autonomy and how you
 work with two heads yes so when you first get together theinteraction it's
 it's it's almost like you have to rehearse it you have to knowand you talk in full senses the more and
 more we fly together chris could goi'm showing and he'd get like rising out
 and before he finished i'd say i've got itso you end up starting to talk in
 partials because i have to trust him likei mean there can be no i can have no
 doubt that he knows how to do his job because i'm literally looking at thislittle scope that's not giving me this
 continuous picture of that mountain moving remember the mountain's hereand then it's going to pop up here and
 then it's going to pop up here because there's gaps in the coverage on how thesystem was set up remember it's an
 analog system to where he is telling me like i can'tsee all the way to the left and he
 he's got a wider scope on the radar but my screen doesn't show thatso he's telling me start a left turn how
 to avoid a hard turn you know and we would do that so my

0:31:31
Speaker 1 :channel this is all happening quick


0:31:32
Speaker 0 :very quick well you're doing we we would
 typically fly between 420 and 480 knots of ground 70 miles an hour uh well 427miles a minute
 okay or eight months between seven and eight miles a minute is what you'reflying as fast
 at night i mean i broke out of clouds i mean i remember him and i flyingwe're on it's the ir it's called an ir
 route uh an instrument route that's low they're allaround the country there's ir344 that we
 used to fly which would coast in off of or you'd fly from the land you go outover the ocean turn around and then you
 could practice actually coming in on a coastlineand we were flying and we ended up in
 the clouds keep in mind we're between 500 and 1000feet in the mountains and we're in the
 clouds like you can't see anything and it had toturn off our red lights that flash you
 know they're called the anti-collision lightsbecause it was reflecting off the clouds
 and it starts to bother you just gets annoyingso i turned it off and we we're flying
 we're flying we're flying we break out of that coastal marine layerand poof we break out and it's it's a
 decent night and this is right by mount sthelens this is kind of where we're
 coming in so we're coming in from the east and we're just north of mount sthelens is where the route goes
 and you look up you know because you can kind of see the silhouette of thismountain that's right next to you but
 you're flying along you're just like you know you gotta trustand you can see houses you can see the
 lights they're above you we're literally below people's houses flying down thesevalleys and stuff so just
 incredible experience so when you take that and then you move intoan f-18f so now we're into modern
 technology that was actually built in this centuryuh uh and you're flying so now you know
 the wizzo is behind us and we're not doing those night low levels but thatsame type of crew coordination
 that has to happen because what you're doing isyou're sharing the load so most of the
 communications that go out of the airplane the wizzo does all the talk andhe's got actually he uses
 the feet that's the weapon systems operator in the back of an f-18fso he's going to run well the radar kind
 of runs itself now but we have a situational awarenessdisplay and it's it's linked to all the


0:33:29
Speaker 1 :other errors just like curiosity what's
 the situational awareness display because that term comes up a lot think

0:33:33
Speaker 0 :of it as uh think of it as a god's eye
 view so if you have a the back of the superhornet has well the block twos has about
 an eight by ten display for the wizzos um that they can look at the pilots issmaller it's down between us it's a six
 by six between his legs and they're they're getting ready to redesign thatboeing is but
 when you look it'd be like if you put your airplane and you're looking down soall the stuff like if your radar seeing
 bad guys out in front of you be like looking down going oh i'm right here andnow there's bad guys out here
 and my wingman is over here and it shows everything it's just likeit gives you you can look at that
 display and go oh okay i can see where everything's at i cansee if one guy's trying to target
 another guy it shows you all this it's an incredibleamount of knowledge that comes up
 for the crews to maintain uh the the overall picture of what's goingon big picture sense of what's going on
 because it's happening so fast and this is with that autonomy piecethis is the third brain so we're all
 looking at it and the third brain is doing fusionit's pulling stuff together going oh
 this is all this guy this is this guy this this guy it's sending it outthrough the link so all the airplanes
 are talking to each other through this digital networkyou know that we don't even see it just
 says that airplane says hey i'm over here and it tells us and we go oh he'sright there
 and then we can go he's his airplane says oh i'm looking at this airplanethis bad guy and it shows us oh he's
 he's over there and he's looking at this guy i mean it's an incredibleamount of uh visual intake because your
 eye you can hear a lot but when you lookdown at stuff it's uh you know you can


0:34:59
Speaker 1 :solve the picture
 really quick the third brain is doing thesensor fusion uh the integration of the
 different sensors and gives you a big picture viewwhat about the control like is there and
 i apologize as if this is a dumb question but youknow people use the high level term
 of autopilot how much is there let's use a loose term of ai how muchautomation is there how much ai is there
 in helping you control there um the ai

0:35:26
Speaker 0 :piece would be more of a control loop
 because the digital flight controls so the airplane actuallythey had to make the airplane easier to
 fly and when i say easy it's relative because people go i could do it becausei did it on flight sim
 it's real life is a lot different in flight sim you have no apparent fear ofdeath
 you'll do things in simulator that you would never do in real life butuh the the autonomy in the airplane to
 allow you to manage i mean because you think about it you'vegot a radar that's feeding you data
 you've got a targeting pod that's feeding you data all that stuff ishooked to your head
 because you've got a joint helmet mounted queuing system on that basicallymaps the magnetic field in the cockpit
 so it can tell where your heads at lookingso if i turn my head to the right the
 radar will actually look to the right the targeting flare will look to theright
 and oh by the way the backseater has a helmet on too so he can look to the leftand he can do things so depending on
 what sensor he's controlling so if he's got control of the targetingpod and he looks left the targeting pod
 looks left but if i have something where iwant to lock a guy up that i don't see
 that maybe the radar didn't see but i can get over and now point the radar youknow get the
 because it's a it's a phase array radar now it doesn't really scanuh there's there's all kinds of cool
 stuff that uh that technology uh brings because if youjust if you went back 30 years and said
 hey or 40 years ago and said hey we're gonnahave this helmet and you're gonna be
 able to slew everything to your head and i don't mean a mechanical setup buti mean literally you're just gonna map
 magnetic resonance and go oh look and then i can i can literally slew mysensors this fast
 and then mash a button and transfer you knowhigh quality coordinates from a system
 into a joint you know a jdam which is a joint directattack munition that is the gps bombs
 that you see all the time and then let that thing fly and i'm i'msolving this problem
 in seconds by minutes or hey i got it we're gonna have to menstruatecoordinates and
 you know you bring back the data and then they do all the targeting for itand then they send another group out to
 get it instead of all that now it's that fast

0:37:23
Speaker 1 :so there's a
 okay i mean we probably don't have enough time to talk about the beautifulfusion of mines that happens when two
 people are flying controlling the plane but at a highlevel this is a really
 interesting question for people who don't know what they're talking aboutlike me
 which is what is the difference between a human beingand an ai system like
 what can what is the ceiling of a currentai technology for controlling the plane
 like how much does the human contribute uh is itpossible to have
 automated flight for example like what isthe hardest part about flying
 that a human does expertly that an ai system cannotin warfare situations in in


0:38:14
Speaker 0 :flying a fighter jet lane so i would say
 systems are usually black and white when you write the algorithm for an ai systemit's it's it's it's really it's
 basically you're taking thought and turning it into a giant mathproblem is really what you're doing
 right so you've got this logical math problem math problems arethere's there's there's a line it says i
 can or i can't and it's a it's a very finite lineyou know but you can go up to the line
 where a human we all have gray areas where we gomaybe yeah i'll try it um so he just can


0:38:47
Speaker 1 :operate within that gray so if you took


0:38:50
Speaker 0 :if you take an airplane and say and i'll
 just take a hornet for a while a super horn it doesn't matter any airplaneand you go here is the flight
 performance model of the airplane so if you know an uh an em diagram is theenergy so it basically says
 the airplane can fly as slow as this it can go as fast as this it can pull thismany
 g's force of gravity you know so one two three four five six sevenand then based on the airfoil design and
 everything else and how it can pull here's how it's going to fly you knowbecause it's really physics based
 well if you depending on how you write the ai but typically ai you don't wantthe airplane to leave controlled flight
 right you want to maintain it so that it is flying in a controlled envelopeor there are times and you can go back
 to world war one where people intentionally departed theairplane from controlled flight
 in order to obtain an advantage which is that's where the humangoes can i do this i know it's outside
 of where i would normally go but i can do that so you can do somecrazy things now especially since the
 flight control logic in modern airplanes with digital flightcontrols
 they're extremely forgiving so you can literally i've done things in superhornets that
 literally even as a pilot inside the airplane you're just like wow i cannotbelieve it just did that
 like it'll flop ends which defies most logic and i guessyou know in a way you could probably
 program it but i still think that when you get to the edgesthat may or may not give you an
 advantage um there are things that a human can willdo
 that ai won't and i don't think we've got to the point becausehow do you how do you map illogical
 solutions you know most ai is logical it's basedon some type of premise when you write
 the algorithm to control it um there's bounds yeah there's this

0:40:37
Speaker 1 :giant mess like you said the difference
 between the simulator and real life also gets atthat somehow that there is uh
 somehow the the fear of death all of thatbeautiful mess comes into play like is
 there a comment you can make on commercialflight
 like with sully landing uh that plane famously uh versus thesimulator all of those discussions is
 there some

0:41:04
Speaker 0 :well it's it's very it's very similar
 what i was talking about earlier with the a6 soone is when you're flying with a crew uh
 their standardization so you gotta remember when sully flewwhen his first officer that's the
 co-pilot showed up you know first time they metand this happens all the time in the
 commercial world you know there's six seven thousand pilots at unitedairlines you know your chance of flying
 with the same guy all the time is slim and none we're in the navywe were crude so i had a primary and a
 secondary wizzo that flew with me

0:41:32
Speaker 1 :for a while for months oh hell yeah for


0:41:34
Speaker 0 :like all of the deployment
 so because you want to use you have to

0:41:38
Speaker 1 :trust


0:41:41
Speaker 0 :all of those things it increases the
 capability airplane it's not to say we can't swapout but for true effectiveness
 especially in very complex missions like aforward air controller we're in the air
 actually controlling ground assets and supporting ground troopsif you're in a high threat area which is
 crazy busy you have to you have to be melded whenyou do that you have to have trained to
 do that job otherwise you're going to be ineffectiveso when you get to the commercial world
 and i've got tons of friends at fly commercial thereis a standardization
 like we know that at this point i'm going to put this switch you're going todo that and everyone
 they know their rules captain's going to do this first officer's going to do thisand they know that when the emergency
 breaks out so in sully's case when they take the birds and they knowthey've got a problem and if you've
 listened to the cockpit recordings of him the two of them talkingyou know you gotta remember they're
 talking to each other when you hear the full tapes but they're also talking tothe air traffic controllers in the new
 york area and it's like we got a bird strike andthe first officer already knows hey
 silence the alarm they silence the alarm the first officer is pulling out thebook he's going through the procedures
 while sully's actually flying the airplane knowing that they've lost theirmotors and you got to think his decision
 process like they're trying to get him to go into an airport into new jerseyand he realizes not happening we're
 going to put this thing and he made a decision soon enoughso that he could prepare everyone on the
 airplane that he was going to put this thing in the hudson riverand he did it flawlessly i mean every
 single person walked away from that wreck the only thing that didn't survivewas the airplane you know and it got
 fished out of the hudson but

0:43:14
Speaker 1 :um what is it about those human
 decisions he had to make is that something you put into words oris that just
 deep down some instinct that you develop as a pilot over time it's when we

0:43:24
Speaker 0 :when you train uh you know an aviation
 is a self-cleaning oven so if you make bad decisionsyou're you know and the list is long and
 distinguished of those who have died by making bad decisionsoh man um so when you look at what he
 did or the way we train because the the commercial industry andthe navy and the air force for all that
 we have what's called we have emergency proceduresthat we have to know like engines on
 fire the first three steps you just have to know what they areright so they know the airline uh same
 type you know they go hey i know this is they pull the book out because theairplanes are designed they're built to
 have some time but there's a point where you have tomake a decision and you can't
 second-guess it so when he decided i'm putting this in the hudson riverhe couldn't all of a sudden halfway
 through it go well maybe i can get over to that airporthe he looked he made a quick assessment
 this is that 80 solution where you go these are not i'myou know it's
 like a multiple choice test when you go oh my god i don't really know the answerbut i know a and d
 are wrong yeah gone so the jersey airport and going back to laguardia goneyeah so what's my next option well the
 hudson river's there and that's probably looking pretty good or what is my otherone
 can i get a restart on the the motors and then if i can get a restart now cani take it someplace else
 he had to make really really fast decisions and then once they as theythey go that 80 solution you realize all
 right i'm going into the hudson there's the 80 percent get the book outlet's see if we can get an error star
 because if you listen to the tapes they're trying to get it air startedthe closer he gets to the water the more
 he's going i'm ditching the airplane so the original decision to this is mybest option right now
 this is where i'm going and you start eliminating anything that could possiblychange
 the events which they tried to do and then he gets to that last minute sayswe're going in the water
 they change the plan they secure the airplane they do exactly what they'redoing and he does that basically
 flawless landing on the on the hudson but you got to rememberevery s it's every six months for
 commercial they go back and they do research in the airplane in thesimulator where they train to
 the airplane being broken you just lost a motor you just lost another motorso they go through this extensive
 training you know and all these and it's you know you knowwe used to refer to it in the navy as
 the pain cave where you're gonna get in because you knowthat when you get in for your check ride
 in a simulator that the airplane is going to breakyou're going to lose hydra and it's
 sometimes there a problem like oh i just lost this hydraulic system but i'mhaving an issue on the other motor well
 if i shut down this motor and i've got a hydraulics you knowbecause there's two hydraulic systems
 one on each motor well if i've got an issue with the leftmotor hydraulic system and my right
 motor is starting to give me indications do i want to shut the right motor downbecause that's going to kill my
 hydraulic system that's good and now i'm flying on a good motor witha bad hydraulic system and without
 hydraulics the airplane won't fly so theyit's a really they're challenging
 problems that you have to think through in real time and of course the weather'snever good it's always dark
 it's always crappy you're going to break out it i mean it's just all this stuffgets compiled on top of you
 and it's intended to increase the level of stressbecause when things happen like in
 sully's case we like to joke it's going to stem poweryou know where the functional part of
 your brain shuts down and you are literally on instinct like an animalwell if you've trained so much that that
 is the instinctive reaction that you're going to havewhen the main part of your your your
 cognitive abilities start to shut down your you're running that instinct isingrained so much into you that you know
 exactly what to do and that's literally how it happens so

0:46:51
Speaker 1 :there's no
 how do i put it fear of death like in sully's casedo you think he was at all ever thinking
 about the fact if his decision is wrong a lot of people are going to die

0:47:04
Speaker 0 :you know i can't speak for him but i
 would say there was so much going on in the cockpit in that timehis his mindset was probably
 i can do this i'm trained i'm going to do the procedures i've practiced thisbefore
 i've done these things and you know i'm assuming that in his mindset because inever thought about when things were
 really bad you know if you're having problems with the airplane thatyou know that i was going to mort you
 know and and planted into the ground it was alwaysyou know maybe it's an ego thing where
 you think i can do this i mean

0:47:33
Speaker 1 :so you never have you experienced fear
 during flight like um i mean one one way who just offlinementioning mike tyson
 he talked about like uh as he's uh walking up to the ring he's likehe starts out basically in fear
 and uh yeah worried about how things are going to go i mean it'spurely to put in towards his fear but as
 he gets closer and closer to the ring is the confidence grows and grows until theego basically takes over to where you
 think there's no way anybody could uh defeat meso like that's that's his experience of
 overcoming fear but do you uh did you experience any kind ofthing like that or is that
 or do you just go to the part of the brain that goes to the trainingand then you just go to the instinctual
 80 solution

0:48:29
Speaker 0 :i wouldn't say i was never afraid i
 think that would be i can't i couldn't tell you that anyonei know that wasn't afraid at one time
 and for most of us especially navy carrierpilots it's just
 it's it's usually especially when you're new and you got to go out and it'snighttime
 and there's no moon and the weather sucks and the deck's movingyou know the ship's going up and down
 because it will scare lover living out of you

0:48:54
Speaker 1 :can i say that you can definitely say
 that so it's about landing or take

0:48:58
Speaker 0 :off that that is if you even they used
 to wire people up they did it during vietnamyou know guys that go flying missions
 you know when they were flying low and crazy stuff was going on andpeople were getting shot down a lot uh
 the highest the highest anxiety and heart rates werecoming back to land on board an aircraft


0:49:13
Speaker 1 :carrier how hard is it to land on that
 it seems impossible like for for a civilian i guess like me it justseems
 crazy that a human can do that the

0:49:23
Speaker 0 :problem with night
 is and there's different degrees of night just like day i mean there's theclear full moon night
 you know where it's like oh yeah you know this is not that badbut you gotta remember at night i think
 everyone can associate with you're driving in your car and it's justa it's it's an
 overcast dark night and you're on a country road with no side lightsmost people have a tendency to slow down
 just by nature of oh my god because you what you'll do is you'll out drive yourheadlights because it is so
 dark you know you can get outside you get outside the city and get up into newhampshire
 especially when the roads are curving you know and the lines probably aren'tthat good
 it's you know now take that and multiply it by like a millionbecause you have no depth perception uh
 what you think is fixed the runway

0:50:13
Speaker 1 :is actually moving up and down and left


0:50:15
Speaker 0 :to right
 yeah oh and when it's really bad you can actually see it moveand uh we have two systems uh you know
 there was a there's an automatic system that's actually uh it stabilizes withthe inertials on the ship
 and then there's the ils now civilian pilots will tell you that ils is aprecision approach which gives you
 azimuth and glide slope you know you come down it's like a pluson the carrier it's not it's really just
 a beam that goes out and it's considered a non-precision approach it'sit's not stabilized at all that and i've
 been where you can actually watch the needle and the and theattack hand needle will move there's all
 kinds of stuff moving because the base that it's all sitting onis doing this and ships don't just go up
 and down they they do this so the bow goes up and downand the tail like you normally see a
 ship and then there's so that's pitch andthen it has roll
 so it's doing this and then it has heave so the whole boat is going up and downwhile it's pitching and rolling
 and you're gonna land on that um so and it's i mean i remember landing as iwas with chris
 uh sado and uh chris and i we're off the uss ranger which is now decommissionedit's
 sitting getting turned into razor blades um we're flying the old a6 and we comein and it was off of san diego and it
 was just an ugly night because san diego always has a marine layer thatis about 1200 feet was lower than that
 that night and it was pouring down rain it was anel nino year and there's thunderstorms
 all around it was just the craziest night i've ever seen out of san diegoand i remember landing and your
 adrenaline is so high that you're shaking i mean you literally can't stopand we had spun around out of the
 landing area and we parked we caught the six-pack so it's right in front of theisland so if you see an aircraft
 carrier of the island and the number of the ship on it we're sitting right infront of that and we're looking at the
 landing area so it's like you get front row seats to the concertand
 and this this this ea 6b comes in you know ugly pass he ends up catching aone wire which is the first one you
 never want to catch the first one which means you werenot really high above the back of the
 ship when you landed and it comes in and the exhaust on an ea6 or an a6 actually points kind of down
 and it blows and it's blowing all the standing water on the aircraft that'show hard it's raining and you literally
 could not see a cross i mean i could see the front of my airplane his airplaneand then it was just white because of
 the water being blown off the deck and i'm shaking and i i i'll neverforget i looked over at chris and i said
 oh my god i go hey dude man ten thousand foot runway looks reallygood right now and i go and i'm shaking
 my hands like this and i said i'm not even this is i'm not faking thisdude i know that's literally i cannot
 stop shaking i said that scared the evil out of meyeah um
 but you but it scares you afterwards you don't during it you're not i'm notyou don't have time to think about that
 you're doing it you got to do this you know kind of the quote from tomhanks and uh
 what's that the girls baseball movie where he goes there's no crying inbaseball
 oh yeah that's our joke there's no crying in naval aviation i saidyou can fly around and cry all you want
 at night but you know there's only one pilot in those airplanes and you got toland it so
 you try all you want wipe the tears away you know putting on your big kid pantsand it's it's time to
 it's time to you know man up and land

0:53:17
Speaker 1 :atlanta jet
 sorry for the romantic question but going back to the the kid that dreamedto fly
 what's it like to fly an airplane what it looks incrediblelike as a human like a descendant of
 vape i sit here on land and look up at you guys it seems incrediblethat a human being can do that


0:53:40
Speaker 0 :you know people ask you know i'll be
 sitting around with my friends and they're like how was i saidthe greatest job on the planet i said
 you know you it's it's an office with a viewbecause you're sitting in a glass
 um you you can do uh you know it's like roller coasters yougo oh it does all these cool stuff so
 we take people flying every once awhile and it's like oh yeah i like rollercoasters like you know take any roller
 coaster the coolest roller coaster you've ever been onand multiply it by a thousand i said
 it's an experience uh you know to put your body under youknow
 you know the jets rated at seven and a half but it'll pull up to 8.1 before itover stresses depends on fuel weight
 so i mean you routinely get up there towards eight g'sum to be able to do that to your body i
 mean it takes a toll like i can't really turn my head real good anymore and andstuff like that but
 uh would i trade it i mean it was a childhood dream and how many people getto do that
 you know professional i want to be a nfl you know and you end up to the nfl whichis a very small percentage but
 well i want to fly jets and and to fly you know at the time when i was flyingthe super hornets that we had on our
 squadron were brand new like literally right out of the factoryi'd come off our first super hornet
 cruise we had went to the boeing factory in stlouis where they were building my new
 jets that i was going to get and i actually signed the inside of one of thewings
 while they were putting it together so i'm meeting the people that are puttingthe jet together that's going to get
 delivered to me in a couple of months that i'm going to flyso uh just i mean the whole of it


0:55:08
Speaker 1 :

0:55:10
Speaker 0 :is it's incredible i i it's i'll tell
 you what when i left when i decided to walk away uh yeah did

0:55:14
Speaker 1 :

0:55:16
Speaker 0 :i miss it
 i told myself i wouldn't i promised myselfthat you know once you get through your
 o5 command your flying really starts to tagto come down you know even if you and
 you're an airwing commander which is we call them cag carrier group commanderyou're not flying as much as like the
 normal pilots nor should you be i mean there'syoung people that are coming up and it's
 training your relief because that's the next generation solike currently i have friends of mine
 that we serve together their kids are flying super hornetsright so
 to me that's really neat because i watched them when they were littleand now you know one of them who was
 good friends uh is i won't get his last name but joeywho
 lived down the street from us is a top was a top gun instructor and i'm likehey joey's joe's a top gun
 you know and i'm like that's cool because you know i went there and i knewhim he would come down to my house and
 now to see these kids that are because typically military breedsmilitary you know because the kids grew
 up in it i mean and i the only reason that my son is notdoing it is he's colorblind
 so it it disqualifies you for being a pilot being a sealbecause he he talked about doing that
 because he's an incredible swimmer and he likes doing that stuff and water poloplayer
 but he's you know both my kids are well my daughter is a doctor andmy son's in his third year so but


0:56:35
Speaker 1 :there's a
 i suppose i mean from my perspective a bittersweethandover of this incredible experience
 of flying to the younger generation so you don'tyou told yourself you're not going to
 miss it

0:56:50
Speaker 0 :you miss it uh there are days i do when
 i hear jets like if i'm around a base or a jetflies over
 but i have all the memories so i can look at it and goit can't go on forever you know
 tom brady can't play football there's going to come a time where he has to

0:57:05
Speaker 1 :stop


0:57:06
Speaker 0 :he seems to have done it for a long time
 but you know typically when you look at ego i had theopportunity
 and i think as automation moves on especially with aithat you know when will when will the
 last manned fighter be built you know and that's that big questionyou know we just did f-35 it's
 over budget it's seven years late there's all kinds of issues when we tryand do it
 and then you look at some of the new stuff that's coming out that the airforce is working on with smaller
 cheaper uh attributable platforms that you can go ohwe can because if you don't put a man in
 the box or a person because there's a lot ofincredibly talented women that do this
 too um so i'll just say that as person yeah

0:57:48
Speaker 1 :so we say man
 and he we mean both men and women because offline you've told me about alot of incredible women that flown so


0:57:55
Speaker 0 :i had i had three three female
 actually four one of them didn't fly anymore she actually lives right aroundhere
 she she's uh she ended up going into aircraft maintenance when she couldn'tfly anymore uh
 one of the girls who everyone knows is incrediblyshe's one of the most gifted people i've
 ever met in my life she is the vice president of amazon air you can see heron tv her name is sarah
 incredible and then i had uh paige who ended up taking commanduh she got out of fighters and went into
 other platforms and she was a commanding officer andthen the other one is a
 teacher's leadership and she is all three of themactually all four of the women that were
 direct uh i'm not forgetting i don't think i'mforgetting someone uh
 incredibly incredibly talented uh and a great addition to the reading room soanyone who gets into the oh you know
 women can't do it that's all total horse crapyou know we can talk about the original
 integration and stuff which was not done well by the military nor the navy

0:58:55
Speaker 1 :so women can fly as good as the guys


0:58:58
Speaker 0 :yeah
 you can't tell if you pass another airplane you can't tell if there's a manor woman in it
 it really comes down to uh stick and throttlethe ability to
 extrapolate where the vehicle is going to be where the airplane would be ifyou're fighting another one
 you have to be able to think fast anyone has those characteristics uh can do itand then
 i think most important besides that there has to be a desireyeah and i'm not saying that everyone if
 you took because we used to track so when i ranwe call it the rag it's the replacement
 air group it's where so the the super hornet training squadronthere's two of them there's one on the
 east coast 106 and there's one on the west coastwhich is vfa 122.
 122 is the first one so i ended up going there and i ended up being theoperations officer and training officer
 okay so we tracked the last hundred studentsright so everyone goes ah it's funny to
 hear students talk because oh he's awesome he's super if you took thehundred
 there's three at the top of the list that are just naturally gifted aviatorsthey're well well well above average
 it's like the person in a math class that sits down in complex mathand they just get it you know at the
 bottom there's the three at the bottom that aregonna struggle and there's a good chance
 they won't get out and if they do get outthey're gonna have to work really hard
 to just maintain kind of average sometimes it's just the way your mindworks not everyone is good at everything
 if you took the 94 of them in the middle they're within one mean deviationof you know it's there they're all you
 know it's a the bell curve doesn't look real goodit's just a big hump and it comes back
 down and everyone's right there within onemean deviation and then you have the
 outliers usually not on the high side becausethey're going to get through but the
 outliers on the low side that don't make it throughso for the most part the navy does a
 really good job as does the air force of screening so now what they do when iwent you just showed up and you started
 now what you do is you actually go fly uh piper warriorslow wing to see can you are you
 adaptable to this and there's an evaluation that goesthrough and then if you hit a certain
 mark then you're good to go and then they put you into primaryit's kind of like a it's like a
 pre-check you know like the preset the pre-sat to go hey how am igoing to do on the sat it's
 it's very similar to that but it's more of a hand skillcan you adapt because although we live
 in three dimensions like this table is notyou know we this is you know this is all
 has depth with all that uh where it's really relative toaviation we are two-dimensional


1:01:21
Speaker 1 :very two-dimensional can you explain
 that so our perception is actually more limited than thethan that of an aviator very much and


1:01:28
Speaker 0 :here's why yeah so we look at
 uh let's look at a tall building let's look at one world trade center in newyork because that's
 everyone knows what it looks like big tall building umit's what maybe 1800 feet tall even the
 burjal dubai which is like what 20 700 feet tall it's not that big so asuper hornet to do a what a split s is
 which is i'm flying i'm just going to roll theairplane upside down and then i'm going
 to do basically a c the letter c i'm going to go in thetop and out the bottom
 so and i'm just basically a vertical displacement of the airplane so i'mgoing from high to low
 it's very very tight and it doesn't in about roughly about 2 500 feetgive or take a little so you go that is
 that is a really tight vertical turn yeah for example the a6 in order to dothat was about 9 000 feet
 and we look at a building that's 2000 feet high and think that istall right all right so in an aviation
 sense when you're starting to do vertical displacement maneuvers goingfrom 35 000 feet down to 20 000 feet in
 a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane because thehuman brain thinks we
 really are we like to be flat i see we think 2d soif i'm fighting how you really get an
 advantage when you're fighting another airplane is to work inthe vertical
 because most people will do like one move in the vertical and then they wantto start to flatten out because that's
 where we're comfortable

1:02:47
Speaker 1 :yeah it's very profound do you still
 think in like stacks of 2d layers or no or do you do you truly start to think inthat third dimension like
 the rich 3d world of uh like a fighting like do you start toactually be able to
 really experience the 3d nature

1:03:09
Speaker 0 :you do because you have to project where
 you're going to be so you have to know the performance of the airplane knowingthat hey if i do this maneuver that i am
 going to go it's it's kind of like when i when italk about when we were chasing the tic
 tac so the tic tac's coming up and i'm inabout you know and i've been doing this
 for at the time 16 years so i'm looking andi'm going hey i'm here
 he's there on the other side of the circle i'm going to do a verticaldisplacement i'm going to go like this
 i'm going to cut across a circle and i'm not going to him i'm going out in frontof him i'm going over here
 because i know that by the time i get through this maneuver that's where he'sgoing to be and i'm trying to you know
 basically join up on him but i also i also had to look at it togo do i have enough
 altitude to do this because what i didn't if we're here and i do this i'mgoing to end up over here and he's going
 to be above me and then you know i have to get that energy backto get up to him and when you're doing a
 max performance it's a trade so you have this is this isreally important when you're when you're
 fighting airplanes and you're really max performing so when you go to an airshow and you see the air demo
 he's literally playing with it he's got a finite amount of energyright he can add some with the motors
 and stuff but you're what you're really doing is it's a trade-off and you cantrade off
 kinetic energy speed for altitude which gives you potential energythe other piece is is i can trade some
 of that kinetic energy for performance because i know if i do a nice easy turnthe airplane will make it
 what doesn't bleed energy but i know if i do a real tight that 2500 foot split sthat it's going to cost me energy so if
 i enter the split s at 200 knots and i do it right i'm going to come out at thebottom at probably 200 knots although i
 lost 2500 feet of potential energy i converted that to that to kinetic andthat kinetic was transitioned and bled
 off the wings in order for me to get that highperformance turn and you have to
 constantly evaluate where you're at and it's youroverall energy package
 so you can have a guy that's behind you that looks like he's going to kill youbut if this jet is at 400 knots and this
 jet is at 110 knots this jet's just going to pull away drivearound and kill him in about 30 seconds
 right it's it's overall energy package and that's thatyou've got to be constantly evaluating
 where you're at and this is that 80 solution can i afford to do this or notyes no and you have literally a split
 second to make the decision the most

1:05:13
Speaker 1 :incredible
 dance of human decision making is just incredible i know a millionpeople want me to talk about tic tac and
 i i definitely will but let me ask the onelast uh ridiculous
 uh uh subjective question what's the greatest plane ever made in

1:05:33
Speaker 0 :

1:05:34
Speaker 1 :

1:05:35
Speaker 0 :you don't history to like from pure
 speed i would say sr-71 i think it's an engineering marvel that was actuallydeveloped in the 50s by kelly johnson
 you know skunk works for what that was able to do and when you get into historyof it you know how they actually
 built uh the cia actually made like six companies in order to buy thetitanium from russia
 to bring it back and build an airplane out of titanium that we would fly overrussia
 to me that's it's an incredible engineering marvel i thinkthat like the x-15 you know by the way


1:06:03
Speaker 1 :this sr sorry to interrupt sr-71
 still holds the the speed record for of any plane as far as i can understand

1:06:13
Speaker 0 :yeah what's funny when you get into it
 is it's remember fast is relative and when i saythat i mean
 so if you're going 3 000 miles an hour 100 feet above the ground you're going 3000 miles an hour
 through you know that's how fast you're going when you get up to altitudethere's an indicated airspeed and
 there's a you know your ground speed so yourindicated airspeed is really
 how fast the air is going past your airplane well the air is so thin upthere
 you may only be showing like 300 knots but at 300 knots you're really doing2500 miles an hour over the ground so
 you know like we would take the airplanes up to 50 000 feet when we hadto do
 full the maintenance check flights on them so when you're doing 200you know and you know some mod notch
 it's actually slow for the airplane it's you know you're getting you know it'skind of like it's not you know there's
 maneuvering speeds you know that if i hit a certain speedand a super hornet that i have the full
 capability of the airfoil if i'm below that speed i'm going tostall the airfoil before i get to the
 maximum g okay so when you look at something likethat you go
 is it really going fast and when you look at an sr 71 that's flying upwardsof you know
 70 plus thousand feet the air so thin you know just like the x15 you can getto a much higher
 speed but the relative speed of the air going over you is actually relativelylow
 so the stresses on the airframe are not like they would be if you were down lowbut because you're going fast to get
 enough air over your ketostatic system to show that you're going 300 knotsyou're you're screaming
 i mean the fastest i ever got was i was with theuh well soon to be vice admiral white so
 we had taken a check flight and uh and i got it up to 1.78 i got a superhorn up to mach 1.78 and it was
 and we were started by pebble beach too

1:07:58
Speaker 1 :and then it what's that feel like or is


1:08:00
Speaker 0 :it
 when you get that fast it start to me it got a little bit weird because yourealize
 in your brain and i did that there's no outif something happens i can't eject the
 ejection would kill me

1:08:11
Speaker 1 :isn't that kind of liberating in a way


1:08:14
Speaker 0 :um or no that
 okay maybe not i always want to push the limit you know it's like how fast icould have got it going faster
 it was it was literally still accelerating when i stopped but i had itwas fuel limited
 and space limited because i you know i'm off the coast of californiabig sur and i'm going and i can see
 pebble beach out in the distance uh you know the whole monterey peninsula justgoing
 and you're doing almost 18 miles a minute i mean you're screamingyeah i mean that's and then you have to
 turn well the airplane didn't have anything on it it was a slicked-offsuper hornet so it was basically just
 the airplane no pylons no pods no nothingand then we had to get it turned around
 because we got to go to the exit point for the area and i'm trying to get itdown below
 to subsonic and there's a bunch of things that are disabled like the speedbrakes that normally we pop out when
 you're going that fast they don't because the super hornet really doesn'thave speed brakes it
 deforms the flight controls they don't function so you reallyyou're trying to maneuver and when
 you're going that fast you can't turn because a 7gturn at 1.5 mach is a pretty big turn
 um so it's just it's crazy it's

1:09:15
Speaker 1 :incredible that a human can do this
 yes uh human can engineer that the system which allows another human tocontrol that system


1:09:24
Speaker 0 :it's to me it's it's uh i think it's
 just it's one it's a great experience

1:09:28
Speaker 1 :was it sad to see the sr-71 go
 i think it was during your career i mean do you do you guys romanticize thedifferent planes


1:09:37
Speaker 0 :um we would see it flying when i was
 flying hornets because we i the west coast flies in it's calledr2508 which is covers the
 navy china lake area and edwards it's a huge area it'sit's actually i think the we had a guy
 from switzerland come out because they were they had hornets and he's like thisis bigger than our whole country
 because it's a pretty big area in california that you flybut you would see the sr-71s they had a
 loop because nasa was flying them out of palmdale and they would take offand they'd go up towards washington
 state and montana and they do a loop and soyou'd see them coming back down they'd
 descend out of you know above 60 000 you'd see them you they get contrailsyou know the white
 lines behind airplanes they'd come down and hit the tanker and they'd go back upso
 it was cool to be able to see them in my lifetime flying uhbut uh you know i think with money
 age um the advent of satellites you know because they're everywhere nowi mean you've got commercial companies
 putting satellites up uh how much of that need was reallythere because you gotta remember when
 those things started in the 50s sputnik wasn't flying aroundyou know it was it was the u2 and the
 sr-71 that were out there doing that workum so at the time it was needed it was
 at the if you think about it really it was an incredible feat of aviation forthat time
 yeah i mean literally we have yet to pass that and you also ask well is therea need to pass that i go i don't know we
 got stuff in space so do we need to make anairplane that goes that fast
 i think the next one is you get into the hypersonics where you don't have to puta person in it does all kinds of crazy


1:11:01
Speaker 1 :stuff you know the work with automation
 all that kind of stuff yeah so one of the reasons i wanted totalk to you
 is you happen to be one of at least in my view one of the most crediblewitnesses
 in history of somebody who's uh witnessed a ufo literally anidentified flying object and
 not only witnessed but got to how do you put it like chase it essentiallychased it so let me just lay out
 i think it's easier than you telling the story maybeme and my dumb simpleton waste trying to
 explain the stories i understand it and then maybe you can correct meso on uh november
 10 2004 the uss princeton which is one of the thecarriers that's cruiser it's a
 it's a cruiser it's a cruiser so you

1:11:56
Speaker 0 :can't land on the uh no helicopter has a
 helicopter pad on the back

1:11:59
Speaker 1 :gotcha and it has weapons on it okay


1:12:01
Speaker 0 :gotcha it shoots the missiles up


1:12:02
Speaker 1 :but it has a nice radar just that


1:12:03
Speaker 0 :incredible spy one system
 phased array four panels so looks in

1:12:09
Speaker 1 :quadrants
 perfect so they they started noticing on november 10ththat there is a few objects flying
 around at 28 000 feet with speed of uh with what's iguess is considered a low speed of 120
 miles an hour i don't know what that in knots but uh out on the coast ofcalifornia
 so and they kept detecting these objects for just about a weekthen comes in like your part of the
 story which is on november 14th from the i guess it's from the ussnimitz
 i you flew and witnessed a 40 foot long white tic-tac-shaped objectwith no wings flying in ways you've
 never thought possible and in some interview somewhere you saidi think it was not from this world
 so there's a mysterious aspect to this objectthis entire situation uh there's videos
 involved the video of a flareforward looking infrared
 receiver receiver there's also a visible light so you can switchyeah i mean tv mode as a tv mode so that
 gives you visible light and then it has ir mode and uh chad underwood recordedthat video
 so and those are the videos that were released by the pentagon laterone of the three videos the two other
 videos uh go fast and gimbalwere recorded in 2000 something 14-15
 uh on the east coast of the united statesthey had different kinds of objects but
 they were weird in the same kind of way in termsof at least the videos
 and the experiences that people have described were similar in inthe degree of weirdness
 but uh the differences is actually on the the east coast of 2014case
 very few people have spoken about it and even in your situationvery few people have spoken about it so
 there's a mystery to it but it's in some sense this is a quitesimple story
 without much resolution to the mystery and it's fascinating and there'sa lot of opinions there's division of
 opinions because uh it's a mysterious i mean ittruly is a ufo
 in the sense that uh uap uh what is it i i unidentifiedaerial phenomena so can you
 maybe correct me on any of the things i've gotten wrong elaborate on some keythings
 and describe that experience in general

1:14:53
Speaker 0 :so here's what i know so yeah
 we went out uh on our mission to go train uh and they canceled the missionand they set us down there's all kinds
 of rumors out here there's all kinds of after this has come out so originally itwas the four of us
 there's two jets two people in each jet their f-18sokay there is no video from
 our event it was all four sets of eyeballs staring at this thing and thenwhen we came back and told it
 when chad and his pilot took off that's when chad got the video of itand we're like that's it that's exactly
 that's it and um

1:15:28
Speaker 1 :so when you say eyeballs you mean
 literally your eyes are seeing a thing

1:15:33
Speaker 0 :yeah so so as we're flying out we get we
 get vectored they come up and tell us hey we're gonna cancel training this isthe uss princeton so this is the siege's
 cruiser so we're talking to one controller umwho is like hey sir first you ask what
 ordinance we have on board and i laugh because we don't carry live ordinance intraining typically because batch
 stuff happens usually someone forgets to put a switch on and then the missilecomes off and hits a good airplane and
 it's not good so we had what's called a catom9 which is really just a blue tubewith the
 aim 9 seeker on the front of it which is an ir missileso there's only two ways to get it off
 you can beat it off with a sledgehammer you can take this thing and soyou put a wrench in and it unlocks the
 lugs and pulls the lugs back in that hold it onwhen it really fires the impulse from
 the engine actually throws the lugs forward and breaks that release and itcomes off down the rail
 that's how it works so they said hey wellwe have real world tasking so as we're
 going out my wingmen the other pilot she maneuversthe airplane to the left-hand side
 of me so she's kind of stepped up like this and i'll use your mic boxto start since we're going out they're
 calling ranges they're called bra calls bearing range in altitude and they'retelling us hey
 it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40 miles and 30 miles so they're sayinghey 270 30 20 000. that's all i say
 so we got our radars we had we had mechanically scanned radars at the timeapg-73 good piece of gear
 apg-79 new one's way better but anyway

1:16:58
Speaker 1 :and i apologize if i interrupt the story
 uh hopefully it's useful but they're telling you a location of a thing thatyou should look at


1:17:06
Speaker 0 :yep they're telling us they have a
 contact on their radar they don't know what it is they just have a blipthey have a little blip well they've
 been watching these things and what he told me isthey had been looking at these things as
 we're driving i said sir we've been tracking these things for about twoweeks that's we had been at sea for two
 weeks because this is the first time we've hadplanes airborne we want you to go see
 what these are

1:17:22
Speaker 1 :gotcha so they kind of interrupt the
 mission to say

1:17:27
Speaker 0 :check it out so we start driving out
 there and uh as we get down to he's going youknow
 20 miles 15 miles 10 miles and then you get to a point where they call mergeplot which means we are
 inside of the resolution cell of the radar because radars don't seeeverything they're so they have a range
 and they have an azimuth resolution right so and it's basically think of alittle cube so they can
 and the whole sky is made of all these little cubes and they're looking so ifyou're inside a cube with something and
 you're both inside the same little cube then the radar can only see one thingdoes that make sense yeah yeah
 so they call merge plot when we say merge plot to usit means he's right around something's
 around you get your head out so we're not looking at radar scopes anymore andthe wizards the wizards can look but
 everyone it's heads out when they say merge plot you're donelooking at your displays inside you're
 doing this and you're trying to find it so as welook out to the right and you look high
 and low because he could be anywhere from the surface all the way up now keepin mind the ship is like probably 60
 miles away so it can't see the surface and you can do your standardradar horizon calculation and go hey
 it's the the thing is 40 feet off the water thepanel can he really see
 you know there are radars that can see around the curve but let's just say thatit can't
 at this time so you go is it you know where's it atso as we're looking around we see now
 this is a it's a clear day there's no cloudsand there's no white caps it's just a
 calm it's actually a perfect day if you owneda sailboat it was that five to ten knots
 of wind and you just want to kind of go out there and you're not going to getbeat up and have white water coming
 it was the perfect date on a sailboat

1:19:02
Speaker 1 :how many miles out do you see like seven
 like you see just it's a clear day

1:19:07
Speaker 0 :it's 50 it's unrestricted visibility you
 can see literally all the way to horizon it's justclear it's nothing and we're basically
 off the coast if you look at a map and you gosan diego and then inside of mexico
 we're kind of in between that and we're probably about by the timethis all hits we're price
 i don't know eighty hundred i don't know but somewhere out it's pretty far offthe coast perfect
 from 20 000 feet you'd be amazed you can do the calculation you can see stuffyou know you'll see land 50 miles away
 you can see you know and when you're looking ata continent it's really easy to see
 you're not looking at an island i mean you're looking at mexico

1:19:41
Speaker 1 :and you can see on the white gaps in the
 water if there is any oh yeah they're

1:19:44
Speaker 0 :easy
 yeah for us we look at it because we know if it's natural wind orso if it's a really white cap windy day
 then the ships just kind of barely be moving when we land on it it makes itactually easier
 if the ship has to move where it's got a big weight because it has to make itsown wind when we land which is the day
 that it was this day you go oh okay and it creates what'scalled we call the verbal but when the
 air flows across the flight deck it drops behind the ship you knowand then it kicks back up so when you're
 coming board to land it's going to make you go up a little bit and then you'regoing to fall and you've got to con
 you've got to anticipate that to stand glideslope so we're prettywe're pretty conscious of what's going
 on out there with the waves and the wind so we look there's no waves there's nowind there's no white caps
 and we look down and we see white water so if you put if you put a piece of landa sea mount below the surface
 like you know even 20 feet below the surface that's big enoughas the waves come in you know waves have
 height and length when they come in that's what happens onthe shore when a wave comes in it hits
 and then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave height up becauseit can't go anymore and then it breaks


1:20:47
Speaker 1 :the top and yeah and that's where you
 get the white

1:20:48
Speaker 0 :so what happens is at sea when you get a
 sea mount you'll see stuff come in the wave will crash and you'll get whitewater
 you can go out when it's high tide in any one of the coasts you can go outhere off of boston and go hey at low
 tide i can see those rocks and at high tide i can't see the rocks are coveredbut there will be white water around
 those rocks you'll be able to tell there's something underneath the surfacedoes that make sense
 yep so that's what it was we see we don't see an object because there'sall kinds of oh they saw this they saw
 another craft below the way we didn't see anything below the waterwe just saw white water but the white
 water and i like to shape it you can say it was across i say it's about the sizeof a 737 so it looks like if you took a
 737 put it about 15 20 feet below the waterso the waves breaking over the top and
 you're going to get white water where the plane is at you'd seethis this kind of shape so it looks like
 a cross so as we're looking down off the rightside the back seater in the other
 airplane jim says this is that talking in parcelsagain he says hey skipper do you and
 that's about what he gets out of his mouth and i gowhat the hell is that in a nice do you


1:21:47
Speaker 1 :see that essentially


1:21:48
Speaker 0 :so we see the white water and that's
 what draws our eyes down or otherwise we'd have never seen it

1:21:53
Speaker 1 :so we see this i would love to see the
 look on your face when you see that

1:21:55
Speaker 0 :and then we see this little white tic
 tac because we're about 20 000 feet above it and it's doingit's going basically north south and
 then east west north and so it's abrupt it's very abrupt so it's notuh like a helicopter if a helicopter is
 going sideways and it goes once it's going sidewaysleft and it goes right what it'll do is
 it'll go it's got a speed it slows down because there's inertiayeah and it stops and then it goes back
 the other way this thing's not it's like left right left right with no so moving

1:22:21
Speaker 1 :in ways that doesn't
 doesn't feel intuitive to you at all of the things you've seen in the past

1:22:27
Speaker 0 :so as a pilot the first thing you think
 is it's a helicopter right right so you go oh what is becausewhen we see it's moving we're like oh
 helicopter so the first thing you look for to seeif it's a helicopter when they're doing
 that because usually when they get down there towardsthat 50 feet you'll get rotor wash
 you see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water it kicks thewater comes up besides because the
 downdraft you know like a thunderstorm will dothat it pushes the air down and then it
 has to come out the sides so you see it and you go well there's nothere's no rotor wash what is that thing
 so by this time we're driving around so as we're if we were at the six o'clockwe're driving around towards that nine
 o'clock position and we're just watching this thing and it's just it's stillpointing north-south and it's going
 left-right and it's kind of moving around the object and if it had if i hadto say it biased itself
 it was biased towards the bottom half so if you've got the east-west and then thenorth-south kind of across
 it's hanging out on the southern thing that's hanging out it's just kind ofmoving around up down left and it's
 crossing over it it's going up just kind ofso now we're like what the hell is that
 so then i go hey i'm gonna go check it out and theother pilot says
 i'm gonna stay up here and i said yeah stay up high because now we get we get adifferent perspective
 so she's up here and i'm down here as i'm descendingshe can watch because right now all i'm
 watching is the tic tac she can watch me and the tic tac so shegets a god's eye view of everything
 that's going on which is really important you can you'll hear people sayit's high cover whatever
 she's watching me which is it's perfect as the story goes on because it it givesus two perspectives
 you know of a perspective that's about 8 000 feet above uswhen that thing disappears and they
 don't you know because if it's just like oh i lost itand they go no it's over to the right we
 can still see it we all lost it at the same timeso as we come down we get to about 12
 o'clock and i'm descending it's an easy descent i'm doing about 300 knotswhich is a really good air speed for the
 airplane for maneuvering because i have i have everything available to meat that speed
 so i'm coming down and as i get to 12 o'clock as the tic takes doing this itliterally it's like
 it's aware of us and it just goes blue and it kind of pointsout towards the west and starts coming
 up so now it's obviously knows that we're therewhatever this thing is and knows over
 there so as we drive around it's coming up and i'm just coming down we're justi'm just watching it now you remember
 this whole thing is like this is like five minutes this is not likewe saw it it was gone or oh i saw lights
 in the sky and they were gone we watched this thing on a crystal clearday
 with four trained observers watch this thing fly around so we're likeokay so i get over to the eight o'clock
 position and i'm a little i'm a couple thousand feet above it and it's about soi'm probably at about 15k i think it is
 i think that's my story's about 15. it's just estimatingso you can see it's just really easy to
 set because

1:25:04
Speaker 1 :so what's 15k 15 000 feet i thought it
 was 8 000

1:25:09
Speaker 0 :uh the the other airplane ends up about
 yeah okay so they're still about twentythousand feet so they're all right
 slowly and i'm descending they're staying up there so i'm kind of doingthis
 okay as they drive around okay so i'm looking at this thing and it's about thetwo o'clock position we're about the
 eight o'clock position and i'm like oh i've goti've got enough altitudes i'm gonna i'm
 gonna cut across the circle and i tell the guy in my back seatdude i'm gonna i'm gonna do this he's
 like go for it skip because i was a skipperso i cut across the bottom so i'm kind
 of almost coming out co-altitude as thisthing's coming i'm gonna meet it
 and i'm driving and uh i get to probably it's i'm probably about a half mile awaywhich you think well a half miles pretty
 far a half mile in aviation isn't it's nothing that's i mean you can tellthere's a pilot in an airplane you can
 see all kinds of stuff at a half mile you can see pretty good detail so i'mlike right there and it's coming across
 my nose so now i'm basically pointing back towards the east so i'm cuttingacross
 because i'm going to the three o'clock position it's at two o'clock and i'mgonna meet it at three o'clock
 so as i do this it goes it just accelerates and disappears so it's thishappens at around
 estimating about 12 000 feet so they're at 20. so they've got about 8 000 footof altitude above us when this happens
 and it just as it crosses our nose it just it accelerates andliterally in less than you know probably
 less than a half second it just goes and it's goneand so we're like and i the first thing
 is dude did you guys see it the other airplane'slike it's gone we don't we
 have no idea where it's at so we kind of spin around rook i go let's see what'sdown here and i turn around we're
 looking for the white water we can't the white water's gone there'snothing it's literally all blue so now
 you go and i remember telling the guy in myback seat like a dude i'm
 i don't know about you but i'm pretty weirded out because this is i meanyou know i had at the time like 30 some
 hundred hours of flying i'd been doing it for 18 years it's nothing like

1:26:53
Speaker 1 :anything you've seen no


1:26:55
Speaker 0 :no so as we turn we go well let's just
 go back you know because now i got to put on my real hat which wehave to train because we're getting
 ready to deploy to you know overseas so we got to getour training done so
 that's my mindset especially as a ceo because i got to get i got it trainingout of the flight time because i'm
 responsible to do that so hey let's go back and the the the guywho's going to be the bad guys is the
 ceo of the marine squadron and uh so cheeks is at the end he'slistening to all this happen you know
 because he's just like because he they when he first went outthey were gonna do him but the little
 hornets the legacy hornets f-18cs don't have as much gas as the superhornets so he had
 launched first and they were going to do him and then when they knew we were offthe deck they just told him hey go to
 your cat point down south and we're going to send we'll pass thisoff to


1:27:41
Speaker 1 :the supermarkets what's the cap point uh


1:27:42
Speaker 0 :that's where we hold so it's called a
 combat air patrol point so we're just going to hold at oneend he's going to hold at the other end
 it's kind of like hey you guys are going to each think if it's a football fieldwe're going to sit on one goal line he's
 going to sit on the other goal line and when they say go we're going to run ateach other and
 try and do something in the middle of the field and then go back to our setreset points okay


1:28:01
Speaker 1 :so you're talking to him he's he's he's


1:28:04
Speaker 0 :listening to the he's just listening we
 don't talk to him at all he's just listening he just dials up because theyknow that we all know the frequency so
 he's listening to what's going on because he's like because they canceltraining so what else is he gonna do
 he's just gonna hang out there and do circles while he's waiting him and hiswingmen
 so they're just they're listening to all

1:28:18
Speaker 1 :this go on and then at this point you
 move on

1:28:20
Speaker 0 :yeah we come back up to train we go back
 as we're flying back the controller because we're talking tothe the kid on the princeton
 the uh the uh they're called os's they're operation specialists they'rethe ones that run the radars
 and we're talking to him and he's like hey sir you're not gonna believe thisbut that thing is at your cap
 it showed back up it just popped up you know this is like 60 miles away it justreappears we're like oh
 okay so we got the radars out we're looking for ituh we get out there we never see it we
 never see it again uh we do what we need to do we come backto the ship of course now we're like oh
 this is gonna be we're you know i told i told him i godude you know we're gonna catch we're
 gonna catch for this when we get back to the ship word'sgonna get out and we're just gonna catch
 maximum and we did yeah and it's kind of that joking youknow so the ship plays movies we have
 movies on the boat and they do 12 hours of movies so theyrepeat because there's a day check and a
 night check so the same movies in the morningand night play so you never get to ever
 get to watch a whole movie on the boat which drives my wife crazy because i'llwatch stuff on tv that way too i'll be
 like oh hey i've seen this and i'll jump into a movie in the middle andthen i'll pick it up later and i'll see
 the beginning and i'll put it all togetherbecause that's how we have to do it
 because we're so busy well the movies becameand i it was men in black aliens uh
 independence day definitely gonna catch

1:29:33
Speaker 1 :

1:29:35
Speaker 0 :some


1:29:37
Speaker 1 :oh
 let me just ask some dumb questions so just take him because it'swhatev whatever the heck you saw
 whatever the heck happened it's you know one of the mostfascinating things um
 events in recent history so whatever it was it's interesting to talkabout it different kinds of angles
 there's no good answers but it's interesting to ask some dumb questionshere
 so first of all you mentioned see you saw at some pointxy and then uh somebody in the princeton
 said you're not going to believe the sir it'sat your cap point that that's a
 different place how the heck did it know what your cap point is

1:30:17
Speaker 0 :that's a good question and that's the
 one if you don't no one you know you don't we don'ttell it it's we don't broadcast it we
 have a waypoint in the system but i don't know maybe it knew where wewere going because we used the same one
 day after day after day but it it obviously knew but you never

1:30:32
Speaker 1 :

1:30:33
Speaker 0 :saw it there never saw their chad when
 he took off when he got the video we landed we told them hey look we justwe just chased this thing they're like
 when i go chased it and they're like why godude and i told him i said dude get
 video and he goes so and that's how he is he's like i'mgonna go and he he was he he was
 determined he was gonna find this thing sowhen you look at his video and this is
 the stuff that isn't out that they don't see becausenot all the all you see is the flare
 tape that's the targeting pod the forward-looking infrared receiver

1:31:03
Speaker 1 :um i'll probably overlay the video when


1:31:05
Speaker 0 :he goes out
 it's uh you know what he's looking at on his displays is he has basically tworadar displays up
 he has azimuth and range on the right one and he has the azimuth and elevationon the left one so this is called the as
 l display and this is called this is basically the ppi which is theyou're at the bottom of it
 you're at the bottom of the square it's really taken this it's taking a conebecause a radar really looks left and
 right from a point and it squares it out so the entire bottom of the scope thatwe look at is us
 because they do this they square it off so so he goes out and when he first seesit he gets a radar return on it because
 when he's not trying to lock it so the radar's just throwing energy out andgetting it you know it's a doppler radar
 so when it's in search mode that's all it's doing it's going oh i can see youi can see and it's looking for return so
 he gets a return so he wants to see what it is because all you get is a littlegreen square unless it builds a track
 file on it but a little green square is justsitting there it's not moving because
 it's it's sitting in one spot in space he locks it up when he goes tolock it up now he's putting a bunch of
 energy on it but he's telling the radar stare downthat line of sight and whatever's there
 i want you to grab it and build a track file on it which willtell us how high it is how fast it is in
 the direction that it's going okay the radar smartenough that when the signal comes back
 if it's been messed with it will tell you it'll give youindications that i'm being jammed
 so that's all it is is you send the signal out something it manipulates thesignal either in range and velocity or
 whatever and it sends it back and the radar was smart enough to gothat is not a return that i'm expecting
 something's messing with me i'm being jammed and it shows you and it putsstrobes up it gives these lines on the
 radar and it does some stuff so you can immediately well itdoes it goes full into
 it it's being jammed in about every mode you can possibly see because everythingcomes up and the
 the this aspect gets long it's all kinds i don't want to get into details but youcan tell it's being jammed


1:32:51
Speaker 1 :so and as you said on rogan by the way
 that jamming is an act of war active

1:32:54
Speaker 0 :jamming isn't
 when you actively jam another platform yes it's technically an active work

1:32:58
Speaker 1 :feels like you should be freaking out at
 this point

1:33:01
Speaker 0 :i mean so well he does it and then in
 the back seat so they don't have a stick and throttle they havetheir side stick controller so they can
 control all the sensors and they can just toggle around and do stuff sohe can he has the ability to just move
 one switch real quick and it will go from that azimuth elevation on the radarto the targeting pod
 well as soon as he commanded the radar to look at that targetthe targeting pod goes oh what's over
 there and it'll stare because it goes down the line of sight because all thesystems are hooked together
 you can decouple them but they're going to automatically couple upso when he castles over he it's a switch
 looks like a castle switch was a castle sowhen he moves that thing to the left and
 he swaps the displays out and he says instead of looking at the radar i wantto look at the targeting pod
 he sees it on the targeting pod because the targeting pods already looking thereand now he's on a passive track because
 he's not literally sending any energy out he's just receiving ir energy fromthe tic tac and then the system itself
 will track the pixels and the contrast differencesit depends on what mode you're in
 so it says oh and that's what those little bars you see in the video wherethe bars come up let's


1:33:58
Speaker 1 :do some v vision based tracking that's


1:34:02
Speaker 0 :exactly what it is
 um so that's the video he goes through

1:34:05
Speaker 1 :changes zooms changes the momentum he


1:34:08
Speaker 0 :goes through all the modes so there's a
 narrow medium and wide so wide is far awaymedium and then narrow and then
 there's the tv mode and he goes from ir mode to the tv modethe cool thing with the tv mode is
 narrow ir mode is only medium tv mode so you can actually getcloser with narrow tv mode it's got a
 better zoom capability when you go into tv modeum so he goes through all those things
 that's when you see it going from a black background to a white background

1:34:35
Speaker 1 :he's trying to figure out what the heck


1:34:36
Speaker 0 :is this
 well yeah and he wants to get as much data as he can on it based on thedifferent modes instead of just staring
 at it going what is that thing um green so that the video has been outfor it it actually was on youtube for
 years and before the government released it it

1:34:50
Speaker 1 :was leaked at 2007.


1:34:53
Speaker 0 :about no i got a the guy that was in my
 backseat sent me an email and i had retired sothis is about
 nope because i was working i was working down in san diego so this is about2008 early 2009
 he sends me a link to strangeland.com which is not suitable for work oh yeahit's top notch yeah um
 and he says hey i can remember the email hey skip does this look familiarand i look at i'm like how the hell did
 that get on strangeland.com so the next thing youknow it ends up on
 youtube which was cool because you can send a youtube link to someoneyou don't send strangeland.com to
 someone because you don't know what you're going to getit's like googling kittens yeah um so


1:35:44
Speaker 1 :it ends up there somehow so it gets on


1:35:46
Speaker 0 :youtube which was cool because
 i would go out with my friends and we'd be drinking and they they go dude what'sthe coolest thing you ever saw flying
 you know it's kind of like you were asking what it's like and i gooh dude i chased the ufo and they're
 like get out and i'm like no serious so this is literally how it happenedso i was sitting with my friend matt so
 matt and i did our my he was the guy in my right seat of thea6 when i did my very first night trap
 right and we were friends to this day right becausewhen you do stuff like people like that
 you know you had to have faith in him he had to have faith in meyou know they're they become like your
 brother yeah um and these are guys that literally youknow i don't talk to him on a regular
 basis like chris who works at apple if if chris called meup tomorrow and said dude i need help i
 need this i'd be like all right let's figure thisout and let's do it because it's they're
 like family you do it and most navy guys we don'twe're not we don't send letters to each
 other weekly you know i have friends that could ihaven't talked to in 10 years that they
 showed up on my door you know pop a bottle of wine grab abeer shoot the
 take about first 10 minutes to catch up and then it's it's like old times andit's it's amazing how fast this happens
 so incredible so i'm out to dinner with matt um andi'm telling him this story and he's like
 get out of here so he goes back and he tells our friend pacopaco has fightersweep.com it's a blog
 site so paco's obsessed like he is way intoufos yeah
 so paco calls me up he says dude i was talking to maddie that's what we callhim he goes i was talking to maddie
 he goes dude you got to tell me this storyso i'm like all right so i spend a chunk
 of time and so he calls me one day and i'm like i get avoicemail
 hey give me a call so i call him up and he answers the phone but i can hearpeople in the background and i go hey
 dude what's going on i go hang on hang on i gotta put you on speakerphone i gowhat do you put me on speakers you got
 to tell the story i'm having a dinner partyyou got to tell the story so he's
 literally having a dinner party with his cell phone in the middle of the table asi tell a tic tac store
 so he calls me up again he says hey i got this blogand he just writes about fighter stuff
 like he wrote about that we call him the  hot break that's a guy that whenyou're land on a carrier comes
 and turns and gets ready to land really fast like breaks it off right at theback of the ship
 and uh one of the guys when we were junior officers on the uss ranger one ofthe apartments the other squadrons guy
 nasty and nasty was notorious for coming in in the tomcat and cranking off the hot break
 right so he he he literally wrote a thing about the hot break withnasty and there's another guy or mav was
 our uh one of our landing signals officers forthe air wing
 it just it was it's just it's a good article on how this was and howyou know it it kind of forms you in
 naval aviation's kind of being kind of a part of the club so he's like i gottawrite about this thing i'm like what are
 you guys i gotta write about i go all righti go because at first i would say no i'm
 like dude i don't want this out there

1:38:33
Speaker 1 :just
 so you haven't really before then talked about it much

1:38:36
Speaker 0 :because my wife didn't even really know


1:38:38
Speaker 1 :the whole story what just as a comment
 is it just because you caught some no uh it was just i'll tell you what

1:38:43
Speaker 0 :three days we we had the incident
 for about two days they played the goofy movies there there's a comic on the backof the air wing schedule
 that they would put it was like first one was a far side and the second onewas
 me and the guy in my back seat and it was men in black but it had our namesyou know protecting the world
 protecting the nimitz battlegroup type stuff it's just funny like thatyeah
 um so that was just to me it wasn't that big of a deal it was like okay that'sweird we're never gonna know what it was
 i want to get out because this is important because there's all kinds ofrumors there's a group of folks
 no one ever came out in suits

1:39:19
Speaker 1 :to talk to us nobody looking like me
 no came out on a uh no no one came out

1:39:23
Speaker 0 :of the helicopter no one came out on an
 airplane you know you get oh i i was told to turnover this classified what's funny is
 all the cos and several are still in the navyuh there's one that is a he i think he
 just finished up he was a captain of an aircraft carrieryou know so he'll end up making admiral
 and all that stuff those guys are all my friends i talk to

1:39:46
Speaker 1 :them daily just just to clarify
 so just for people who don't know there's a storythat both on the nimitz and the
 princeton folks in a helicopter landedthey showed up they took the data
 quote-unquote so all the sort of recordings associatedwith this
 incident and they took it and presumably deleted itthere's a kind of story to that and then
 uh from what i've seen you said that you believejust like we were talking about offline
 that jokes spread faster than uh or just rumors spread faster thananything on on these ships
 uh that it might have been a joke that started

1:40:29
Speaker 0 :and uh well they did so here's here's
 the joke yeah so they had come down right we had the tapes um and they werechad's tapes
 so we use those tapes over and over again you know they're they'reconsumable but remember i have a budget
 as a squadron so i have a budget so i have to buy those tapes i have toall that stuff that we use i'm
 accountable for and the tapes are actually classified secret because ofthe data that's on them
 okay so we had the tapes so the the secure the intelligence guysthe intel officers came down from what's
 called civic it's cvic which is carrier intel centercame down and said hey we need the tapes
 these guys are going to come they're going to come and get them thisis so we're like i'm like oh whatever
 you know so we hand them the tapes and thensomeone because i have you know you know
 people shortly after they came and got thetapes someone came to me and said you
 know they're they're messing with you they're playing a jokeso i said oh let's see how well that
 goes because you know i'm i'm a ceo and they're not and uh soi went down to civic
 and uh it was probably he was a lieutenant or a lieutenant jg so he'sway junior to me
 and i said hey uh i want my tapes back and he looks at me and i go i know youguys are pulling my leg i know you
 there's no one came out and i go and you have about 30 secondsto get me my tapes before i start
 tearing this place apart that's literally what i told him and isaid and if your boss has an issue
 he can come and see me because it's not going to go welli said because this is and i
 need those tapes then he literally walked right over to a filing cabinetopened it up they weren't a safe he
 opened up a filing cabinet and pull them out and hand them to mei said and i basically said a few things
 to him like don't ever with me againand i left i had the tapes so this no
 one came out there's no flying going on when all thisis happening and i took the tapes back
 and then i copied the tapes so i took two brand new eight mil tapesand i copied the sections that i want so
 there's a rumor too that oh the original flair video is 10minutes long and there's some one of
 these petty officers saying i saw it that's total crap the original video isabout a minute 30 seconds long what you
 see on the release video is the entire video

1:42:31
Speaker 1 :so you have mentioned
 uh i apologize if i say stupid things please correct me butyou you have mentioned that like on
 rogan i think that you watched it on you know on abigger screen it felt like it was higher
 definition so let me ask the the questionis there a higher definition version do
 you think of the flair video that would give us morepixels and more information
 presumably because of the um

1:43:01
Speaker 0 :because i don't know where the stuff
 that the government released i don't know where they gotokay so the stuff that was on
 strangeland and youtube you know someone pulled off of a secretit looks like a rack you know there's
 tape machines in there and it gets converted to digital and stored on ahard drive and they pulled it off that
 hard drive and they put it on youtube um no it's it's just like you knowanytime
 even a digital media the more you copy digital media there's some quality thatgets it degrades
 so this you don't know how many times this has been copied so we were lookingthe videos i've seen are right off the
 original they're high eight tapes that's basically pulled off the back of thedisplay so it's not filmed with cameras
 it's literally a digital feed it's pulled off the backand put onto a high eight tape that's
 how the recorders work now it's actually digital to digital it's not even ontapes anymore it's it's a digital
 recording system but we were still in that process of slowing up becauseoriginally we had little cameras here
 that shine so if the light hit it would wash out the displays so this it's apretty good feed
 um when you put it on so we're instead of looking at it on your tiny littlecomputer monitor whatever
 i'm looking at it on a like a 19-inch because it was still normal tvs backthere we had just put flat screens in
 the ready room that i had bought so we could watch movies so because a

1:44:08
Speaker 1 :nice huge 19-inch screen


1:44:11
Speaker 0 :it says maybe 20. it's nice wow that's


1:44:13
Speaker 1 :huge


1:44:14
Speaker 0 :gigantic um hey i can get for like


1:44:18
Speaker 1 :50 bucks you can get like 60 engines


1:44:20
Speaker 0 :this is 2005. yeah


1:44:23
Speaker 1 :um so so you look at this big thing and


1:44:25
Speaker 0 :but you could see so when you get to the
 tv mode when i say there's little things coming out of the bottom of it you couldsee those
 it was very clear but in terms of the

1:44:31
Speaker 1 :actual
 visual on the tic tac was it did you get much more information from the higher

1:44:40
Speaker 0 :from the clear little things out of the
 bottom

1:44:41
Speaker 1 :to the bottom information so when you


1:44:44
Speaker 0 :see it because he's coming almost
 co-altitude with it you can see the bottom of it it looks like littleyou know like if you look at a cessna
 there's a little antennas hanging on the bottom kind of like that there's twolittle things on the bottom
 there's nothing on the top there was no plume no ir nono visible propulsions even heat
 signature you know it's all that stuff and thenthe other thing that people didn't see
 is they didn't see the the radar display uh which that that really raises theclassification level especially to see
 what the radar does when it's being jammedum you know matter of fact when they did
 the unofficial official investigation in about 2000 and let me think about 2009
 um i had gotten a call on my cell phone from a guy whogovernment employee and said hey
 told me who he was he's still in the government um i'm friends with him andhe said hey
 we're going to investigate your tic tac thing this is literallyfive years later yeah five years later
 and i said okay whatever and he did a pretty goodjob i caught the unofficial official
 report because um it was really never officialit wasn't but i'll give you the history
 of why i say that and why it never came out in foia requestsso he does the report he sent me the
 report and all he said is hey i'm going to send you this reportplease don't distribute this report i
 said okay the report is now out because harry reidgot it to george knapp
 and they were good enough to redact there's a few versions of it unredactedand i'm very protective of the other
 people that were involved in this so jim has talked buthe's off the grid he doesn't talk to
 anyone now the pilot of his airplane she has comeout on unidentified but
 they don't release her name although people are starting to do it and she'shad weird
  happen around her house she's got kids you know so i'm very protective ofher
 um and i've told people like jeremy and george if i know that the names evercame from you i will never talk to you
 again about this and jeremy's been really good about it and so is georgeand then but george george knew the
 names were because he had he got the report from senator reidum and then the other crew so the pilot
 of the airplane that took the video that chad was in if you talkto
 that individual they really don't have the recollection they were just outflying that day and it wasn't a big deal
 um so it's it's you you need to protect because not everyone wants peopleknocking i don't want people knocking on
 my door and you know and there's rumors oh youtalk to everyone i think you're about
 the 23rd person that i've talked to total yeah and that includes uh you knowthe
 the newspapers and stuff and i've been selective because there's so much i meanif
 i turn down like i turned down russian tvuh i can give you her name when we're
 done here she called she not only called me she called my wife she called mydaughter she called my son and she
 called my son-in-law because they're persistent so i'm i'mpretty protect
 i'm very particular i mean the reason i'm talking to you is because i knew wewould have a conversation that wasn't
 based just on the tic tac in the incident but we can actually talk aboutsome of the science and some of the
 theoretical to get into to get more people involved to gobecause i think there's you know and
 when you talk to you know lou elizondo or chris mellon you know the group atttsa
 you know that that whole thing was that's to the starsuh academy okay that's the tom delonge
 group that got started so and you go well uh you know because ithink tom has caught a lot of crap for
 this but he's actually when you talk to him he's he's he's verysmart and i asked him how'd you get into
 this and he goes oh when i was traveling around with blink182 he goes you read a lot of books when
 you're laying in a van as you're driving to your next gigbefore you make it big and he goes and
 he read he was reading books and he read one of them on ufos i'm trying to thinkthe title that's one of the big ones
 that's out there real popular and so he started just hestarted asking more and through his fame
 with blink 182 in the band he got more and moreconnected you know if you talk to chris
 mellon who is an under secretary of defense forintelligence and he's part of the
 melon you know dynasty you know from carnegie mellon typevery very smart he knows he he he
 definitely knows how the government works because he worked thereand so when i went down to dc to talk to
 people he's one of the first people i'll go towhen i did uh
 tucker carlson about a month ago month and a half agoi asked i i he texts me i i texted him
 tom lu to go hey because they were like you got to do it because i turned to iturned tucker down a couple times before
 and his uh his producer had called me and i'm likeall right i'll do it because those guys
 like you gotta you gotta do this for us

1:49:15
Speaker 1 :so from my perspective just to give you
 some context so um to me there seems to be somestigma so i come from the scientific
 community and i really appreciate you talking to me todayand i think the people who listen to
 this include you know uh faculty fellow facultyat mit and major universities and it
 feels like there's some stigma to the subject from from the scientificcommunity
 a lot of people especially when they hear your story are like wow this isreally interesting
 but you you don't even know you one you're afraid to talk about it and twoyou don't know what the next steps are
 like how can we seriously try to think about what you sawhow to think about how we further look
 for things like it how we develop systems and plansfor how in the future we can
 immediately collect a lot more data and try to reactuh properly you know to try to
 communicate try to uh interpret this in in the best waypossible
 from a scientific perspective and i i just would love toremove stigma from this subject


1:50:31
Speaker 0 :uh well i think that's the first step we
 have done in this country an absolutely terriblejob with these things so you go
 and i joke you know go back to roswell so the first reports that came out ofroswell was we have this crash flying
 saucer that's literally what came out and thenmagically the next day
 it's a weather balloon and they're showing you pieces of mylar and you gowell that doesn't look like what they
 showed us yesterday then you get into project blue book youknow so there's that whole series about
 project blue book but the bottom line of project blue book is it really did twothings it investigated sightings
 and it did everything it could to debunk and disprove to the point where itactually went to discredit
 you know to make you look so there's always been thisthis i don't know if you'd call it an
 aura around it or a mystique about ufos that if you're talking about themthey're nuts
 with ours because i'm not a i'm not a you i'm not a ufo guy i'm not ajunkie if you ask me do i believe that
 there's life outside of earth i would say you probably have abetter chance of winning the mega ball
 lottery than we're the only planet that has lifeon it in the universe it's just
 the odds are against it if you do just do the mathyou have to accept because it if there
 only has to be one other planet that has life on itand then i win and you lose and then


1:51:47
Speaker 1 :more and more science has shown that
 there's habitable planets out there that yeah everything we've learned sofar and we know very little but
 everything we've learned so far about the planets out there exoplanetsearth-like planets it seems that it's
 very likely that there's life out thereintelligent life is another topic


1:52:09
Speaker 0 :but uh life well we we as humans you
 know and even more as americans we have thishubris about us that says
 are it and you go not so much

1:52:18
Speaker 1 :

1:52:20
Speaker 0 :we're not so intelligent um because we
 are it's just how we learn so you know our main mode of transportationand what people figured out you know
 years ago was the internal combustion engine which led us to jet engines andsolid rocket fuel what if you're in
 another planet where you didn't you figured outuh the ability to create a gravity field
 or you used you know because electromagnetics are becoming bigger andbigger and bigger you know catapults
 on ships were steam powered and the new gerald ford is electromagneticroller coasters used to use a chain to
 get you to the top of the hill now they shoot you with electromagnetics andyou're going
 so there's a whole new realm of propulsion that you know sometimes it'sour ability to develop the technology to
 support theory you know we are just now provingyou know recently theories that einstein
 had where people actually joked about them and now we actually have thetechnology to prove that gravity can
 bend light you know we have proven that so you lookat that when you go well does that mean
 that you know 70 years ago einstein was wrongor eight years ago einstein was wrong or
 do you go we just didn't have the ability to lookthat deep into space to actually find
 something that we could to actually measure and you know andi've seen and that's just a hundred


1:53:25
Speaker 1 :years and and the kind of things that
 can happen if you say

1:53:28
Speaker 0 :look what we've done in the last 20


1:53:30
Speaker 1 :years yeah it's crazy all right let me
 direct because it's such an interesting topicfrom a career perspective from a science
 perspective you're i mean you've spoke you've beenbrave
 in you know telling your story not some dramatic thing but just telling thethings you've seen
 did it encounter uh did it impact your careeris that why more people haven't come out
 like uh you've mentioned uh roswell like howwhat advice do you give to people to the
 community to me as a scientist for ways to go forward about this topicand
 still have a uh you know not being put in a bin in society that he's a loonor she's a loon or that person mine is


1:54:16
Speaker 0 :to get away from the little green men
 just divorce the two little green men and youknow and i've talked to lou elizano
 about this you know and and the group that they'reworking with which is incredible i mean
 they've got steve justice who used to run skunk works where theybuilt you know projects now louis and


1:54:33
Speaker 1 :she mentioned was a program director


1:54:36
Speaker 0 :he ran the a-tip program at the pentagon


1:54:37
Speaker 1 :and a-tip was a program that was tasked
 with investigating any kind of uh on ufo's uap

1:54:44
Speaker 0 :so what's funny is the unofficial
 official report that i joke about the guy who wrote the unofficialofficial report was actually an original
 member of atip and the original stuff that atip did wasfoia exempt
 and people how do you know that i go because i stood there with the memo inmy hand that said these are
 did literally i watched the dod memo that said it and it was signedso he was one so that's why the that's
 why i call it the unofficial official report it was neverit was never releasable because people
 go oh i put in a foil request and i didn't get that i go well just becauseyou put an effort requesting get it i go
 because how much how much time do you think thatguy is going to spend to get you the
 information that you requested if you can't find iti actually got called by the navy i had
 a commander in a navy call me about uhright before the article came out in the
 new york times it was this was starting to come backand she had called me because there's
 been there was a foia request for stuff about the nimitz incident and i saiddo you know of anything she called me
 she goes do you know of anything else besides thethe situation reports that come off the
 ship you know and you gotta remember when the situation report comes off theship that's like
 third hand so we tell someone they tell someone that person has to write it upso there's all kinds of inaccuracies in
 it but then there's the unofficial officialreport that's actually pretty well
 written there's some errors in it but it was you know i didn't help write it ijust
 did it and he did a really good job of researching it and figuring out who'swho in the zoo and the players
 um so she called me and said is there anything out there and i saidofficially out there she said yes i said
 i don't know anything i knew of the unofficial official reportwhich is that one but i'm not you know
 if you don't know about it i'm not going to tell you because it's not my job

1:56:20
Speaker 1 :and nor did i care i mean did
 in that whole situation you mentioned lube i mean did youthink about your impact your career like
 just to get back to the question did do you thinkothers other pilots
 other thing other people like in rooseveltare thinking about this kind of thing
 why aren't they talking about this why are people afraid to talk about this

1:56:42
Speaker 0 :well honestly the military and the press
 there's a distrust i'll just tell you that right nowwe typically don't like talking to the
 press because if i talk to you you know especially when i do even thetv shows you know because i've been on a
 couple shows when you look at it you know they cometo my house and they film me for two
 hours yeah and then what you see on the screenis five minutes


1:57:03
Speaker 1 :well and yeah and the other thing with
 the press let me give you my perspective from autonomous vehiclesis the clipping happens
 yes but also the incompetence let me just call out journals

1:57:15
Speaker 0 :they're not thinking i mean so so here's


1:57:19
Speaker 1 :the thing
 i've i have a phd and i've taken painfully too many classes from likephysics and math and i also have a deep
 curiosity about the world i read a lot that seems to be missingwith journalism so you're talking to a
 person who's not gonna push the story forward in an interestingway not the story but the
 actual investigation of uh perhaps one of the most amazing thingsthat humans have witnessed in history
 like you it might have been nothing who knowswhat you witnessed might have been from
 a sort of debunking perspective might have been some kind of trick of mineif you and others have hallucinated
 something it could be some simple explanationbut possibly it was
 uh something not of this world and to not do justice to this storyfrom a scientific perspective it seems
 at best negligence and so yeah that's true forjournalists it's true for others we it's


1:58:24
Speaker 0 :just
 it's human nature yeah if we if we can't if we see something that we can'texplain
 then sometimes if you just yeah maybe it's just me and you let it go awayand you don't think about it you know
 maybe it'll just you know it's it's you ignore it um the other side isthe inquisitive mind that says well what
 was that and i wanna i wanna dig more into ityou know and if you you you look at it
 or you're going against the norm um you can get ostracized you know andif you look at you know
 einstein's the perfect example i mean he started coming up with some of histheories
 some of the top physicists in the world were like dude you'reyou're a nut job and he's he's literally
 proving them but he didn't have you know he provedhim in theory
 but he didn't have the means to actually do the experiment to prove

1:59:12
Speaker 1 :his theory there's a great book that i
 recommend people read called proving einstein rightby jim gates that talks about like
 the hard work that people try to do years afterto try to experimentally validate
 the predictions that einstein made with uh with his theoriesit's fascinating but yes at the time
 it's kind of crazy

1:59:36
Speaker 0 :what he's saying yeah if you look at it
 back at the time don't we we look at it now and go well the guy was a walkinggenius and he was
 but if you go back in time when he was doing it it was like what are youtalking about


1:59:47
Speaker 1 :you know but one of the challenges is
 your eyewitness one of the challenges is you'reessentially an eyewitness account like
 we don't have good data we have very limited data of um of theincident that you've experienced
 so let me kind of dig in let me just ask some questionsof uh maybe to see if there's
 just to paint more and more of the picture one you kind of mentioned so tictac
 shape let's break apart two situations one is the videolet's look at the actual eye account the
 the eyewitness account that you saw with your own eyeswhat's the what can you say about the
 shape of the thing is there interesting aspects outside of the tic taclike is there any appendages is there um
 some texture to it that no

2:00:36
Speaker 0 :smooth white tic tac
 no we don't you don't see there's no no wingsno visible propulsion no windows
 no probes that we could see we don't notice like i said we don't see thelittle things on the bottom of it until
 we see the video in the tv mode when it's zoomed inright before it's shortly you kind of
 see them zoom in you don't see it typically on the youtube stuff that'sout there
 um but remember we're looking at the original tape so there's not there'sbasically no degradation but when you


2:01:09
Speaker 1 :saw your eyes there's no kind of
 appendages no no what about like somebody asked a lotof people asked you questions so
 i appreciate you spending your time here let me ask some of themuh did you i mean you chased it so we
 flew close to it relatively speaking was there did youfeel any wake
 like any did you feel it in any way in terms of your interaction likeaerodynamically no
 nothing nothing so uh another aspect of it there's aninteresting thing you've developed a
 feel for for objects in the air did youfeel like it was surprised by your
 arrival or did it let me ask a few questions around it sodid you did it feel like the thing was
 surprised did it feel like it wanted to be seenalmost to show off its capability did
 uh and did it what did it feel like relative to if you were doing aum an air fight against uh sort of
 like a i don't know a a foreign

2:02:19
Speaker 0 :jet so one i think it
 i think it knew we were there when we showed up it's just it'sme uh it's kind of like an animal if
 you've ever been around deer in a field you know the deer will look up and if itsees you and you're on the other side of
 the field it'll actually go no threat and it'llstart eating you know they don't put
 their tail up because you move closer to the deer then it goes oh it's there andi'm going to react or i'm going to move
 so as we were up high and it's down doing whatever it was doingum you know which i don't know someone
 asked what do you think oh maybe it was communicating with something i joked ongood morning america maybe it's like
 talking to the whales kind of like star trek you knowand i actually used that clip it was


2:02:57
Speaker 1 :kind of funny but yeah we're a little
 human-centric we think like it would it show up totalk to us but maybe he's talking to the
 dolphins maybe

2:03:04
Speaker 0 :it was whatever you know because it was
 hanging around that white water and i don't know ifwas there something there was a seamoth
 we just didn't find it again i don't knowbut once we started the descent and it
 actually reoriented its longitudinal axis and it startedmirroring us coming up and it was
 obviously where we were there and it was really coming up just you know youfigure i'm at 20 and it's
 coming up and it ends up getting up to 12. uhwhere i cut across the circle i think it
 was very aware that we were there because it interacted we call it atwo-circle fight when you're fighting
 another airplane um but uh you knowwas it was were we afraid i don't think
 so i mean and to me it was more curious youknow the curiosity overcomes any fear
 that you would have and i always felt to be honestif i was inside the airplane uh
 especially as long as much times i'd spent inside the airplane flying anddoing stuff
 i felt totally it was like a safe zone i mean i i felt totally comfortableinside the airplane as most part you
 can't if you're in the airplane and you feelscared it's not the job for you you have
 to feel that because the airplane is part of you nowyes you know i am inside i have the
 stick i have the throttles i've got my wizard in the back seat he's running allthe displays
 we are a team we're in the state-of-the-artairplane you know brand new you feel
 pretty good and then you get something that you knowcan climb from the surface up and then
 accelerate like it did like it was like no big dealyou know for an airplane if you just put
 me from a standstill let's just say slow flight just get me at 100 knotsabove the water and for me to you can't
 just start a climb i'd have to lower the nose i'd have to accelerate and then i'dhave to start coming up and
 this thing just like just did it like it was like no big deal yeah you mentioned

2:04:45
Speaker 1 :that
 like you kind of your reaction to it was uh itlike it's something that you would love
 to fly almost uh so this object just the curiosity youexperience is like
 like what it almost like what the heck is that piece of technology and i wantto fly it
 like what made you feel like it's something that you could flydo you think it's something that a human
 could fly like in terms of interpreting what yousaw as a piece of technology
 because another perspective on it is it wasuh not that the thing under the water
 was the key thing and what you were seeingis some kind of projection or something
 that like

2:05:31
Speaker 0 :i don't think it was a projection i


2:05:33
Speaker 1 :think it was a real object it was an a
 physical hard object that would could be flied oh yeah yeah i

2:05:37
Speaker 0 :think
 all four of us will say the same thing it wasn't it wasn't this was not becauseyou go
 okay let's just go on it's a light projectionwell if we were both sitting next to
 each other we were looking at it from the exact same angle and all that and igo oh okay there's a
 in theory you could have that but with an 8 000 foot altitude difference flyingyou know and they're you know she's
 probably not directly above me she's kind of hanging out watching this wholething happen
 you know you're getting two different perspectives from two differentaltitudes over a clear blue
 you know if you've ever been at sea and i don't mean like coastal i mean likewhen you get out at sea the ocean is the
 bluest it's incredible um you know you got a bright whiteobject
 over a deep blue ocean you got pretty high contrastand for this thing just to disappear uh
 it's it's was i'm telling you i would i mean i know we we all have the sameuh recollection of what happened you
 know there's some details because it's so long ago butfor the most part we know what we saw
 and we all came back and looked at each other like what the hell was that

2:06:40
Speaker 1 :what if i mean do you think about the
 thing under the water that's not often talked aboutif there's something under the water
 couldn't have been something gigantic like it could be what like do you ever

2:06:52
Speaker 0 :see this


2:06:54
Speaker 1 :big ship that's why as a person so i
 love like swimming out into the ocean my mom's anolympic swimmer so like i love that
 feeling but i'm also terrified when i swimbecause the abyss anything could be
 under there i like there's not enough focus on thatperhaps because there's no visibility
 but is it is there anything interesting to sayabout the possibility there was
 anything underneath there it could be i

2:07:16
Speaker 0 :mean think about if you're going to hide
 on this planet where's what's the least explored spot on theplanet two-thirds of it's the ocean
 you there's there's there's literally i mean come onthe the the malaysia airplane the the
 triple seven it was a triple seven that crashed you know they turned they didn'tgo where they're supposed to and they
 just disappeared and they've been searching for it and they found piecesof it
 but you would think there's large objects that you know when that thinghit the water
 depending on how it broke up there's big pieces that would you'd find somethingthey haven't found anything except what
 floated um so to hide something underwater ithink would be easy


2:07:54
Speaker 1 :so okay let's go a little bit in
 speculation land but it's the best it's the best we can dowhich is
 the basic question of what do you think was it so if you had to put money on itis it uh like advanced human created
 technology is it alien technology is it an unknownphysical phenomena
 you know like a ball lightning for example there's a lot of fascinatingthings that
 humans don't really understand is it uh like i said some perception cognitionthat led you
 uh some kind of hallucination that made you to misinterpret the things you wereseeing
 let me put those things on the table or is it misinterpretation of some knownphysical phenomena like uh like an ice
 cloud or something like that

2:08:40
Speaker 0 :what do you think it was well it's
 definitely i don't think it's an ice cloud because ice clouds don't flyaround
 yep and react to you do i think it was a lighti'd say no because of the aspects and
 what we looked and watched it do i'd say no what do you mean by light

2:08:53
Speaker 1 :

2:08:54
Speaker 0 :like a light ball
 you know some type of perception you know there's uhtheir experience like plasma you can do
 plasma and you go i can see it but it's really not youknow it's plasma i don't think so
 um so you would see distortions i think is it movedmaybe not i mean i'm not the theoretical
 physicist in some you know you know i'm not in mit uhi would say no i mean it looked for from
 all my experience and and i had quite a bit of it when thishappened
 no i i think it was a it was a hard object it be it was aware that we werethere
 it reacted exactly like if i was another airplaneand i had to come up and do something
 exactly what i would do you know it mirrored me it wasn'taggressive you know there was taco it
 fought behind us and never it was never offensive on usit never did that it just mirrored us so
 as we're coming out it's just like you knowyou're you're kind of you know you said
 you do martial arts you know or wrestlingyou know you see people out on the the
 uh when they get into the ring especially with collegiate wrestlingbecause my roommate in college was a
 collegiate wrestler so i de facto became a wrestler because he hebeat me up every night yeah
 we joke i talk to him literally probably three four times a weekum but you know you see wrestlers when
 they get out they kind of you're kind of feeling each other as you walkboxers do the same thing it was doing
 that same thing it's like what's going on as it comes around as it comes aroundand then it was like hey we're going to
 get here and when i got too close to it you know it decided i'm out of here andthen it did something that we've never
 seen the other question is what if i didn'tcut across the circle what if i just
 kept going around a circle

2:10:25
Speaker 1 :we just keep going but i could have just


2:10:27
Speaker 0 :watched it i mean my one regret out of
 the whole thing is uh we have a camera in our helmet in thejoint helmet there's a little camera but
 we never use it because it's nauseating to watch because you've ever put a goproon someone's head where they're looking
 around like this all the time it'll it'll nauseate you so we never turn thaton and all you know it's the one thing i
 didn't do is reach down and hit the switchyeah you know and then we didn't go back
 and because our tapes didn't have anything because we didn't get it onradar
 um because i tried to lock it up because i can move the radar with my head but icouldn't
 it wouldn't lock the radar would lock and so

2:10:58
Speaker 1 :so then the question is and this is
 unanswerable but let's try did you get some hints at it do youthink it's human
 like advanced human created technology that'ssimply top secret that we're just not
 aware of or is it not something not of this world

2:11:18
Speaker 0 :so you if you'd asked me in 2004
 i just said i don't know if you ask me nowso we're coming up on 16 years ago
 for a technology like that you know and let's assume that it didn't have aconventional propulsion system in it
 because i don't think it did i would like to think that if we had atechnology that would advance mankind
 leaps and bounds from what we normally dothen it would start coming out but to
 hide something like that for 16 years you know and i understand uh you knowand i don't speak for the united states
 government i never will speak for the united statesgovernment but i understand how some of
 that stuff works for classification levels and why we classify stuff youknow is it
 is it detrimental to national defense but there's a point where you have tolook and go
 if we had a technology like this that could literally change the waymankind travels how we get things into
 space our ability to do things you know youtalk about you know are we gonna go to
 mars well if you have something that has the ability to gobecause remember these things were
 coming down when the cruiser tracked them from above 80 000 feet which isspace and they would come down and they
 would come straight down they'd hang out at like 20 000 feet and thenthree or four hours later they'd go back
 up we don't have anything that can come down hang out in onceyou know and i'm talking hold out in a
 spot well we all know there's winds they're not drifting like a balloonthey're just sitting there
 and then they would go back up and they tracked up to thewhen i talked to the controller he's
 like we've seen up to 10 of these things there's other guys and it was rainingand all this other let's just say they
 tracked a groups of these things coming downhanging out and going up


2:12:55
Speaker 1 :so it's not just propulsion and the way
 it moves it's also fuel it's everything so the whole thewhole of it indicates
 of a kind of technology that's uh highly advanced but you don't think inyour sense
 that you actually don't know but you know more thana lot of people in your sense the
 top secret military technology if you think about skunk works if you thinkabout like that
 cannot be more than 15 years ahead

2:13:25
Speaker 0 :i would say for a leap like that and and
 a perfect example in modern times is the 117.because now a lot of the data on the 117
 is out like it was developed at this timeit flew for this long before it was
 actually acknowledged by the united states government what's the 117. that'sthe stealth fighter
 the original stealth fighter not the b-2 but the stealth fighter soyou look at that you know yeah you can i
 think you can hide things for a while um but i think a technology a leap imean this is not
 this is not a hey we developed this and we'rekind of pushing the edge of technology
 this is a giant leap in technology you know and the other one is do we havethe basis to do that you know
 because usually when you have a technology like that universitiesespecially the one you're working at mit
 a lot of the leading edge stuff is coming out of the top tier universitiesyou know so you've got mit you've got
 caltech you've got stanford georgia tech virginia techcarnegie mellon i'm just naming schools
 naval post graduate school is another onethere's usually indicators there's
 papers of hey this is where we're going i don't think there's a whole bunch ofpapers on developing a
 gravity-based propulsion system that literallyi've got an object because how do you
 how much power would it cost to create a gravity field of yourown
 that could actually be strong enough to counter the giant orb that we live on

2:14:47
Speaker 1 :so by the way you mentioned
 gravity-based that's kind of like the hypothesizing that people do in terms ofuh
 propulsion like what kind of propulsion would have to uhwould have to be involved in order to
 result in that kind of movement to me all the gravity discussions justseems insane uh from a physics
 perspective but of course uh it would seem insane uh until

2:15:13
Speaker 0 :it's not but because remember we only
 know what we know

2:15:16
Speaker 1 :yeah and and which is very little and


2:15:19
Speaker 0 :someone has relatively
 think out of the box to go is this possible at all yeah well okay

2:15:26
Speaker 1 :so this
 so you're you're saying that if you had to bet money all your moneyit would be something that's
 alien technology so it's not human-created technology well i don't

2:15:37
Speaker 0 :like to get into little green men but i
 would say that i don't i don't think people development right idon't think we've developed it
 i just you know because the other one someone had asked me they said what ifthere wasn't
 maybe it was just a drone maybe it was a uavthat got sent here from someplace else
 i mean we've got stuff out there flying around umso i don't i don't know i mean i'd like
 to sit around and talk to some of the giant brains that think this stuff up iwas supposed to be on a podcast with one
 of them

2:16:07
Speaker 1 :uh but such topic which uh you mean look
 for drones for

2:16:11
Speaker 0 :just uh just space travel technology
 because if you look at where we're going you know because everyone talks aboutmars
 you okay and you know we're hey are we gonna be able to colonize you know and iknow elon is big into that you know yeah


2:16:22
Speaker 1 :what do you think about
 what do you think about elon spacex nasa we put humansback up uh back up there my theory


2:16:29
Speaker 0 :so it's funny because i i know one of
 the guys that was he was he was one of the originalemployees at spacex he's a friend of
 mine and i won't say his name but he knowselon yeah he knows elon and uh
 yeah and he actually worked on the entire falcon one project he's one ofthe lead guys on that so he's got some
 great matter of fact he's there's a moviethere's a book coming out that comes out
 in about a year on this the original the first years of spacefor six years of spacex
 you know and he's named in the book you know and they're supposed to make amovie on it so i'm like hey who's gonna
 play it um but uh what he's done to me itchanged the game and here's why
 because i said you know in i think it was 62 and eisenhower warned of theindustrial defense complex you know
 which it has become everything he warned us ofyou know
 it has become and it's really driven by there's the big three in defense whichis really you know northrop
 lockheed and boeing those are the big those are yourbiggest raytheon's kind of write like a
 subset of that but they're raytheon's pretty big too big in u.sdefense those are the big guys
 right that's actually where a lot of military guys go when they retire theygo to stuff like that so
 um when you look at that and you go and the way government contracting isworking and how we charge and
 you know why things cost so much and then you go you gotelon who's got an ego you know and he
 doesn't like to do things certain way and i've talked to the guy that workedthere
 on you know because the government likes to have oversight of contracts where hewas like no
 just tell me what you want i'll build it i'll give you a bill when it's done andthen
 if i do it for half the price i make a ton of money because he's money-drivenguy
 which i like capitalism at its best so now you look at the two things so yougot the the spacex which is the dragon
 capsule right and then you've got boeing so elondid what boeing is contracted to do in
 less time for half the money and oh by the way because he can reusethe boosters because they come back and
 land and you don't have to like morton thigh call we reused them on the spaceshuttle
 but they had to take them all apart and do a bunch of stuff because they landedin salt water and then you had to put
 them all back together where elon gets them down because i wasjoking with this guy go what do they do
 they like re rehaul you know overhaul because noactually they clean them up and they can
 use them again they're reusable systems incredible leap in technologythat no one thought of but here's a
 private company so being able to put people on in the capsule and thespacesuits i mean it's literally like
 sci-fi when you watch when they went up so i'm a huge fan ofwhat he
 and his company have been able to do because you know the fact that we werepaying huge amounts of money
 to the russian government you know and oh by the way if you didn't know becausei have some friends that are astronauts
 uh they all have to learn russian right they have to and they have to do it'swhat level five where the test is a
 phone call yeah where they call you up and they youknow because they would go
 so i went to the pinning two two friends of mine the one actually had a missiondate the one got one later so it's cool
 when you're watching your friends doing a space walkyou know because i would pull up because
 if i knew what was going on i'd pull up the nasa thing i was in a meeting oneday and i've got nasa on
 and and makers out there floating around you know doing his stuff and i saw onehe's in the space station while they're
 doing a spacewalk so it's kind of cool when you go oh yeah i know that dudehe's up there in space floating around
 um so when you when you look at what those they're capable of doing and thenyou go
 what elon is bringing to the fact that nowit's back in america it's actually
 to me it's it's cost effective for us to be able to do more stuffi think it opens the door to do we go
 back to the moon is there a reason to go back to the moon personally i think ifwe're gonna if they're really gonna go
 you know in years from now go to mars i think that the moon is the steppingstone to go back
 to start proving some of the technology to go hey we can build this we can geton the moon
 and now we can get back off the moon uh because we did this on a less than acompact computer in the 60s which is the
 whole reason that i flew because i'm obsessed matter of fact i have the giantlego
 apollo at home and the lander and i have one that my dad built me in 1969right after that and neil armstrong's an
 ohio boy and so am i matter of fact i have a picture of himin a car in wapicanet ohio at the parade
 after he walked on the moon because his parents didn't live far from my auntuncle in wapa kineta and they were out
 at the parade so i've been obsessed with this since iwas a child


2:20:48
Speaker 1 :do you hope to uh do you think do you
 hope that you'll go out to the space one day

2:20:54
Speaker 0 :me if i had the opportunity i'd go in a
 second you know

2:20:59
Speaker 1 :i am not i mean that's one of the hopes
 of the commercial space flight is that you know uh like people like i mean itwould be to us
 tourism but you certainly wouldn't want to in terms of you're nowkind of a civilian right i mean in a
 sense that you're just a normal person you're not a fighter pilotcurrently but it seems like if we send a
 civilian up there would be somebody like youin the next like 20 years i i'd be


2:21:23
Speaker 0 :you know if elon wants to throw me one
 of those things i'd be all over i don't know what my wife would say but you knowsometimes you gotta
 you gotta get your kicks while you're

2:21:31
Speaker 1 :alive i'd love to hear that discussion
 with your wife listen there's the pros and cons

2:21:34
Speaker 0 :uh she's she's i mean i've known she's
 on board high school so she yeah she knows how i am you know mostpeople that know me are like yeah you're
 pretty much the same person you were in high schoolyou know i was a class clown and i still
 am that way

2:21:47
Speaker 1 :um so let me ask you this question about
 so i'm talking to elon again soon i'm curious to get your perspective onit
 if i wanted to talk to him about tic tac aboutthese weird out there propulsion
 ideas which are obviously just like you said if there's something to itif it can be investigated somehow it
 would be extremely useful for us to understand in the effort ofdeveloping
 propulsion systems that can get us cheaply to out to spacewhat what should elon think about this
 stuff what should he do what should people like him i think

2:22:25
Speaker 0 :people need to open their aperture up
 and stay off of uh take the next step and goyou know we are tied to fuels and either
 solid rocket or liquid you know whatever we do but it's it's athrust generated where we rapidly expand
 gas to create thrust which is really in layman's terms youknow we can get into what but
 that's what it does um if you have something thatyou can contain that is a as a fuel
 source that would last a significant amount of time you knowthose rocket boosters go and when
 they're done they're done there's enough to get them back down and that's itthere's not a huge
 you know not coming back and go well i still got three quarters of a tank let'shold him on and do it again
 his system's not doing that um but you know the way the way contractingespecially in the government the
 government has tons of money but you got to rememberthe government has to justify how they
 spend our tax dollars for the most part there's times where they canhide money in the budget to get stuff
 done but then when you look at and i'm just going to throw a few out there butif you look at
 what amazon you know does with bezos and you've gotelon um there's some there's some big
 money out there yeah i mean you're talking you knowbezos alone could buy
 companies like big companies apple is another onethese companies had huge huge amounts of
 money and then just go over to the gatesfoundation and they've got
 gazillions and gazillions of dollars we've got universities there's so muchmoney out there if we
 really wanted to do it aside from what the government wants to do because we dolive in a free society
 i think there's enough to go how do we do this andbecause when you work outside of what
 the government would want to do let's so let's let's we're not workingon this necessarily for the united
 states although i am a huge giant i will be americani would never yeah i am an american


2:24:19
Speaker 1 :you're talking to somebody born in the
 soviet union i can't believe you agreed to this um

2:24:22
Speaker 0 :but
 but when i you know haven't killed me yetyeah well you're here yeah and you've
 been here for a while

2:24:32
Speaker 1 :no no i'm joking i'm i'm an american
 citizen i'm actually pretty much american too when you do that so you

2:24:36
Speaker 0 :look at let's just look at american
 universities yes so there's some brilliant minds andwe'll just use mit because you work down
 there there's some brilliant minds but there'sa huge chunk of those brilliant minds
 that are not american citizens so if you want to get intogovernment stuff and you are not an
 american citizen it gets really really really hardbut if i take money like bezos money
 elon money and they let's just say they want towork together they can split it up 50 50
 the two of them when the technology gets developedbut now i'm not constrained by who has
 to do the work i just want to make sure that i try and keep it in the unitedstates because
 technology is technology and if it gets developed and gets over to whereyou know a country gets a hold of it and
 then just basically uses it for their own because you save them all theresearch time
 you don't want to do that but if we can get to the point where we can we do iton the international space station we
 realized that space was too expensive for one country to do alone so we madethe international space station and we
 have a conglomerate it's the one thing thatthe russians and the u.s
 actually work together on think about it that's it we work together on spacebecause we realize it's way too
 expensive for us to do alone and effective so we've got this thingthat's been out there floating around
 for god now what is it like 20 years that thing's been up there floatingaround
 so it's getting old we're gonna have to replace parts and do stuff butif we can pull the money together and
 come up with a something that would literally change mankind and changetravel and allow us to actually do a
 more effective thing of exploring because if you develop that technologyi'm not you don't even have to send a
 man person if you can develop a technology that'sso and with our automation and we're
 progressing in our our computing power to send somethingout that's not just floating around when
 you know that it can react a lot quicker somethingthat could actually go down to the
 surface and come back up so right now everything we get out of mars it goesdown there and then it just sends data
 back it analyzes it but i've got a technologythat can go up there really quick i'm
 not worried about man i don't have life support systems and all that but it cango down it can go it can cruise around
 it can hover above it can take samples and it can actually take martian soiland then bring it
 back yeah so we can analyze it here that's a game changerit's a complete game changer because it
 opens up all the planets

2:26:44
Speaker 1 :exactly so in the sense the the the tic
 tac is a symbol so uh whatever you thinkeven from a debunking perspective
 there's a non-zero probability that it's alien technologyand in that sense it serves as a
 beacon of hope and a reason to like you said widen the aperture andto invest
 big amounts of money into thinking outside the box likeit's almost uh a hope
 to say we can do better propulsion we can overcome physics in an order ofmagnitude better way
 and it's worthwhile to try i think and i

2:27:26
Speaker 0 :don't think the money
 if you look at the big picture with the amount of money some that's out therefloating around these private companies
 you know i think if you said hey i've got let's just say a hundred milliondollars which really a hundred million
 dollars relative to bezos has got 100 and some billiondollars in the network so if he said hey
 100 100 million dollars you drop 100 million dollars and i goand i'm gonna put a you know like the
 government will send a broad area announcement out that sayshey we're looking for this technology or
 a darpa program but what if i just said hey who's tostop bezos and elon from doing that on
 their own to say hey i want to go pool universities becausethey have fewer restrictions because
 it's not tax dollars they don't have the checks and bound they can do whateverthey want it's their money
 oh sorry about that um to go hey i'm going to put this out and i'm going toget the best
 physicists that are working at cern that are at mit that are at caltech at theschools i mentioned and
 oh by the way a few of these guys are propulsion experts and i'm going tobasically
 i'm going to fund you guys for 10 years so you get 10 million a year and i'mgonna give your salaries and we're gonna
 do that or whatever the amount works so let's cut it down to five so we can paywell
 right to do the research but oh by the way the research isit's not classified but it's controlled
 so we're not gonna publicly just put this out in journals but if we make aleap
 that we think would advance because although those let's say there's 10 ofthem
 those 10 scientists come up with something and they put out a paperthere might be another a number 11 at
 another university that reads that paper and says heyi kind of had this idea and now you can
 get a thought pool that pushes us in and gets us out of the the mindsetbecause we have a tendency to
 we evolve the stuff that we create but yeah it's like i was joking because youknow i
 i know a ton of guys with phds and girls and i said but you know how much when aperson gets a phd in like engineering
 how much new math is really being done i saidthere's a handful of people in the world
 that are really doing i'm talking i'm talking stephen hawkins typebrilliance that is going
 i'm really doing something that's yeah that's totally

2:29:25
Speaker 1 :different that's a big dramatic thing
 now going on in physics that everyone is just everybody's conversed towardsthis local minima or
 local maximum whatever you think about it and it's it's againsame as with the tic tac thinking
 outside the box is not is uh not accepted and it probablyshould be


2:29:45
Speaker 0 :but it's hard because if you go back go
 back to einstein back to the original he was the he wasout of the box
 yeah he did not think that the true jesus had he notthought out of the box and came up with
 some of his theories where would we be

2:30:00
Speaker 1 :okay we're jumping around a little bit
 so we talked a little bit about elon and mars and space but let's uhlet me jump back to a few questions that
 folks had i have to kind of bring up somedebunking stuff because i think
 not the actual idea not the actual facts of the debunkingbut the nature of the true believers
 versus the debunkers hurts my heart a little bit becausepeople are just talking past each other
 but let me kind of bring it up uh mick west i've just recently started to payattention
 just in preparing to talk to you about this world and mick west is one of thebetter known people who kind of makes a
 a career out of trying to debunk sort of he's ahis natural approach to all situations
 is that of a skeptic i think it's it's veryuseful and powerful especially for me
 coming from a scientific perspective to take the approach he does it'svaluable and
 i think no matter what i think there's i hope that peoplequote unquote true believers are a
 little bit more open minded to the work of mick west i thinkit's quite useful
 and brilliant work so let me ask uh here's a bunch of videos a bunch ofideas where he kind of suggests possible
 other explanations of the things that were out therehe has some explanations of the things
 that you've seen in it with the tic tac like with yourown eyes like
 he says that uh it's possible that you miscalculatedthe size and the distance of the thing
 and so on when you were flying around i don't fight that as uh i mean maybeyou can comment on that person let me do


2:31:41
Speaker 0 :it right now sure
 so because that comes up like how how did you know it was about 40 feet long igo
 okay so 16 years flying against other airplanesknow what stuff looks like you know i've
 looked down on things so if i know i know here's the known things i know whenwe saw the tic tac i was at
 20 000 feet pish right around there so when i look downi know what a hornet looks like looking
 down on him because i've done it for all those years i mean i got a good ideaso that's that's why i said 40 feet
 because it's about hornet size so and as i go around you you get to thepoint where you have to be able to judge
 distance when we fly out of experience and you can tell if somethingsmall or big you know so i would argue
 the fact of you know peer experience there's youknow
 professional observers which is what we're actually trained to doum and having done it for so long
 no it was and everyone came back with the same thing they're like yeah i wasabout size of hornet


2:32:39
Speaker 1 :from a human factors perspective how
 often in your experience of those 16 yearsdo you find that eyes what you see
 is the incorrect state of things so like how often do you make mistakes

2:32:56
Speaker 0 :with vision you actually you make vision
 issues a lot because you're and the sad part is your brain believes what youreyes see
 we are actually trained to do the opposite of that especially when youinstrument fly because
 your brain and eyes can tell you one thing but you got to trust yourinstruments let's
 let's go back to landing at night so

2:33:17
Speaker 1 :your


2:33:19
Speaker 0 :you're right i eyes that the runway and
 your brain assumes that the runway is fixed but youknow
 that the runway is moving so if i try and do stuff visually i would you dieevery time
 not every time but you die close to every time trying to land on a boatso we actually use instruments which are
 counter to your brain so and there's actually all kinds of thingsthat we go through in training
 they have this thing i think they still use it it's called the msddmulti-spatial disorientation device
 or the spin and puke it looks like a giantcarousel and you're in these little
 modules and when you get out you think the thing goes really fast and they canyou can make yourself think that i'm
 descending or climbing but you're actually only going around in circles ata very slow rate as fast as a human can
 talk but as they spin you around in a little sub thingand slow it down and speed it up your
 body does this and you you know and then byvisuals of showing you like they can
 spin it sideways to the outside wall but they can show like lines that arethey can make the line stand still
 because they're moving the same velocity they can move the other way and you'llthink you're screaming
 you see it in amusement parks all the time umyou you do all that because it gives you
 a sense of the a but you're really not doing you'resitting there so we get trained on all
 that stuff so if you if you want to look at it and go wellyou're you're disoriented or this side
 bill i'd argue going no i'm not because you know when i'm flying the airplaneeven as i'm looking at the tic tac i've
 got a heads-up display that tells me what my airplane's doingso i've got i know what i'm doing i can
 look outside i've got a sense of what i'm doing but i'm also looking inside tocross
 check of what i'm seeing is in reality

2:34:51
Speaker 1 :what i'm doing you actually your brain
 gotten good at combining almost adding extra sensory informationyou have to
 you have like supervision so you're combining what you're seeingand adjusting what the sensors what
 you're calling the instruments you're giving youand that that in turn is a loop that
 adjusts the perception system that like thatthat adjusts your brain's interpretation
 of what you're saying yeah you'd be

2:35:13
Speaker 0 :amazed at how good so here's
 here's another example so if we go out over the water so there's no land insight
 and we're gonna fight so when we fight you know two airplanes we're gonnadog fight as an instructor
 and i was for all most of my time you have to come back and you have torecreate it so we we call it drawing
 arrows so um you have to recreate that stuffso you get pretty good at going you know
 like i would take off and say all right we're starting headingdue east uh and i know where the sun is
 at because in the short couple minuteswe're going to fight the sun's really
 not going to move much it's going to be an irrelevance so now i know that thesun
 is at you know let's just say 195 degreesright so i'm starting going east and
 it's actually be down off my right hand sideso now i know as i'm fighting because in
 the water you don't have any reference like oh i passed land i passed like noyou don't and you can't use clouds
 because clouds do move but you got to come back because you gohere's where i started and then you when
 as soon as you end you go all right i ended heading355. and then you recreate the turns and
 the amount of turns and use the sun relative so you can create this entirebattle that went on with arrows so you
 can come back and debrief the guy that you were teachingon exactly what happened and you get
 really really good at that so when you come up and go well dave how do you knowyou were at six o'clock and he went
 around and he came up here i go because i'm trained to do all that and itake all the notes
 while i'm flying you can do it and but usually it's you memorize it alland you get done and then you re you as
 soon as you're done you knock it off you look at the other airplane you get setand you start writing all your notes
 down yeah and you're writing it really faston your card you go out the stack of
 cards and you stick a new one on your knee board card so you're ready to goand here's the next setup


2:36:54
Speaker 1 :um it's kind of it's in some way
 similar to what uh like at the at the highest level chess players doi mean you're i mean


2:37:04
Speaker 0 :

2:37:06
Speaker 1 :they they they recap the games but the
 the richness of the representation that they useand remembering like how the games
 evolved it's not like it's much richer than theactual moves
 it's like these a bunch of patterns that are hard to put into words likelike all the richness of thinking
 they have about the way the game evolved it's more likeinstinctual from years and years of
 experience so they try to put it into words butthey really can't it's


2:37:37
Speaker 0 :it's just not i understand that it's
 because for us if we don't come back with anything thenthere's no learning to be had right
 because the whole thing is the debrief when we get back and we talkabout that's really where the learning
 is um and it's the same thing if you wantto go back to chess you know when you
 start off you try and learn because you'reremembering what you're doing if you
 play against someone i'm always a big placeplay with someone better than you that's
 how you learn if you're constantly beating people you're not learninganything you're just learning that
 they're not good and you're better when you when you challenge yourselfagainst someone that is going to
 is better than you you learn so i learned how to fight an airplanewith he's actually one of my best
 friends uh we'll call him tom i won't give hiscall sign because i don't know he wasn't
 so tom took me out and taught me how to fight uh becausetom had just left hopkins he was the the
 training officer top gun which so that's the guy yeah the training officeris the main guy at top gun
 so tom was a training officer top gun so tom when i learned because i come out ofa6 and we really don't fight because it
 was a bomber so i get in f-18s and i want to learnhow to fight because it's a whole other
 side of the mission it's the f and f fighter attack the f a-18 is fighterattack so i
 had to learn how to fight so now i got one of the best fighter pilots in theworld
 who's going to teach me how to do it and he did and i woulddo something and then he would go i'd
 get to a situation where i had never been and then i would go well i'm gonnado this and then he would destroy me and
 he would come back and go here's why you don't do that and then i would take thatknowledge and i would put it in my
 little basket of tricks and over time because you know no onewalks out into that world i don't care
 how gifted of an aviator and go i i am the man yeah or the woman i'm ityeah
 no it's a learning process and so over

2:39:16
Speaker 1 :all those years you've gotten good so
 i mean so what are the chances that your eyesbetrayed you
 when you saw the tic-tac

2:39:29
Speaker 0 :low zero well i mean i'm not zero so
 okay yeah i am 99.9 so 0.1 my eyes deceive me but rememberif it deceived me it had to deceive the
 other four people so the percentage is even lower

2:39:46
Speaker 1 :yeah okay well i i don't find that that
 particular debunking case that you saw but i'm glad you put ityou um you said those words out loud
 so for me from my perspective uh coming into this world and looking at iti'm a little bit more skeptical uh so
 your eye account i think is the most fascinating storyand that uh
 i think uh that's inspiring to me and should be inspiring to a lot ofscientists out there
 on so many levels just like we said on the engineering level that maybe there'spropulsion systems
 we can actually build that can do some crazyamazing stuff so it's a at the very
 least intriguing and at the best inspiring i just want tosay that but
 on the video side it's like it's uh the videosfor the fleur video the go fast
 and the gimbal video they are only interesting to me to mein the context of your story like
 without that they're kind of low resolutionit's like it it's easier to build a
 debunking story to be skeptical so it's just wherei'm coming from maybe you can convince
 me otherwise but so to bring up mick west one moretime
 he looks at the flair video and he says thatone of the most amazing video parts of
 the flare video for people who haven't seen itis at the end of it uh the
 the the tic-tac flies or appears to fly very quickly to theleft
 off the screen off the screen and what midwest saysis uh that it you know midwest probably
 others that the way to explain thatis the tracking system like we said this
 vision based tracking simply loses the like the objectthe tracking loses it and so
 it simply allows the object to uh float off screen because it's no longertracking it so
 i find that at least a plausible explanationof that video looking at your face


2:42:04
Speaker 0 :

2:42:07
Speaker 1 :you do not so can you maybe comment to
 that uh to that debunking uh sure

2:42:11
Speaker 0 :so um it's funny how people can
 extrapolate stuff who've never operated the system nofor sure and that's like me going
 because i'm a big formula one fan you know that's like me going oh my godlouis what were you doing you could have
 done this with the car and you need to won the race right you know and lewishamilton right now is
 you know defending world champion two time he's four-time four-five-time worldchampion but
 um that would be pretty stupid to me to try and tell lewis hamilton how to drivea car
 yeah um or a matter of fact anyone driving a formula one car so i ican't tell you how many times i've
 watched you gotta remember when we looked at this thingwhen when chad came back with the video
 we sat there and watched it i mean i can't tell you how many times i'vewatched it off the original tapes going
 all right right all right let's look at thisum you know because you can look and see
 where the you can see where the airplane is going you can see if it's lookingleft or right and if you actually watch
 all that stuff it doesn't do that it actuallywhen the vehicle starts to move the bars
 the tracking gate starts to open up and the people at raytheon could probablyadd to this because they built the pod
 the tracking gate will start to open up and and but the thingwhen it leaves so fast off the screen
 the pod can't move fast enough it has gimbal rates on how fast that thing canmove around because there's another
 theory that oh with the pods looking forward whenthe pod passes underneath the airplane
 so if i'm looking at you and you pass underneath me asdoes this the ball will actually flip
 around to kind of finish off and it'll it'll it swaps ends because ithas you know it's a gimbal
 it can't just it's not free-floating um but there's a theory on one of them ohit's here and it flipped over it doesn't
 do that when it's looking out in front it stays like thisso that yet another another debunker who
 doesn't know this so you know and mick has had severaltheories on other of some of the other
 videos like one of them the go fast as a birdand jeremy corbell actually did a nice
 job of saying no it's not because he's on he's on black hot so the thewhite object is actually colder than the
 ocean that's flying well birds aren't colderthan the ocean they'd be dead


2:44:04
Speaker 1 :so the gimbal video to comment on
 the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation the apparent rotation of theobject that
 is something that is not possible to do with systems that we knowof
 and make west suggests that uh flare like reflectionsor whatever can explain no because what


2:44:31
Speaker 0 :mick west doesn't see is so
 when they take because i've talked to the one of themactually i work with so i know him i
 know i talk to him all the time so uh and it's his best friend actuallyshot the video
 one of his best friends for the giveaway video the game both of themthe go fast and the gimbal were shot by
 the same person okay so uh and they were in each other'swedding so that's how well they know
 each other okay so what you don't see isso the airplanes that are flying still
 super hornets but they have the apg-79 which is the newphased array radar that's made by
 raytheon things incredible okay it doesn't usually if it's if it's outthere and it sees it it's real
 so at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuffand then they actually threw one of the
 targeting pods out there well the targeting pod there's a heatsignature and you go hey dot heat
 signature something's there it's real it's not you're not picking upsome extraneous things so
 what you see in the gimbal video of the thing and it rotates and you go holy look at that thing it's just
 sitting there and it's in the wind and it's going against the windwhy it's doing this you know someone
 goes oh it's an airplane now if an airplane does this it's eventually goingto start to change aspect because it's
 in a turn this thing doesn't change aspect it justrotates right
 the other thing that you see when you talk to them is so they're on theirradar
 there's an object that they identify as their number one priority or theirlaunch and steering
 so when they designate that that's where the targeting pod is going to lookthat's what you get in the gimbal video
 there's five other i think it's five they're kind of in a v you know like ageese would fly
 that are out in front of it and they're actually coming they're out in front ofit and they actually turn
 on the radar and go the other way while they're filming the gimbal videowhich it's i know uh ryan has come out
 and talked about it but when you see it you go you know ifyou take it in context because you go oh
 it's just the video well if you take the video with theradar going no there's actually other
 things out there because there's at least 60 people that haveseen these things on radar
 off the vacates it was it actually becamei called a buddy mike who was running
 the wing at the time the fighter wing i said what are you guys doing aboutthis he goes well we got to know tam out
 which is a notice to airmen which means there's these objects out therein the warning area so anyone can you
 can fly a cessna through the warning area it's all the warning area tells youthat there's
 high military traffic and training out here it's probably best not to be herebut there's nothing that prohibits you
 from going in there so these things have the right whereverthey're from or whatever they are
 you know because people are like oh they're balloons well balloons floatballoons don't sit in in in 70 knots of
 wind and stay in the same location they don't saythey had an airplane because there was
 two there's the gimbal thing that's a pretty big objectthere's also they talk about it looks
 like a cube that's inside of a sphere a

2:47:11
Speaker 1 :translucent sphere what's that
 transparent how is that and so i've heard theyalmost hit one it's almost hit
 hit them so that's another that's one of the biggestanother biggest account it's like almost
 hit a plane uh uh something that appeared to be acube in a translucent sphere what do you


2:47:28
Speaker 0 :make of that
 again you know what i mean that

2:47:33
Speaker 1 :that's that's the most dangerous you're


2:47:35
Speaker 0 :right the biggest frustration is when
 you do that you go okay so this thing passed between twoairplanes and it was i think it was in
 like 100 feet or something like that of the airplane thatalmost hit it so they do is they come
 back and go hey i had a near midair what do you have in your mid-air withthis floating beach ball with this cube
 inside of it and you go huh you know so they send out a no tam againand they they do a what's called a
 hazard report that says hey there's these objects out there we almost hitone
 you know and that gets sent off to the naval safety center um[Music]
 what was done i mean what are you going to do you can you know catch one go outwith a giant net and try and bag one
 you don't know because they've seen them they've picked them up like hovering onradar and then all of a sudden they're
 traveling at really high rates of speed soyou know what i'm gonna do what yeah
 what are you gonna do well and that let

2:48:18
Speaker 1 :me ask this because this is what people
 kind of think about afteryou witnessed tic tac and after this
 these incidents as far as we know uh with the gimbal and the go fastit seems like people in the military did
 not did not react like what like did notfreak out
 it almost like was a like a mundane eventhow do you explain that why didn't the
 people on the ship not the higher-ups why did wasn't there abig freak out or
 as some people suggest the higher-ups knew about itall along and just we're not letting
 everyone know that there's some kind of secret militaryuh uh you know it's like
 like tests yeah so let's talk about so

2:49:06
Speaker 0 :let's say you've got this cool new toy
 which you call it a cool new toy you typically don't take your cool new toyout into an area where the cool new toy
 could get damaged or what if the airplane would have actuallyhit your cool new toy and you got two
 people that are ejecting or dead and you got ayou know 80 million airplane that's now
 in the bottom of the atlantic you know tests are normally done incontrolled environments just it's like
 any test a lab test or whatever when you takethings out into the real world
 you know you're still going to test it in an area where something goes wrong sowhen they started and we'll go back to
 elon so my friend that worked there they had a rocket go off they were outin kwajalein and when the rocket went up
 a fuel line ruptured in the rocket and it ran out of fuel before it got all theway up and it came falling back down
 well when you're out on an atoll in the pacific if it's going up above youthe worst case is going to land on you
 so you're worried about where else is it going to land and it actually crashednext to the atoll and and
 you know elon wasn't happy and threw this guy under the busso um that's a test environment because
 you don't know what's going to happen so because someone said well when we chasedthe tic tac well it could have been some
 secret government thing well secret government things typically just don'tcome out and test


2:50:20
Speaker 1 :to where unknowing pilots you can't
 control a lot of things you're exactly right so

2:50:24
Speaker 0 :you go you know
 it's you know it's not the doctor evil scientist that's going to throw outthere
 to get there's control and there's reasons that we do itbecause a lot of stuff especially when
 you get to there's there's you build something in theory you modelit
 you go hey this is it looks like it's going to work you get funding you buildit
 you test it some more you bench test it you know youlike an airplane with digital flight
 controls before it even leaves the groundthey've got things over the pedostatic
 system that are changing the what the airplane thinks is the airspeedtalking to it and it's probably up on
 jack so the gear up so it doesn't it thinks it's flying itdoesn't know it's sitting on
 jack stands and they're just changing the pressure on the pedostatic system sothey can actually make the flight
 controls move and they can get all the data back to gohey it looks like it's going to work and
 then there's when there's a bunch of stuff that they do

2:51:14
Speaker 1 :that's a control environment which you
 can do the testing yeah throwing

2:51:17
Speaker 0 :out in the middle of
 where people are doing exercises is the most preposterous thing that i'veheard
 is it possible yes is it more really is it is it is it more likelyit's more likely
 they're not doing that yeah and the

2:51:33
Speaker 1 :other the other side of that
 question is why do you think people on the nimitzand in the us government in general not
 freak out more at the incredible thing that you've seenfreak out in a positive way freak out in
 the negative way like what are the russians up to againor or more
 like what is this like so more turmoil

2:51:56
Speaker 0 :so if you to put a chinese flag on the
 side of it or a russian flag on the side of it i said yeah it had a big russianflag on the side of it dude
 then it would have got a lot of attention it would have went high orderyeah right if it was
 you don't have to say russia or china just say if there was another country'semblem on the side of this thing that we
 saw and said oh it belonged to them thenit's a big deal
 so here's what's going on so we're literally in the middle of workups andit was a joint workup normally they we
 go out for a month go come back do stuff go out for a month this was a two monthat sea period
 where we actually had to beg for them to let us when the ship pulled in atthanksgiving so we could run home up to
 the central valley have thanksgiving with our family and then run back downand do this okay
 so you know and i had just taken over i had the squadron for a monthright so i'm a a brand new ceo i'm the
 most junior guy on the as as far as the commandingofficer goes
 for time in the navy and actually at the time i think it was the most junior ceofor o5 command in the navy right so
 you go okay so i'm out here i got my squadron i'm running it i see this thingyou know we catch for it i have a
 squadron to run i have the the the tic tac was over here andalthough an extraordinary event
 i have 17 air crew and 300 sailors that i'm responsible forright their well-being making sure
 they're fed making sure they're happy they're birthing you know and i'mworking with my master chief and i'm
 working with my exo snap and and we're going through allthis stuff
 i don't have a lot of time to worry about the tic tacyeah if people need to talk to me so you
 got to remember you got the captain of the ship you gotthe airwing commander
 and you got the admiral those are the top three and you got the ceo of thethe princeton who is a major command guy
 and that's really your big major command and then everything else is you got allthe squadrons with your o5 command and
 you got the small boys that are out there which is 05 commands soin the hierarchy as far as rank and
 responsibility of what's going on i'm pretty much in the top 20 with allmy peers and then i've got obviously
 the captain uh and the admiral right and then he's got somepost-command guys on his staff that we
 were friends with i thought you were

2:54:03
Speaker 1 :responsible for a lot of things
 yes oh yeah this schedule yeah there's missionsyou have to do a lot get the job done
 and there's no time for silly things that's exactly

2:54:13
Speaker 0 :right so and we're the
 we're the integration you know when when a battle group deploys especially whenyou go to the middle east for what we
 were doing the air power is the key it's we takeour
 airport with us we can park it anywhere we want and we can do what we need to doso we're kind of key players so when you
 get the theory that oh all these men in suits showed up sothe captain of the ship never said
 anything to me the admiral never saying to and the people on his staff that iwas friends with never saying to me the
 other ceos that i talk to on a daily basis never said anything to me and noone ever came and talked to me and i'm
 the guy that chased it so in all the theories and all thedebunkers and all the stories because i
 don't know if people think they're gonna get rich on this because i made a bigdonut on this
 i can tell you what i got paid for i got paid to go out and spend 21 hours of myday going to la and do a five-minute
 talk for someone and i'm like and it wasn't for the talk because i'lltalk for free because you're not paying
 me i said i said and then i got paid to goto the mcminnville fest because they
 my wife and i got to go because it was just look like fun because the wholetown gets involved yeah
 and it's the only time i've ever spoken publicly in front of a large audienceabout this because it was just
 you know it was fun and i got asked and jeremy and george napping went the yearbefore so i went with with bob lazar
 so i got to hang out with bob and his wife and his wife and my wife andyou know we all hung out kind of you
 know talking not about ufo stuff but just getting to know each other aspeople
 because you know bob's like me the stuff that he talks about is not the center ofhis life if anything it ruined his life
 you know he's just a really really smart guythat's just like the rest of us trying
 to get through life yeah that's

2:55:43
Speaker 1 :nevertheless i mean that was one of the
 sad things reading um uh louis lozando's resignationnote from his uh uh he was the program
 director at the uh atip program like alright yeahone of the sad things is that he's
 mentioned that you know people in government just don't take thisseriously as a threat
 like ufos as a threat like you said if it doesn't have a russian label on itit's a it's a sad thing to think about
 that that we have such a busy schedule thatthe
 anomaly it doesn't is a distraction that we don't want todeal with and it kind of just
 fades into history like literally it's kind of sad to think that if aliens

2:56:34
Speaker 0 :showed up


2:56:34
Speaker 1 :like and uh it just didn't it because
 they're not like when aliens show up they're notgoing to
 be a thing that's on the schedule and if theydon't start killing people they just
 kind of show up in some very uh nonchalant peaceful waybriefly people would be like
 that's that that's uh i don't have time for this

2:57:02
Speaker 0 :that's so sad it's like anywhere in the
 world so you know go back let's go back way backway back in the time machine you know
 there were people kind of scattered around the globeyou know in europe's a perfect example
 why does france speak french and then right next to them spanish youknow spain speaks spanish
 and then you kind of jump over and germans or german andthe polish people everyone speaks a
 different language because if you look at the way the terrain kind of subdividethe original
 people that were there you know thousands of years agothey speak differently right you'd be
 like the us but see the us is different we all speak english because whathappened we came over and we started on
 the east coast and we migrated west we won't get intothe you know what happened and
 you know because the native americans all spoke different languages yeahyou know it's that same type of thing so
 but anytime we have a tendency to show upyou're you're actually you think about
 you're an alien if i go to a different area if i justyou know go back 500 years where you
 know or a thousand years where travel we weren't traveling across oceans at thetime we were well we don't think we were
 the vikings probably were um because we had limited you know wehad to have supplies and the boats
 weren't as big we had to build them by hand we didn't have power tools and allthat stuff so you know
 if you show up someplace like when the conquistadors from spain came over intosouth america and you've got
 you know the natives you're actually an alienyou know and then you look at what
 typically happens when aliens show up in in a human alien world you know andwhen i say alien i mean you are not from
 that area the other wewe take what we want and that's what
 happened i mean we literally defuncted civilizations because that'show we are
 you know humans are we're an interesting groupso you go now what what if something is
 from someplace else just let's just let's just go off the grid and go ahlet's say there are little green men
 yeah what are their intentions lou asked me this when we weretalking to lou alezando and he said what
 do you think they were here for us i don't knowhe goes what i go hello they were
 observing they'd come down they'd hang out he goeswhat if they were prepping the
 battlefield what if they were observing to figure out what we doand you go that's interesting the other
 theory is maybe there's a more advanced civilization out here and they justcheck in on us
 because the threat to an advanced civilization is when a civilizationthat's inferior to them
 actually develops enough and fast enough to become equal or abovebecause now these they become the
 threatened type so you watch us grow until we start getting too muchyou know it's kind of like you go well
 because they always have a tendency to hang out around nuclearright and you go well you know they're
 if this is an advanced civilization i'm gonna go science fiction kind of comicalthey come down and watch us and go look
 at the the the crazy upright monkeys now havedeveloped the atom bomb let's hope they
 don't destroy themselves yeah if i was

2:59:48
Speaker 1 :an alien civilization i would start
 paying attention with the atom bomb that's why thei mean there's certainly an uptick of uh
 what is it ufo sightings since since the nuclear since the nuclear erayeah
 that's you go um

3:00:05
Speaker 0 :

3:00:07
Speaker 1 :let me ask a little bit out there
 question maybe it's a speculation but maybe touching on roswelldo you think it's possible that there is
 out of this world aircraft or beings that are in the possession ofone of the governments on this earth
 like the us government is it possible so the one perspective ofthat
 if it's possible is it possible to keep a secret like that

3:00:40
Speaker 0 :i would say this i think it's very it's
 highly possible because if you go if you just look atall the sightings and let's go
 just look at project blue book oh it was what forget how many thousands ofsightings and there's a percentage it's
 like 10 or 15 percent they still can't explain like our tictac is one of them you know they
 basically the government has come out and said we don't know what that wasokay so so if you go okay of that
 fifteen percent that we don't know and of these thousands they're stillthat 15 makes up a pretty big number
 what are the chances that not one of them crashed somewhere on the globeand was recovered and i don't care if
 it's a intact system or you got pieces of it of a metal thatwe can't explain
 or some some um biological matter to say the least it could beintact or it couldn't but
 the the odds of that now are starting to go down thatyou know that could never happen and i'm
 not talking just the united states i'm talkingthe world globally so is there a chance
 that a foreign government actually possesses or our governmentor someone in the in the world on the
 globe of the seven plus billion people has something that is not from thisworld and i'm not talking to meteor but
 something that was manufactured in some way that allowedtransport
 or observation it could be a drone could be a foreign drone you know like voyagerflies around and does all that stuff and
 we got stuff that just went past pluto that's out in the kuiper beltyou know there's there's stuff out there
 floating around and what about ours it's going to crash into jupiter eventuallyor whatever
 because we've had stuff crashing the planets so if that's the caseyou would think something is out there
 that we have something that we can't explain and according tolou there's stuff that we can't explain
 you know and i would assume that lou who ran atip has has seen stuff that hecan't openly talk about
 because you know because i had a clearance when you have a clearanceyou were you sign your name you're bound
 to that and to me that's an important oaththat you hold to you know this is kind
 of where uh you know people have issues with bob soif
 you know and i leave it to you to determine if you believe bob or not i'lltell you bob is a straightforward
 very sane normal super smart guy bob sorry yeah yes there is the other sidethat says well
 should he have come out and talked you know to those who owe clearance whoyou know are true to the government you
 would say he should have never spoke he he was under an oath to not say anythingbut he did
 if you asked bob why did you say something his thehis answer was i understand there's an
 oath but i felt that the technology could benefitall of mankind and it shouldn't be
 locked away and i'll leave if you believe bob that'sthat's kind of what bob says


3:03:17
Speaker 1 :and that that's such a interesting key
 point if there is aircraft a technology that'sin the possession of the
 say the us government should they make that publicly knownthis is the snowden question this is the
 question of like do we release stuff that can potentiallychange
 the nature of human civilization like thethe way we the way we think about our
 place in the world also the if that technology ispotentially
 useful for military applications the nature of military conflict shouldwe release that information or not
 if you were the government so here well

3:03:58
Speaker 0 :here's exactly how so
 for for classified information the government is the people that classifyit
 so i can't go i can't look at something and go oh my godthis avion bottle is now top secret i
 can't i don't have the authority the ability or anyone to do that that's theguard that's up to the government i
 agree with that because i worked for the government for 24 yearsof my life so
 um i understand that but now you go there's reason stuff is classified okayand it has to do with
 uh sometimes information is classified by how it was obtainedit's just like the mob if i have a spy
 and i'm a mobster and you're the counter mobster but i have a guy on the insidethat's feeding me information
 i can't do it and a perfect example is if you've ever seen the uhit's the tom cruise movie what is it air
 america or whatever but he he plays the guy in louisiana who washauling drugs for pablo escobar
 and he ended up getting a cargo plane and the government the cia was kind offunding him to do stuff
 that's how he got hooked up with pablo but they put cameras on his airplane andwhen reagan had come out and said here's
 pictures we have proof that they're running these drugsit didn't take pablo long to figure out
 those pictures were taken from inside of the plane of this guy he had beenworking with and that guy ends up dead
 does that make sense so you classify to protect the sourceyou classify to protect the technology
 because if the technology would get out it could begrave damage or there's levels depending
 on if it's a secret or top secret there are levels of damage that can bedone to the u.s government and our
 well-being as a country and we owe it to this because we're allamericans you know to me
 no matter what some people will say even in this country this is the greatestcountry on the planet
 this is the only country that you have the ability to do what you want to doit's just don't be lazy
 and i have stories of people that came over here and started with nothingand they're they're living the american
 dream and they'll tell you and they didn't get it because of youknow like you
 you came over here from russia you get nominority status or anything else you get
 you're a white anglo-saxon protestant whateveryou're religious you're over you but you
 come over here i kind of knew that from the last time butum but you come over here you basically
 have made yourself you're educated you're working atliterally the top research
 university in the world to be honest

3:06:17
Speaker 1 :um i can do whatever the hell i can
 create and with a bit of with a lot of hard work ican do quite a


3:06:24
Speaker 0 :and no one gave it to you yeah so i mean


3:06:27
Speaker 1 :i'm a believer that like i mean
 we are uh a community so like there is a social aspect to it but thefreedom
 and the american dream is a real thing and that this is this iyou know i joke about being russian but
 i i'm an american and this is i do believe the greatest country onearth so there's a reason
 the nationalist pride uh the pride in your nation is a powerful thing andaround that this secrecy
 holds value but to me alien technology is bigger than that i mean it'sit's not so much a threat as a
 you're holding back something that could inspire the worldlike human knowledge so let's talk in


3:07:14
Speaker 0 :theory so
 i'm gonna go back to bob because i've talked aboutso bob is a propulsion guy
 right right bob has a bicycle with a rocket motor he built the rocket caryou know so he did that so if you are
 trying to figure out a propulsion system let's just say this is i'm just talkingthis is dave's theory
 i am i own i have i have custody of this thing from a technology that i don'tunderstand
 and i know it's a propulsion system so now i gotta figure it outright so who are you gonna go to right
 you go find someone so you go wait here's a guy who at the time was workingat los alamos which they have proven
 who is big into propulsion he designs all this he builds a in his garagehey he's super smart why don't we bring
 him in so you hire him on a contract and you gohey we're going to brief you into a
 program and he goes and works on wherever he says he worked you knowthat's not important but you get access
 to the technology to try and figure it outand then you go well you know bob comes
 out and says you know like we're figuring out these things butthere's a part where our technology
 isn't advanced enough for us to figure the whole thing outso then you know and let's just say bob
 doesn't come out and tell anyone he he works on it until he gets to thepoint where he's stagnated
 he he said he's in a wall you go i can't do it so sometimes the best thing is tobring in a fresh mind so you go find
 someone else who's in a propulsion you bring them and they workthey can't figure it out or they get to
 the point where kind of back to the einstein theory where hey i've got allthese theories on how it works but we
 don't have the technology we haven't advanced enough toactually do what we need to do we still
 have to advance technology more so then what do you do you shelve it yougo hey good
 project's over and the contract you shelf it and you wait another 10 yearsand you wait another 10 years until
 technology and our abilities and our our research advances more and then yougo find new people to bring in that are
 experts in that field and go hey we want you to work on this thingand here's what we know about it so far
 or you don't tell them anything because because remember if youif you reveal someone else's research
 you can taint their beliefs they'll start to sway in that direction so yougo
 i'm not going to tell you anything i'm going to give you this thing and now youtell me what you think and as they
 progress if they get stuck on a problem that maybe bob and someoneelse solved earlier you can go hey what
 about this you don't have to tell where it came fromwhat about this and now they can
 leapfrog and they get another two steps closer to the final answerand then we get stuck by our evolution
 of technology do you shelve it again

3:09:39
Speaker 1 :do you think that's the right way to do
 it because it's heartbreaking i don't listen i love government butwe just had this discussion about elon
 and so on the the alternative approach is torelease this to the world and say
 there's a mystery here and then the elons of the world the jeffbezos who talked about money but it's
 also not just money it's like this engine that's within we talkedabout the american dream to say
 i'm gonna be the one that cracks this mystery openand like that's within a lot of us and
 like money aside people in their garage just will but

3:10:17
Speaker 0 :you're thinking like a scientist
 now let me now let's shift to let me think like a country so we have countrya b and c
 and you can look at the nuclear arms race so we know that germany was reallyclose
 we know that russia was getting pretty close we just wonthe race and we were the first ones with
 it yeah and still to the state germany could have wonthey could have won they could have won
 but someone was smart enough to not finish the equation when they knew theyhad the answer
 it's literally what it comes down to someone was smart enough to realize thatthat
 that got into the hands of the nazis that it would be the endand and that's that's a tough call to do
 that knowing that you have the answer and youcan't solve the problem because it will
 go into the wrong hand and that's kind of the fear when you look at this you gookay so if we do this if we put it out
 there we've got this technology if we don't work on it kind ofinternational space station like we're
 all going to work on it together in uh you know like antarctica is reallysupposed to be
 treaty free from any weapons or anything we're supposed to we got theinternational thing down there we're all
 going to work together if you did it in the confines of thatand you could control the flow in and
 out because what you don't want is thesomeone stealing information and getting
 it back to where and countries are notorious todo this hey we're doing internationally
 but we're secretly doing it ourselves to see who can come up with a solutionfirst
 that's the problem because we have this inherent thing of power and technologylike that is power
 it would literally change the game of the way the world operates and fromnot just a transportation or mankind but
 from a military aspect it's got huge huge uh

3:11:53
Speaker 1 :yeah yeah i guess so beautifully
 beautifully presented and there's i feel like there's atension between those two places the
 scientists view the world and the national security view of theworld
 let me let me get to this kind of interesting point which isa lot of conspiracy theorists kind of
 paint a picture of government as an exceptionallyas a hierarchical system that's
 exceptionally competent and good at hiding secrets and theni mean i tend to not subscribe to almost
 any conspiracy theory to the degree at least that theconspiracy theorists do uh i agree with
 you but the there does seem to be and i tendto think of government as
 unfortunately uh uh incompetent at least the bureaucracyit seems that the communication like the
 three videos that were released and just the way of dod in generaltalks about the things we've been
 talking about it's just confused it's contradictoryit's not inspiring
 it's it's uh suspicious it's just not even the way they release the videos youknow the tic tac
 if presented correctly could just inspire generation of scientistsit's like at the you know us going to
 the moon and it's inspiring i mean it'sincredible like you know and and the way
 it was released was suspicious it was likelow resolution video on a crappy website
 like with some crappy documents and uh i mean why what i don't know how to askthis question but
 can government do better why are they doing it this way in terms ofcommunicating the things they do know to
 the public because i don't think they

3:13:39
Speaker 0 :know how
 especially in this topic it's been hidden for so many yearsand i don't think uh because i don't buy
 off on the conspiracy stuff i just think that you know when it comesin like i said you know the government
 has a right to classify stuff they they classify everything becausethey don't know you have something you
 don't know what it is you don't know so we just go well it must bemust be top secret and let's put it in a
 vault you know it's kind of like the indiana jones where they take theark and they put it in the it's in the
 giant army warehouse um you know we don't even know what wehave
 so but i also believe that you know and i'll say this openly i don't think thatthe american people
 need to know everything i think there's a reason that stuff is classified forthe protection of this country
 and i totally believe in that so you knowand i was joking with joe when he was
 talking about storm area 51 stuff i'm like yeah that's probably the worstidea you could possibly have is to just
 storm a military installation it's just stupid there are reasons thereare reasons that we have things that we
 don't just let out to the public because if we do as soon as you do let someoneknow that you have something
 they immediately try and encounter it a perfect examplethe u.s and the 60s developed a bomber
 it was a mach 3 compression lift bomber called the xb70okay there was three of them built three
 of them ever built it was a like 60 000 foot high you knowmach
 3 it was an incredible airplane when you see it there's actually the last oneremaining is in dayton ohio at the
 museum you know it would go that wingtips wouldfall down it looks like a concord but
 it's way faster when that got out that we weredeveloping it the soviet union developed
 the mig-25 literally a high-altitude interceptor tocounter that bomber
 and they built an entire fleet of mig-25sright we built three xb70s and we
 scrapped the program right because now you go well it's thetechnology is cool we proved it but now
 it becomes obsolete so it's not even worth building a whole fleet of thesethings
 you know it's constant it's a chess game we do something they do something we dosomething they do something and it's
 we do something and then they counter it they got a fee it's you got to figureout how to defeat it
 so you go oh we'll build something so the more we keepuh quiet especially from a defense
 standpoint the better we actually at person i thinkwe talk too much and i think the the
 military and the dod is starting to see thatyou know we're too open you know you
 know you announce hey we're building this because there's a budget line andwe live in a free society
 um but you don't have to release all the specsand you don't have to put everything in
 open source but that's a problem when we go tothe universities if we want to go do
 work with mit and you want to partner with mit and you're a defense companyand you want to partner
 you know you guys have a rule that if you create it then it can be open sourcebecause the university owns it and we
 are an institution of learning yeah wherethe defense side might go
 we don't we don't really want that published in a paper in scientificamerica or


3:16:39
Speaker 1 :i call it a break i talked to the cto of
 lockheed kaoko jackson and just just conquers thesome of the best if not the best
 engineering and science but engineering reallyever is done in secrecy
 and it sucks because it's so inspiring and they can't talk about it

3:17:01
Speaker 0 :it is due to funding the us government
 has deep pockets you know some of this new technologythat you develop for an open source
 unless this goes back to the originalconversation we now there's enough money
 in the private sector that individuals controlyeah bezos i'm not talking amazon
 i'm talking jeff bezos a single individual worth over a hundred billiondollars
 he has the ability to do stuff i'll tell you what the gates foundation withbetween bill gates and
 and and his his wife and warren buffett and some of the other money because ithink uh
 bezos's ex-wife actually donated a huge chunk of her halfinto the gates foundation so i mean
 what's the gates foundation worth these daysyou know if and these are guys you know
 brilliant brilliant i mean some of the greatestminds that we have to go you know what
 are they doing because they have the abilityit's a non-profit they can go hey i want
 to fund this i want to fund this research

3:17:53
Speaker 1 :they can look beyond the conflict
 between nations you can look beyond the

3:17:56
Speaker 0 :conflict of having to have
 you know classification you can do what you want you knowit's just like you know we we classify
 how to do uh you know the whole nuclear you knowhow to create
 critical mass right but there's really smart high school kids that have figuredout mathematically and they do their
 science project and then the government comes in and says hey we got to classifyyour government because we just don't
 want this out in the public domain which i understand but they never stopthem from free thought and developing
 that it's just we really don't want this out there okayso i understand that i totally
 understand that but if they you know if if bill and melindawant to do this and go hey we want to do
 this and they're going to work with bezos and they're going to work withelon and we're going to
 be think about it there's a significant amount of money that could be availableto r d and i'm not talking just science
 like this i'm talking medical research and all this but thenyou go who gets it because now you're
 competing against the companies that actually do it you gois that well are they the
 greatest minds i'd say you know that we have a tendency to go these are thebest that we have and i'd say well no
 that's the best that we know we have but there's probably people out therethat don't want to work there's
 brilliant minds that don't want to do anything with defensebecause they just disagree with what it
 does so they go to another path they can do something else and that in a

3:19:10
Speaker 1 :sense like
 the elon's of the world that jeff bezos actuallyin a certain sense much better than uh
 dod at finding the brilliant weird minds out

3:19:22
Speaker 0 :there
 because they're not tied to the government so when you work a governmentcontract
 the government writes they tell you what they want and then they work with you onthe requirements and they usually have a
 an end in mean you know they have an ideathat this is what i want it to be
 where if you go to like spacex where you know they come up with whydon't we just
 land these things on a pad and reuse them yeah well if the governmentscientists if you're on a government
 contract says no that's not the requirements we're not paying for thatwe want you to do this you're kind of
 controlled or when elon does it his company theycan do whatever the hell they want to do
 because they have no bounds the only bounds they have is theliability if it doesn't work and it
 lands on something so what do you do you go out to kwajalein and you test it andif it crashes and it lands in the ocean
 hey we clean it up no big deal we lost some moneybut we'll move on it's you know money
 makes the world go round contrary to what everyone thinks but youknow there's a lot of money that's
 sitting around that you can do a lot of really cool stuff with and i don't knowi mean i'll guarantee that uh what is it
 blue origin isn't that amazon yeah you know thatthey're doing some cool stuff because
 they have funny and i joke with the guy i knowthat worked at spacex and
 he was funny because they were building the first test thingand they they were limited and elon
 found this like 400 acre thing i think it's about 400 acres down by waco texasand he's like i go how he goes he goes
 dude i worked he goes i worked with he goes because he's done governmentcontract he goes there's government
 contract and then there's working at spacex with elon money andthat's what he refers to it as his elon
 money where it was like don't i'll throw them and he would throwthe money at it and make it happen and
 it's i'm talking this fast yeah i mean hetalks about he has a great story about
 this i mean this is elon this is how fast you can do in theprivate sector vice the government where
 there's the bureaucracy is they had a company that was a basicallya tool-and-die machine shop that did a
 lot of their high-precision parts for the rockets they had went tothe guy but he had contracts with other
 companies and when the economy was down the guy was actually looking at goingout of business so the guy i know
 he's telling me the story he he was talking to the guy he had to go overthere and get something and he's like
 holy he goes hang on so he calls up on the phonespacex he says hey is elon there can you
 get him in the board room we'll be there in 20 minutesso he grabs this guy who's literally
 going to fold his company they go over to spacex and i may begetting some of this wrong if people are
 going to fact check me but this is pretty closethey go in the boardroom and and he said
 literally within like you know an hour or twoelon has bought the guy's company that
 guy is now a senior vp running the his company and they'regonna pull all the stuff
 into the spacex thing so they can actually build the parts and they canstill contract out to make the money
 outside and it happened like that fast it's not

3:22:07
Speaker 1 :just money
 it's because i've seen i witnessed it too with elon i think it's uhwhatever the whatever the forces of
 capitalism that that uh allow a person like elon musk to rise tothe top
 but like because i've also worked for darpa like for research forin terms of a source of funding i i
 there's a weight of bureaucracy when i was working like being funded bydarpa
 and with elon like i was literally in the presence of likeanything is possible cutting across all
 the of paperwork of the way things were donein the past
 of the bureaucracy the rules the constraints theall of that stuff just you can cut
 across immediately how much money and

3:22:48
Speaker 0 :time do you waste dealing with your
 bureaucracy when you could actually be doing real workthat's the difference this is why i
 honestly when i went back to the industrial defense complex that we werewarned about
 when you look at it and go spacex can do something for half the price ahead ofschedule
 that would boeing were paying boeing and you go ohwell this just came out you go well then
 why are we even dealing with this side when we can deal with this side yeahbecause you've got a fully automated
 capsule that has a manual mode that they got to fly around init worked like a champ it went up it
 hung out it came back it splashed down it worked perfectly you know we're gonnadust it off
 and oh by the way unlike the apollo capsules that were used and thenput to museums they're going to reuse
 that dragon capsule it came down they're going to dust it off put a new coat ofpaint on it slap it on top of another
 rocket and away it goes holy cow it's amazing it's a shift it'sa complete shift and mentality and for
 us as taxpayers we can explore at half the cost

3:23:46
Speaker 1 :yeah it's exciting especially given
 putting the tic tac in context like then the sky orbut it's limitless the possibilities we
 could do with this kind of mechanism i

3:23:58
Speaker 0 :think it's exciting yeah i think we live
 in an exciting time right now besides everything that'smessed up in the world right now well


3:24:02
Speaker 1 :this is a this is a hopeful like there's
 so much conflict going on so much tensionuh that's to me space exploration at the
 moment is a reason to uh get up in the morningand
 have a hope for the future to look up to the sky andwe're humans we can like solve so many
 we can solve all of this i was talking

3:24:21
Speaker 0 :about when i was doing the tucker thing
 and i said uh this would be great you know becausewhen the government had come out you
 know a month ago and said hey this does exist we're doing this andwe're going to release more stuff
 and i was texting like lou and chris mellon and those guysbefore i went on because they had called
 me up to be on tucker's show and i'm like hey i goyou know this would be great you know
 just come out with this find the the relic of a spaceship likepull out the roswell wreckage if you
 have it pull out the roswell wreckage and do itgod it would be so nice to not have to
 deal with the the riots in the cities and i mean iknow it's an election year and all that
 but god it would be something it would berefreshing to not have to turn on my tv
 and see everything that is just depressing in the world to begin holycow we actually do have this and we're
 working on this technology

3:25:08
Speaker 1 :imagine if there is a roswell aircraft
 and they pull it out imagine the innovation that happens inthe next 10 to 20 years
 without any more information than that justthe innovation that happens the look on
 elon musk's face look on jeff bezos's faceand all the brilliant engineers we


3:25:25
Speaker 0 :changed the game it would change it
 would change the game completely let me

3:25:28
Speaker 1 :ask the big question i
 apologize for the absurd romantic nature of it uhoutside i mean one of the things the
 fact that you've laid your eyes on a ufoprobably opened your eyes to the
 possibility that some of the other sightingsthere there could be other sightings
 that have legitimacy to them what to use the outside of your ownsighting
 is the most interesting citing or ufo related event in history

3:26:01
Speaker 0 :i think there's several what is it
 ramishine forest in england uh the u.s guys that sawstuff and actually got
 radiation burns one guy was medically disabled butthey weren't going to give it and he had
 help from jim carr john mccain his office helped get the guys uhdisability reestablished
 i think that's a big one uh i think there's people out there that have seenstuff
 and i'm talking credible uh because there's you gotta rememberthere's a huge chunk of these sightings
 that get disproven they're they're actually explainableyeah uh you know you had sent me the
 question the the phoenix lights i think there's

3:26:39
Speaker 1 :what's that so i'm sorry i'm not
 familiar with some of these the the

3:26:42
Speaker 0 :uh i'm not either it's i want a funny
 story on that so i was at a i was at a conference andhopefully he doesn't watch us to get
 offended but we had this uh this it was i call it speed dating sothere's a table there's about eight
 people at a table and we would go sit at the table andthey could ask us questions and then
 after 10 minutes we moved to the next tableso i was speed dating all these people
 that are really into this yeah it was kind of funny but i'd sat downand it's always funny because some
 people will try and dominate it but you know you have to kind of push thedominators away so that you know if
 you're quiet and introverted you can ask yourquestion too so we got into this and the
 guy starts naming all these well what about this what about the phoenix lightsi'm like i don't know about the phoenix
 lights what about this event i don't know about that he goeshe looks at me and he goes well you're
 not a ufo guy i go no i'm not but i chase one so i'm anexpert have you
 and you could see him get deflated because i'm kind of a smart ass likethat


3:27:34
Speaker 1 :yeah i mean the first hand experience
 from a credible in some sense these sightings have to doboth with the evidence


3:27:41
Speaker 0 :and the human well i think part of that
 is to us that's a credibility piece because thefour of us that actually saw it plus
 you know the other two that were in the airplane that shot the videonone of us are ufo obsessed people so
 when we come out and say because to me it's just it's five minutes of my lifei mean i did a lot of really cool i've
 had really kind of neat things i've been able to doum
 but when you look at it and go uh we don't it to me it wasn't it's not thepinnacle of my life
 you know to other people that they live in the ufo world andit's like they you know if you talk to
 people they'll go that are really into it who've never seen oneit kills them that they didn't see one
 when here we are because and what's unique with ours which kind of adds thatlevel is it wasn't we just didn't see it
 it wasn't like oh look something in the sky and it was weird we actually engagedwith it
 you know it was yeah that was an engaged five-minute thing and there's otherstories from other countries like
 there's a story of in the back in when the soviet union existedthat they actually
 would chase these things and one of them shot at some you know it shot itbecause they said shoot at it and it
 shot it and then it got shot down and then they said don't ever shoot atthem again and don't chase them just you
 can observe them but don't go after them because obviously they have firepowerthat we can't control because if you can
 make something float around and jam radars at will and do whatever you wantyou know modern terrestrial weapons are
 probably not very useful you know you can go toindependence day they add that force
 field around oh we gotta we gotta now you gotta cyber warfare you gotta takethe bug down you gotta take the warfare
 so now we can actually inhibit some type of damage so there's a

3:29:19
Speaker 1 :i mean you mentioned the phoenix slices
 somebody on i think read it said uh ask him any thoughts on mass ufosightings like the phoenix lights so
 the interesting thing like you said with the tic tac is that multiple peoplelaid their eyes on this what what are
 your thoughts about the phoenix lights ormany people have seen here's the deal


3:29:37
Speaker 0 :with massive sightings
 so the phoenix lights is unexplainable although i know the air force had saidsomething about it was an a10 drop in
 flares no i don't think so yeah oh flares don'tburn that long they just come out and
 they you know they detract when they go awayalthough on the other hand there's you
 know because clouds can do things so so i lived in central california for 18years
 and you would get oh my god what was that in the sky and it was reallyvandenberg shooting a missile off you
 know they were doing icbm tests at one time where they shoot from vandenbergand they fly across and they go land in
 the atoll at kwajalein you know and then they can check thedisplacement the accuracy and all that
 stuff you know it's stuff that we do because we're apower but when you see them go up you
 know especially if you've ever watched a rocket really launch on a clear nightit'll have the stream the glow and you
 can tell it's a rocket but if you don't look up until later when itstarts to get to the outer edge of the
 atmosphere where the plume coming out of the engine isnot constrained but
 you can watch this on tv when leaving the spacex ones go it's nice and narrownarrow narrow and then it hits a point
 where it really starts to go up and it starts to come to the sides becausethere's
 the forces aren't holding that all into one unique thingand it looks really odd and then it'll
 go off because it burns out and then you getstage separation then you see the next
 one go off and then it's gone um and people don't understand thatbecause they didn't watch it from launch
 because we used to sit in our driveway and you know vandenberg is it was athree hour drive but you could sit and
 watch it go you knew they're launching at night you'd watchyou watch thing it's really cool if you
 don't see anything what you see is the weird clouds from the exhaust plumeyou know what's left the residue that's
 sitting in the atmosphere and the wind starts blowing it so you getthese really kind of weird shapes in the
 sky you know that's part but when you go tophoenix lights and you go hey you know
 when when a thousand people see somethingyou're gonna discredit all a thousand
 people are you gonna try and explain it away with something elseyou know you know the big it's a weather
 balloon you know it's a weather balloon again

3:31:27
Speaker 1 :just like the tic tac i think is
 just inspiring uh for the limitless nature of the science i

3:31:35
Speaker 0 :think you're
 i think more is going to come out i think some of the stuff that the the tothe stars folks have done


3:31:43
Speaker 1 :uh so there's a stars academy yeah what
 are your thoughts about them are they um i talk to them quite a bit

3:31:47
Speaker 0 :um i am not a part of to the stars
 academy i you know but you know like i talked tolou i just was texting him
 before this yeah so he they're what's

3:31:56
Speaker 1 :their mission what's their hope what's


3:31:59
Speaker 0 :their what's there when they started
 their mission was to try and don't look at this as little green menbut let's look at this as a technology
 and let's try and almost reverse engineer and figure out how these thingsoperate and
 how can we explain this from using our knowledge you know physics basedknowledge to go how would something like
 this operate that's really their bottom line was totry and use and then
 couple that with because they've got the series unidentifiedum couple that with television
 to get the word out so you're actually putting something instead ofbecause everyone has a theory you know
 ancient aliens covers all kinds of theoriesyou know it's kind of off of oh my god
 and i've seen the stuff and i've seen stuff that i've said taken out ofcontext on shows that i did not talk to
 uh so there's all that because you can take a clip and go oh it's thisit's that you know and if i know about
 stuff like you can't technically use my likeness unless i tell you you canso if i haven't signed something you
 can't do there was a guy who put something out and i was in it i told himyou can take it down and you talk to
 lawyers because i'm not i'm not supporting you so they use it to

3:33:04
Speaker 1 :tell some kind of narrative that this is
 not connected to let's face it if you're

3:33:07
Speaker 0 :making tv shows there's two reasons to
 do it one you want to get word out or two you want to make money or threeboth and so usually it's
 i would say the the make money is probably the biggest thing to put a tvshow out


3:33:20
Speaker 1 :and the the mission of the to the stars
 academy is to not do that this is is to try to get some

3:33:27
Speaker 0 :when i when they started and i talked to
 them because i've talked to tom and i've talked tolou and those are the two main players
 it was to basically demystify the fact and get ridof the
 the stigma that's tied to ufos and let's look at it from a science base and thenuse tv to get the word out on the
 progress and they've done some pretty cool thingsi mean you know they've the the italian
 government gave them all kinds of files thathad been you know property their
 government they got a bunch from it might have been argentina gave themall kinds of stuff like here's all our
 records what can you do with it to try and now pullfrom country based to a more global
 based research which is what you were talking aboutand then using independent scientists
 that are not tied to a government i mean any government but just usingindependent research agencies to start
 looking at some of the metallurgy because you go oh i found this we hadthis piece of metal what is it and some
 of the stuff has been explained they've got someobjects artifacts that have not been
 explained and that's slowly coming out you know and i think uh and your hope is

3:34:25
Speaker 1 :the us government will release


3:34:27
Speaker 0 :well the government is the government
 the us government came out a month ago and said you know we havewe have uh we have material that we
 cannot explain the origin they have said that they just haven'treleased the wreckage from the roswell
 thing which i keep joking about i'm like come on it's 70 some years old

3:34:41
Speaker 1 :i mean let it out i i think he put it
 beautifully that in this time that would be a heck of aninspiring hopeful thing to see
 like people don't just to distract them yeah the division isi mean nothing will unite us humans
 descendants of chimps uh like uh the idea that there's life outthere oh


3:35:04
Speaker 0 :it would literally change i said this a
 while ago i forget i think as the london sun times had called me and i said youknow personally i think this is a global
 issue it's not if there is stuff coming down whichwe're pretty sure there is there's
 enough stuff that we can't explain if there is stuff coming down then thisis not a country based thing and it's
 not about technology and it's not about who's going to win the next warbecause you don't know what they're
 doing so you got really a couple of theories one you've got e.tor close encounters and the other
 extreme is you've got independence day are you going to prepare and bet on etand close encounters
 or do you actually try and do stuff in case it is independence that youactually have a game plan
 and when you get into independence day that scenarioyou know and i don't like going too much
 into sci-fi but let's just say in theory that thatbecomes a reality it's not a us
 russia china england france spain name any country and any continent itbecomes a global issue
 and the only way you can deny it's just like americans we allyou know we're divided it it's been that
 way forever so if you think we won't get through this we'll get through itbecause we've had times just like this
 before

3:36:15
Speaker 1 :until nazi germany pops up but in nazi


3:36:17
Speaker 0 :germany pops up or someone flies two
 airplanes into the world trade center and then all of a sudden we're all likeunited we also have
 very very short memories yes we do exactly it's when you look and go uhwell
 we can do this and you go no no if if you thinkthat everyone on the planet is good
 you need to stop taking the drugs that you're taking you know we said thisthere were people during
 the rise of hitler no no it's it's okay no no it's okay we're not gonna do we'renot gonna stop no no it's okay no no
 it's okay and you gotta think the only thing thatstopped hitler
 was his ego by going into russia if he just stuck with the pact withstalin and not went to the east
 and had to fight and it was really the russian winner that crushed himand he would have put all his high
 troops to the other side there would have been a totallydifferent outcome the man in the iron
 the man in the high tower whatever it's a netflix show wherenazi actually wins it and you look you
 know we didn't know everything that was going on especiallythe atrocities with the concentration
 camps and what he was doing to to the jews i mean it's you look at thatgoing
 if you really want to see evil and then there's the whole side of what stalindid because he actually exterminated
 more people than hitler did but that never gets the press and the

3:37:35
Speaker 1 :thing is
 we forget this we forget this history in our conflicts today we forget thatthere is the nature of evil
 we forget that there's real evil in the world and umthe thing to fight that evil is to be
 united to be uh both it's like this interesting linelike you talked about joe rogan of being
 both like kind to each other compassionateempathetic but also being like
 strong and a bad when you need toto make sure that you that like there's
 a balance between kindness and force that is you you

3:38:15
Speaker 0 :use force when force is necessary but
 you don't have to walk around like billy badass all the time i mean some of thetoughest people that i grew up with
 that literally could kick the out of whoever came near himthey never got in fights because one
 even people that didn't know them because they were actuallynice guys you know they were they're
 just good dudes but you know if you cross them like ihad a friend of mine uh
 he was he's a nationally ranked wrestler he went to went to naval academy with mehe's a very very good friend of mine
 um and uh he is when you meet him and he wrestled at 190 pounds and he didnot lose a match his senior year until
 he went to nationals he just had a bad day he actually lost to a guy he hadpummeled the out of
 and he would cross it was funny we we joke about it even with him because whenyou meet him he's like the nicest like
 lo go hey hey dude you know hey how youdoing he's super nice
 he would cross that ring on a wrestling mat as soon as he crossed that ringit was like a totally different person
 and he would go out there and just destroy peoplei mean physically destroy like put a
 hurt on and he would get done and he's likesuper humble and they'd raise his hand
 and he would he he'd have this blank expression they'd raise his hand andhe'd walk off and as soon as he crossed
 the line he'd he'd look up and smug hey hi guys howyou doing like he literally just went
 could rip someone's arms off but as soon as he crossed line he's a totallydifferent person he's like
 and he's that way today yeah he wouldn't even tell you he's a wrestler yeah

3:39:39
Speaker 1 :that's kind of a symbol of the best of
 america that's what america is oh he's thatwrestler he's across the line
 you're you're uh you could be hard but whenonce you're off the mat you're just a
 kind human being yeah i know you're super humbleuh saying it's better to be lucky than
 good but your story is inspiring thatthe entire trajectory of having a dream
 of accomplishing that dream of having one hell of a career whatadvice
 would you give to a young person to a young version of yourselftoday that listens to this and is
 inspired that wants to fly or wants to go to space who wants tobuild the rocket is there advice
 you could give them about life about career

3:40:33
Speaker 0 :about anything yeah yeah um
 first let me start with uh and you had a question oninspirational people so my grandfather i
 had mentioned him earlier a huge funeral a beer delivery guy um was deliveringbeer and the 60s riots were
 the the guys the black in the black neighborhoods where you know whitepeople didn't go
 and my grandfather's sicilian he was one of the first ones in his family born inthe united states so
 my great grandmother and i had aunts and uncles that i knew growing up thatactually came over on the boat
 um huge huge guy and just the nicest friendliest would give you the shirt offhis back obviously proven by his funeral
 and i'm talking at his funeral the head of the black panthers was athis funeral in in toledo ohio
 the mafia guys were at his funeral in toledo ohio uh i mean it was literally amix of
 of of who's who and he had told me once you know because when you're little youstart looking and i grew up basically
 i was probably middle class lower middle class my dad was a fireman you're notrich he's working for the city it was a
 paycheck to paycheck living is how i grew upand i was talking my grandfather one day
 and he said something to me and this is this is literally how i run mylife he said it was about money because
 you'd see you know back in the day if you saw someone in a mercedes that wasrare
 you know they weren't everywhere and you know people didn't you couldn't lease acar you actually bought a car and
 usually bought a car with cash um so it's a totally different than weare now and he said
 he goes you know david he goes they're no better than you and you're no betterthan anyone else
 he goes you got to remember that he goes everyone's different he goes treateveryone with the respect and dignity
 that they deserve he goes and if they're poor if they'rehomeless he goes it doesn't make him a
 bad person it just that's that's who they chose tobe and you make
 choices in your life but never ever look down on someone becauseyou know there will always be someone
 that will look down on you and you should never ever do thatand i kept that close to me he was a
 huge influence was my mom's dad um just a big big influence in my lifeand the way i carried myself um and he
 was one that would say you know you can be anything you want tobe you know he grew up dirt poor
 you know and the fact that he had bought a house and took good care of mygrandmother and did stuff like that
 you know to him that was a success and to me it was always you know trying tobetter and move on
 and he was the one you know my parents were a big part of this toowas instilling that anything is possible
 so when i'm four years and 11 months old in 1969you know and i'm watching neil armstrong
 walk on the moon and i'm asking my mom and she says well they were all militarypilots and you know we had an
 international guard that at the time was flying f-100 so i'm dating myselfum and i was just fascinated with flight
 and i just looked at that going that's really what i want to do and i neverlost sight of that there was always i
 could do this or do that and when i was going to go to college beforei enlisted in the marine corps i was
 accepted into natural resources at ohio state and i'm like ahif i can't fly i'll go be a forest
 ranger because i wanted to hang out in one of those towers in colorado and lookfor fires because that's just
 i like that stuff you know it was that or be an oceanographer because i wasfascinated with jacques cousteau and i
 actually that's my degree my undergrad degree is jacques cousteauso influences are neil armstrong and
 jack cousteau i have an oceanography degreei got an mba from university of houston
 goku's got to mention them and then uh and so you're looking people go what areyou what are you going to do
 with that and i said you know i got an oceanography degree because i go welli'm going to sail on the ocean so at
 least if the ship sinks i'll know where i'm atand that was a kind of a running joke


3:43:57
Speaker 1 :and then and then there's so
 these passions and underneath it is the is the belief that you can be anything

3:44:03
Speaker 0 :you want to you can you know i told my
 kids this you know when they were young you know it wastough especially for my son so when nate
 was about five six years we knew nate wascolorblind you know my
 my wife's brothers are both colorblind it's really color deprived clearedapplying you see black and white
 he can't tell he has issues with greens reds browns it's funny if you're everaround someone like that
 because he'll go i'll go what are you looking at he goes right over there bythe red thing i'm like what are you
 looking at i go this i like he had a hat on onedagger which one are you gonna eat he
 had a hat in his hand it was green he goes i'm gonna get the green one i go ohthis one right here he goes no the one
 in my head i go nate that one's brown he's likeleave me alone dad he got the brown hat
 because to him it looked great yeah so he couldn't fly he came he saidi go what do you want to do nate you
 know you're talking to your kids and what do you want to use i want to be apilot no now i got to tell him because
 he's looking at me because i'm a pilot do you can't be a pilot he's like whycan't i be a pilot i said because
 you you got eye issues you know so you got to redirectand the other one was because i had i
 stopped flying i was 42 years old and i was like and it was my childhooddream so it's like a pro athlete i know
 exactly what it feels like when you know brett favre has to walkaway from the nfl when you still can do


3:45:09
Speaker 1 :it
 good choice of quarterback by the way the greatest of all time but whatever

3:45:13
Speaker 0 :so you you do when you look at it and
 you go i understand what those guys feel likewhen you have to walk away from
 something that you love and you think you can still do itum so i told them i said look
 i was talking to both my kids and i said you know find something that youwant to do that you love to do and that
 you can do your whole life and you should be able to do good thingsfor other people
 you want to be able to help other people that's what i saidso both of my kids and there's no one in
 my family both of my children one of them ismy daughter is a doctor doing residency
 in internal medicine right now and my son is in his third year andthey're both going to be doctors
 and until i look at it is you know people go oh you got two dogs i don'tcare i told my kids if you want to be a
 garbage man or you want to dig ditches i don't care just bebe the best ditch digger that you can be
 i said and be happy doing it because what you also find is thatwe are in this big pursuit of money
 money money money money might be that's what makes the world go around butwhat you realize and i'll go back to my
 grandfather who didn't have a lot of moneyand he was probably one of the most
 happy people on life and unfortunately he diedhe died at 65 he had a massive heart
 attack because he didn't tell that he he kind of knew what washappening and he just made the choice to
 to do and it was devastating to the entire familybut he didn't he didn't have a lot of
 money but i'll tell you what i know a lot of rich people who havefunerals and there's nobody adam
 yeah and my grandfather who's a beer delivery guy had i i iit literally it was like three miles
 long the pope it was crazy yeah who died that was because it was like he's acatholic he's just you know italian he
 goes you know who died the pope and i go nowthat's my grandfather and then the next
 funeral i went to was my aunt his sister and there was like you know 30 peopleand i looked at my mother and i said
 where's everybody at she goes oh no this is normalthis is what a normal funeral looks like
 so it's you know for young kids bottom line onebe nice kindness will get you i'm a big
 believer in karma kindness will get you a long way in theworld you know it's easy
 it's it it's easy to be nice it doesn't cost you anythingi said you know and get rid of the hate
 and number two is follow your dreams because everyone iscapable of everything and there's a
 there's a self realism like you know if you really have trouble withmath getting a phd in applied math is
 probably not something you're going to be able to do but understand yourselfwhat your own capabilities are and you
 know inside your heart don't let anyone ever tell you what you can and can't doyou have to determine that yourself
 and go for it and and and you can do anythingit's just it's it's a great the world's
 incredible

3:47:48
Speaker 1 :it really is let me ask the last yeah
 big ridiculous question uh so you've livedmuch of your life your career is kind of
 at the edge of life and death so let me ask kind of uhseveral different ways the same kind of
 question one d do you have you pondered yourmortality the finiteness of it
 and the bigger question to ask even in the context ofyour uh tic tac encounter
 is uh what do you think is the meaning of this uh thing we got going on herethe meaning of life
 human life in this sense

3:48:28
Speaker 0 :so let me start with have i pondered my
 own mortality yes quite often um and i don't get into myreligious beliefs or what i am
 but i will tell you that i do believe in god i've just seen too many things inthe world that i can't explain
 and some people will explain it by subconscious so i'll give you a storyand this kind of puts in the thing of
 do i fear death so i had a good friend of mine that i used to fly with we werestationed in japan together
 and japan had this incinerator that put all kinds of dioxins so there's a realhigh cancer rate for those that served
 on the base in atsugi japanhim and his wife had one son and their
 son passed away just before his 18th birthday of cancerand i was hanging out with i'll call him
 john and i was hanging out with john we werein oil and gas he'd come to the same
 company and we were doing an event together and hewas opening up to me
 because we were actually the demo pilots we do the demonstration for air showsand stuff
 and uh him and i were sitting there talking and uhhe was giving me the whole story and and
 how he really changed his look on life that we're only here for a finite timeand that we're all going to die
 well unfortunately after all that when it was really going him and his wife hadmoved to
 a location that fit their you know close to the water where they could do stuffand i won't say where
 um and he was doing what he loved to do and he got diagnosed with throat cancerand i was talking to him uh it was
 probably about maybe two months before he died umand i said dude hey you're sad you mean
 this is your friend and i'm kind of really bummed out andthis is the guy
 this is a guy that's dying of cancer and here's what he tells me he saysdave dude we're all going to die
 he goes but i have to look at it i have to make the best of the time that i haveand i said i understand that he goes
 with the exception of not being with my wife who he loveddearly
 he goes i'm okay with dying i've had a really good life andum about
 because actually the original announcement when he when he finallypassed away a buddy of mine called me
 because i don't do facebook and his wife had put it on facebook that hehad passed
 and about the day before he died for some reason i was thinking about himand i had a dream or i think it was a
 dream or an altered reality you can get intowhatever uh
 but he was there it was just him and i and i was really sad in the dream i wasactually crying
 and he was there and he was actually in his uniform he was in his whites anduh because he's a navy and we were just
 talking and he looked at me and he said and this is in my dream he's like daveit's all gonna be okay and this is this
 is like and this is a vivid conversation i have this people are don't think i'mweird about this but
 um but you know i know what my dream was andyou know maybe it's my subconscious
 creating the dream but in in reality to me this was real that it was put therefor a reason
 he's and he basically explained everything he's it's okayi'm gonna be fine my wife is fine he
 goes this is this is what's meant to be you know but you know and the bottomline was make use of every day that you
 have because you don't know and literally twodays later i find out that he passed


3:51:59
Speaker 1 :um so but ultimately
 he accepted the finiteness of it he did

3:52:04
Speaker 0 :well you have to
 and it's like i talk about you know money and job position and this and thati said you can get in any you know you
 can go to a company just remember when you want to be a vp of a company yousell your soul to the company
 you have to i said if you look i joke with people at work and i saidi said you know when you ever think that
 you're important or this guy has that i said when you're sitting on 93 or 95 128and you're sitting in traffic and we're
 stopped which doesn't happen right now because of covet but normally it's stopit's bumper to bumper and you're sitting
 here like i was coming down here by the gastank um
 when you're sitting there look left and look right you know and there can be alamborghini or an s550 mercedes and on
 the other side there could be some piece of crap carwe're all sitting on the same freeway at
 the same time trying to do the same thing which is justget home so we can be with our family
 because the most important thing that we haveit ain't money it ain't our job it's not
 our position i go because when it's all said and doneyou could be you know you can be with
 the exception of the presidents of the united states i meanname the vice presidents most people
 can't and eventually they're going to die oreventually you're going to see a statue
 of a guy from the 1700s in the boston area and you're going to go i don't evenknow who that guy was
 did he impact my life he probably did but eventually people forgetyeah you you realize what's important
 now and the one thing that you have is your family and your close friendsand that's that's
 it you can take all the money or everything else if you're down on yourluck
 you know who is going to be a we is joke who are your true friendsit's the person while there's there's
 ones that i won't say but you know hey you're broke down on a road in themiddle of nowhere and it's three o'clock
 in the morning who you gonna call is gonna get in their car withoutcomplaining and come and get you


3:53:46
Speaker 1 :and that's life those that is life the
 people you love

3:53:50
Speaker 0 :it's it's it's the people you truly care
 about and contrary to i have you know oh my god i got6 000 facebook friends you got about
 that many real friends that you can count on and that's it

3:54:01
Speaker 1 :everything else doesn't matter


3:54:03
Speaker 0 :no it doesn't matter it doesn't mean you
 might be nice i mean i have there's acquaintance friends that i'll doanything for and then come to my house
