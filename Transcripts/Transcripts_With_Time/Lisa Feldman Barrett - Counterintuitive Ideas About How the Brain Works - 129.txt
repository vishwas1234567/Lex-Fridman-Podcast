Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 lisa feldman barrett a professor of psychology atnortheastern university


0:00:07
Speaker 0 :and one of the most brilliant and bold


0:00:08
Speaker 1 :thinkers and scientists i've ever had
 the pleasure of speaking with she is the author of a book thatrevolutionized our understanding of
 emotion in the brain called how emotions are made and she'scoming out
 with a new book called seven and a half lessons about the brainthat you can and should pre-order now
 i got a chance to read it already and it's one of the bestshort whirlwind introductions to the
 human brain i've ever read it comes out on november 17th but againif there's anybody worth supporting it's
 lisa so please do pre-order the book now lisa and i agreed to speakonce again
 around the time of the book release especially because we felt that thisfirst conversation is good to release
 now since we talk about the divisive time we're living through in the unitedstates
 leading up to the election and she gives me a whole new way to think about itfrom a neuroscience perspective
 that is ultimately inspiring of empathy compassion

0:01:08

0:01:09
Speaker 1 :and love quick mention of each sponsor
 followed by some thoughts related to this episodefirst sponsor is athletic greens the
 all-in-one drink that i start every day withto cover all my nutritional bases that i
 don't otherwise get through my diet naturallysecond is magic spoon low carb keto
 friendly delicious cereal that i reward myself withafter a productive day the cocoa flavor
 is my favorite third sponsor is cash app the app i useto send money to friends
 for food drinks and unfortunately for the many bets i have lost to themplease check out these sponsors in the
 description to get a discount and to support this podcast as a side notelet me say that the bold first
 principles way that lisa approaches her study of the brain issomething that has inspired me ever
 since i learned about her work and in fact i invited her to speak atthe agi
 series i organized at mit several years agobut as a little twist instead of a
 lecture we did a conversation in front of the classi think that was one of the early
 moments that led me to start this very podcast it was scary and gratifyingwhich is exactly what life is all about
 and it's kind of funny how life turns a little moments like thesethat at the time don't seem to be
 anything out of the ordinary if you enjoy this thing subscribe on youtubereview it with five stars and apple

 friedman and now here's my conversation with lisa feldman barrett since we'lltalk a lot about the brain today do you
 think let's ask the craziest question do youthink there is other intelligent life
 out there in the

0:02:53
Speaker 0 :universe honestly i've been asking
 myself lately if there's intelligent life on this planetuh you know i ha i i have to
 think probabilities suggest yes and also secretly i think i just hope that'strue
 it would be really um i know scientists aren't supposed to have hopes and dreamsbut
 uh i i think it would be really cool and i alsothink it would be really sad if it if it
 wasn't the case if we really were alone that would bethat that would seem
 profoundly sad i think so it's exciting

0:03:29
Speaker 1 :to you not scary


0:03:31
Speaker 0 :yeah no you know i take a lot of comfort
 and curiosity it's a great it's a great umresource for dealing with uh stress
 so um i'm learning all about mushrooms anduh octopuses and you know all kinds of
 stuff um and so for me this counts i think inthe
 realm of awe but also i think i'm somebody whocultivates awe deliberately on purpose
 to feel like a speck you know i i find it a reliefoccasionally it feels small to feel
 small in a profoundly large and interestinguniverse


0:04:13
Speaker 1 :so maybe to dig more technically
 on the question of intelligence do you think it's difficult for intelligentlife to arise like it did on earth
 from everything you've written and studied about the brainhow magical of a thing is it
 in terms of the odds it takes to arise

0:04:33
Speaker 0 :yeah so you know magic is just
 don't get me wrong i mean i like i like a magic shirt as much as the next personmy husband was a magician at one time
 but you know magic is just a bunch of stuffthat we don't really understand how it
 works yet so i would say from what i understandthere are some major steps in the course
 of evolution that at the beginning of lifethe step from single cell to
 multicellular organisms things like that which arereally not known i think for me the
 question is not so much um could it you know what's the likelihoodthat it would happen again
 as much as um what are the steps and how long would ittake and if it were to happen again on
 earth would would we end up with the sameyou know menu of life forms that we
 currently have now and i think the answer is probably noright there's just so much about
 evolution that is stochastic and driven by chance but the question is

0:05:42
Speaker 1 :whether that menu would be equally
 delicious meaning like there'd be rich complexityof the kind of
 like would we get dolphins and humans or whoever else falls in that category ofweirdly intelligent
 seemingly intelligent however we define

0:06:00
Speaker 0 :that
 well i think that has to be true if you just look at the range of creatureswho've gone extinct
 i mean but if you look at the range of creatures that are on the earth now it'sincredible
 and you know it's sort of tried to say that but it actually is reallyincredible
 um particularly i don't know i mean animals there are animals that seemreally ordinary
 until you watch them closely and then they become miraculous you know likecertain types of birds
 which do very miraculous things uh um build you know bowers and do dancesand all these really funky things that
 are hard to explain uh with a standard evolutionary story althoughyou know um people have them birds are


0:06:45
Speaker 1 :weird they do a lot of for mating
 purposes they they have a concept of beautyi haven't quite maybe you know much
 better but it doesn't seem to fit

0:06:57
Speaker 0 :evolutionary arguments well it does fit
 well it depends right so i think you're talking about theevolution of beauty the um
 book that was written recently by was it fromum without his name richard from i think


0:07:09
Speaker 1 :

0:07:10
Speaker 0 :no i didn't oh it's a great book it's
 very controversial though because he is argues make an argument thatthe the question about birds and some
 other animals is why would they engage in such metabolically costlyum displays when it doesn't improve
 their fitness at all and the answer that he gives is theanswer that darwin gave
 which is sexual selection um not natural selection but you knowselection can occur for all kinds of
 reasons there could be artificial selectionwhich is when we breed animals right
 which is actually how darwin that that observation helpeddarwin come to the idea of natural
 selection oh interesting um and then there'ssexual selection
 um meaning and the argument that that um i think his name is fromuh makes is that um that it's the
 pleasure the selection pressure is the pleasure of female birdswhich as a woman and um as someone who
 studies affect that's a great answer i actually think there probablyis natural i think there is an aspect of
 natural selection to it which he maybe hasn't considered

0:08:18
Speaker 1 :but you were saying the reason we
 brought up birds is the the life we got now seems to be quite

0:08:23
Speaker 0 :yeah so you
 peek into the ocean peek into the sky there are miraculous creatureslook at creatures who've gone extinct
 and you know in science fiction uh storiesyou couldn't dream up something as
 interesting so my guess is that you know intelligent life evolves inin many different ways even on this
 planet uh there isn't one form of intelligence there's not one brain thatgives you intelligence
 there are lots of different brain structures that can give youintelligence
 so my guess is that the menagerie might not look exactly the waythat it looks now but it would certainly
 be

0:09:04
Speaker 1 :as as interesting but if we look at
 the human brain versus the brains or whatever you call themthe mechanisms of intelligence in our
 ancestors even early ancestors that you write about for example in yournew book
 what what's the difference between the the fanciest brain we got which isthe human brain
 and uh the ancestor brains that it came

0:09:30
Speaker 0 :from
 yeah i think it depends on how far back

0:09:33
Speaker 1 :you want to go
 you go all the way back right in your

0:09:36
Speaker 0 :

0:09:37
Speaker 1 :book
 so what's the interesting comparison

0:09:40
Speaker 0 :would you say well first of all i
 wouldn't say that the human brain is the fanciest brain we've goti mean an octopus brain is pretty
 different and pretty fancy and they can do some prettyamazing things that we cannot do you
 know we can't grow back limbs we can't change color and texture we can'tcomport ourselves and squeeze ourselves
 into a little crevice i mean these are things that we inventthese are like superhero abilities that
 we invent in stories right we can't do any of those thingsand so the human brain is certainly um
 we can certainly do some things that other animals can't dothat seem pretty impressive to us but
 but i would say that there there are anumber of animal brains which
 seem pretty impressive to me that can do interesting things andreally impressive things that we can't


0:10:28
Speaker 1 :do i mean with your work on how emotions
 are made and so on you you kind of repaint the the view of thebrain
 as um as less glamorous i suppose than you would otherwisethink or like i guess you draw a thread
 that connects all brains uh together in terms of homeostasis andall that kind of stuff


0:10:49
Speaker 0 :i yeah i wouldn't say that the that the
 human brain is any less miraculous than anybody elsewould say
 i just think that there are other brain structures which are also miraculousand i also think that there are a number
 of things about the human brain which we share with other other vertebratesother animals with backbones
 but um that are that we share these miraculous things but we can dosome things in abundance and we can also
 do some things with our brains together workingtogether that other animals
 can't do or at least we haven't discovered their ability to do it

0:11:30
Speaker 1 :yeah this social thing how i mean that's
 one of the things you write about uh what's uh how do you make senseof the fact uh like the book sapiens and
 the fact that we're able to kind of connect like network our brains togetherlike you write about i'll try i'll try
 to stop saying that uh is that is that like some kind offeature
 that's built into there is that unique to our human brains like how do you makesense of that


0:12:01
Speaker 0 :what i would say is that our ability to
 coordinate with each other is not unique um to humans there are lots of animalswho can do that and we um
 but what we do with that coordination is unique because of some of thestructural features
 in our brains and it's not that other animals don't havethose structural features
 it's we have them in abundance so you know the human brain is not largerthan you would expect it to be for a
 primate of our size if you took a chimpanzee and youex grew it to the size of a human
 that chimpanzee would have a brain that was the size of a human brainso there's nothing special about our
 brain in terms of its size there's nothing special about our brainin terms of
 the um the basic blueprint that builds our brain from an embryo is thebasic blueprint that builds all
 mammalian brains and maybe even all vertebrate brainsum it's just that because of its size
 and particularly because of the size of the cerebral cortex which is theum a part um that people mistakenly
 attribute to rationality yeah mistakenly

0:13:28
Speaker 1 :is that
 where all the clever stuff happens well

0:13:31
Speaker 0 :no it really isn't
 and i will also say that lots of clever stuff happens in animals whodon't have a cerebral cortex but right
 um but uh but because of the size of thecerebral cortex
 and because of some of the features that are enhancedby that size that gives us the capacity
 to do things like build civilizations umand coordinate with each other not just
 to manipulate the physical world but to addto it
 in very profound ways like you know other animals can cooperate with eachother and use tools
 um we draw a line in the sand and we make countries and we even then wecreate you know uh we create citizens
 and immigrants

0:14:20
Speaker 1 :but also ideas i mean the countries are
 centered around the concept of like ideas well my well what do you

0:14:26
Speaker 0 :think a citizen is and
 and an immigrant those are ideas those are ideasthat we um impose on reality and make
 them real and then they have very very serious andreal effects
 physical effects on people what do you

0:14:40
Speaker 1 :think about the idea
 that a bunch of people have written about dawkins with memeswhich is like ideas are breeding like
 we're just like the canvas for ideas to breedin our brains so this kind of network
 that you talk about of brains it's just a little canvas for ideas tothen yeah eat against each other and so


0:15:02
Speaker 0 :on i
 i think it's a rhetorical tool it's cool touh think you know think that way so um i
 think it was michael pollan i don't remember if it was in the botanyof desire but it was in one of his early
 books on um on botany and gardening where he wrote aboutum and he wrote about uh you know
 plants sort of utilizing humans for their ownyou know evolutionary purposes which is
 kind of interesting you can think about a human gut in a sense as apropagation device for the seeds of you
 know tomatoes and what what have you so it's kind of cool um soi think
 i think rhetorically it's an interesting device but you knowideas are as far as i know
 invented by humans propagated by humans um so you know i i don't think they'reseparate from human brains in
 in any way although it would it is interesting toto think about it that way well of


0:16:06
Speaker 1 :course the ideas that are using your
 brain to communicate and write excellent booksuh and they basically picked you
 uh lisa as an effective communicator and and thereby are winning so that's aninteresting world view
 to think that there's particular aspects of your brainthat are conducive to certain sets of
 ideas and maybe those ideas will win out yeah

0:16:32
Speaker 0 :i think the way that i would say it
 really though is that there are many species of animals thatinfluence each other's nervous systems
 that regulate each other's nervous systemsand they mainly do it by physical means
 they do it by chemicals scent they do it by you knowso
 so termites and ants and bees for exampleuse chemical scents mammals like
 um like rodents use scent and they also use uh hearing audition and that littlebit of vision
 um primates you know non-human primates add visionright and
 i think everybody uses touch humans as far as i know are the only species thatuse
 ideas and words to regulate each other righti can text something to someone halfway
 around the world they don't have to hear my voice theydon't have to see my face
 and i can have an effect on their nervous system andideas the ideas that we communicate with
 words i mean words are in a sense a way for usto do mental telepathy with each other
 right i mean i'm not the first person to say that obviously buthow do i control your heart rate how do
 i control your breathing how do i control your actionswith words it's because those words are
 communicating ideas

0:17:53
Speaker 1 :so you also write i think let's go back
 to the brain you write that plato gave us the ideathat the human brain has
 three brains in it three forces which is kind of a compelling notion uhyou disagree
 first of all what are the three parts of the brainand uh why do you disagree


0:18:15
Speaker 0 :so plato's description of the psyche
 which for the moment we'll just assume is the same as a mindthere are some scholars who would say
 you know a soul a psyche a mind those aren't actually all the same thingin ancient greece but we'll just
 for now gloss over that so plato's idea was thatand it was a it was a description of
 really about moral behavior and moral responsibility in humansso the idea was that you know the human
 psyche can be described with an um a metaphor oftwo horses and a charioteer so one horse
 for instincts like feeding and fighting and fleeing andreproduction i'm trying to control my
 salty language which apparently they print in englandlike i actually tossed off of
 f s yeah f f okay yeah yeah i was like you printed that i couldn't believe youprinted that


0:19:20
Speaker 1 :

0:19:21
Speaker 0 :without like the stars or whatever no no
 no there was full print yeah they also printed the a b word andit was really


0:19:28
Speaker 1 :quite yeah anyways we should we should


0:19:31
Speaker 0 :uh learn something from england
 indeed anyways but instincts and then the other horserepresents emotions and then the cherry
 tier represents rationality which controlsyou know the two beasts right and
 um fast forward you know couple of centuries and uhin the middle of the 20th century there
 was a very popular view of brain evolution whichsuggested that you have this uh
 reptilian core like a lizard bra an inner lizardbrain for instincts and then wrapped
 around that evolved on layer on top of that evolveda limbic system
 for uh in mammals so the novelty was in a mammalian brainwhich uh bestowed mammals with uh gave
 them emotions the capacitive emotions and then um on top of thatuh evolved uh a cerebral cortex
 um which in in largely in primates but but verylarge
 in in humans um and it's not that i personally disagreeit's that as far back as the 1960s but
 really by the 1970s it was shown pretty clearlywith evidence from molecular genetics so
 peering into cells in the brain to look at themolecular makeup of genes that the brain
 did not evolve that way and the irony is thatum you know the the idea of the
 the three-layered brain with an inner lizard you know thathijacks your uh hijacks your behavior
 and causes you to do and say things that uh you would otherwise not or maybethat you will regret later
 that idea um became very popular was popularized byuh carl sagan in the dragons of eden
 which won a pulitzer prize in 1977 when it was already known prettymuch
 in evolutionary neuroscience that the whole uh narrative was a myth

0:21:46
Speaker 1 :so well the narrative is on the the way
 it evolved but do you i mean again it's that problem of itbeing a useful
 tool of conversation to say like there's a lizard brainand there's a like if i get overly
 emotional on twitter that was the lizard brain and so on uh

0:22:09
Speaker 0 :but do you no i don't think it's useful
 i think it's a

0:22:13
Speaker 1 :i think that is it is is it uh is it


0:22:16
Speaker 0 :useful is it accurate
 i don't think it's accurate and therefore i don't think it's usefulso i here's what i would say you know i
 think that um the way i think aboutphilosophy and science
 is that they are useful tools for living and in order to be useful tools forliving
 they have to help you make good decisionsthe try and brain as it's called this
 this three-layer brain the idea that your brain is like an already baked cakein and you know the cortex cerebral
 cortex is just layered on top like icing the idea that idea is the foundationof the law in
 most western countries it's the foundation of uheconomic theory and it
 largely and it's a great narrative it sort of fits ourintuitions about how we work but it also
 um it's in addition to being wrong it lets people off the hook for uhfor nasty behavior you know um
 and it also suggests that emotions can't be a source of wisdomwhich they often are in fact you
 you would not want to be around someone who didn't have emotions that would bethat's a psychopath right i mean that's
 not someone you you know want to want to really uh havehave that person deciding your outcome
 so i guess my and i could sort of go on and on and onbut my point is that
 um i don't think i don't think it's a useful narrative in

0:24:02
Speaker 1 :the end
 what's the more accurate view of the brain that we should use when we're

0:24:07
Speaker 0 :thinking about it
 i'll answer that in a second but i'll say that even our notion of what aninstinct is or what a reflex is is not
 quite right right so if you look at evidencefrom um ecology for example and you look
 at animals in their ecological context what you can see is that even thingswhich are
 reflexes are very context-sensitive um the the brains of those animals areexecuting
 so-called instinctual actions in a very very context-sensitive wayand so you know even when
 a physician you know takes the you know it's like the idea of your patellaruh reflex where they hit you know your
 patellar tendon on your knee and you you kick the the force withwhich you kick
 and so on in is influenced by all kinds of things it's it'sa reflex isn't like a robotic
 uh response and um so i think a better way is a way thatto think about how brains work is the
 way that um matches our best understanding our bestscientific understanding which i think
 is really cool uh because it's reallycounterintuitive so how i came to this
 view and i'm certainly not the only one whoholds this view i was reading
 work in on neuroanatomy and the the view that i'm about to tell you wassugges strongly suggested by that and
 then i was reading work and signal processing like by engineer electricalengineering
 and similarly it the work suggested that that the research suggested thatthe brain worked this way and
 i'll just say that i was reading across multiple literatures and they werewho don't speak to each other and they
 were all pointing in this direction and so far although some of the detailsare still
 up for grabs the general gist i think is i've not come across anything yet whichreally violates and i'm looking um
 and so the idea is something like this it's very counterintuitiveum so the way to describe it is to say
 that your brain doesn't react to things in the worldit's not it to us it feels like our eyes
 and our um our windows on the world we see thingswe hear things
 we we react to them um in psychology we call this stimulus responseso your face is your voice is a stimulus
 to me i receive input and then i react to ituh and i might react very automatically
 you know system one uh and uh oh but i also might execute some controlwhere i
 maybe stop myself from saying something or doing somethingand um more in a more reflective way
 execute a different action right that's system twothe way the brain works though is it's
 predicting all the time it's constantly talking to itselfconstantly
 uh talking to your body uh and it's constantlyum predicting what's going on in the
 body and what's going on in the world and making predictions andthe information from your body and from
 the world really confirm or correct those predictions so

0:27:32
Speaker 1 :fundamentally the thing
 that the brain does most of the time is justpredict like talking to yourself and
 predicting stuff about the world not like this dumb thing that just senses inresponse senses


0:27:45
Speaker 0 :yeah so the way the way to think about
 it is like this you know your brain is uh trapped in a dark silent box yeah

0:27:52
Speaker 1 :that's very


0:27:54
Speaker 0 :romantic of you um which is your skull
 and the only information that it receivesfrom your body and from the world right
 is through the senses through the sense organsyour eyes your ears and you have
 a sense sensory data that comes from your bodythat you're largely unaware of uh to
 your brain which we call interroceptive as opposed to exteroceptive which is theworld around you
 and but your brain is receiving sense data continuouslywhich are the effect of some set of
 causes your brain doesn't know the cause ofthese
 sense data it's only receiving the effects of those causes which are thedata themselves
 and so your brain has to solve what philosophers call an inverse inferenceproblem
 how do you know when you only receive the effects of something how do you knowwhat caused those effects so
 when there's a flash of light or a change in air pressureor a tug somewhere in your body
 how does your brain know what caused thoseevents so that it knows what to do next
 to keep you alive and well and the answer is that your brain hasone other source of information
 available to it which is your past experienceit can reconstitute in its wiring
 past experiences and it can combine those past experiencesin novel ways and so
 we have lots of names for this in psychology we call it memorywe call it perceptual inference we call
 it simulation it's also we call it concepts orconceptual knowledge
 we call it prediction basically if we were tostop the world right now stop time
 your brain is in a state and it's representingwhat it believes is going on in your
 body and in the world and it's predicting what will happennext
 based on past experience right probabilistically what's most likely tohappen
 and it begins to um prepareyour action and it begins to
 prepare your the prepare your experience based so it's anticipating the sensedata it's going to receive
 and then when that those data come in theyeither confirm that prediction and your
 action executes because the plan has already been madeor
 um it where there's some uh sense data that your braindidn't predict that's unexpected and
 your brain takes it in we say encodes it we have a fancy namefor
 that we call it learning your brain learnsand it updates its storehouse of
 knowledge which we call an internal model and uh that you so thatyou can predict better next time
 and it turns out that predicting and correcting predicting and correctingis a much more metabolically efficient
 way to run a system than constantly reacting all the timebecause if you're constantly reacting it
 means you have no you can't anticipate in any way what'sgoing to happen and so the
 the amount of uncertainty that you have to deal with isuh overwhelming to a nervous system


0:31:30
Speaker 1 :metabolically costly i like it


0:31:32
Speaker 0 :and so what is a reflex a reflex is when
 your brain doesn't check against the sense data that the potential costto you is so great maybe because
 you know your life is threatened that your brainmakes the prediction and executes the
 action

0:31:54
Speaker 1 :without checking yeah so but prediction
 is still at the core that's a beautiful vision of the brain i wonderfrom almost an ai perspective but just
 computationally is the brain just mostly a predictionmachine then
 like is the perception just the nice little feature added on top likethe
 both the the integration of new perceptual informationi wonder how big of an impressive system
 is that relative to just the big predictor model construction well i

0:32:25
Speaker 0 :think that we can
 we can look to evolution for that for one answerwhich is that when you go back you know
 550 million years give or take we you know the world was populated bycreatures really ruled by creatures
 without brains um and um you know that's a biologicalstatement
 not a political statement really world

0:32:49
Speaker 1 :war ii
 dinosaurs dumb you're talking about like

0:32:51
Speaker 0 :oh no i'm not talking about dinosaurs
 honey i'm talking way back further back than that umreally these they're these little
 little um creatures called uh amphioxus which is the modernit's a or a lancet that's the modern
 animal but it's an animal that scientistsbelieve is very similar
 to um our common the common ancestor that we shareuh with invertebrates um because
 uh basically because of the tracing back the molecular genetics and cellsand that animal had no brain
 it had some cells that would later turn into a brain but in that animal there'sno brain but that animal also had no
 head and it had no eyes and it had no earsand it had really
 really no senses for the most part it hadvery very limited sense of touch it had
 an eye spot for um not for seeing but just forum in training to circadian rhythm to
 light and dark and it had no hearing it had avestibular cell
 so that it could keep upright in the waterat the time approx we're talking
 evolutionary scale here so you know give or take some 100 millionyears or something
 but at the time you know what are the vertebrate like when of when a backboneevolved
 and a brain evolved a full brain that was when a head evolved with sensewith
 sense organs and when um that's when your viscera like internal systemsinvolved so
 the answer i would say is that um that sensesnurse motor neuroscientists people who
 study the control of motor behavior believe that senses evolved in theservice of motor action
 so the idea is that like what triggered the what triggered whatwas what was the big evolutionary change
 what was the big pressure uh that made it usefulto have eyes and ears and a visual
 system and an auditory system and a brain basically andyou know and the answer that um is
 you know commonly entertained right now is that it was predationthat when at some point an
 animal evolved that deliberately ate another animaland this launched an arms race between
 predators and prey and it became very useful to have sensesright so these these little antioxidants
 these little amphioxy you know don't really have theythey don't have an um they're not aware
 of their environment very much really they um uhand so being able to
 look up ahead and you know ask yourself you know is that you knowshould i eat that or will it eat me
 um is is a very useful thing so the idea um is that sense sense sense datais not there for consciousness it didn't
 evolve for the purposes of consciousness it didn't evolve for the purposes ofexperiencing anything
 um it evolved uh in the cert to be in the service of motor controlhowever
 maybe it's useful um this is why you know scientists sometimes uhavoid questions about why things evolved
 that this is what philosophers call this teleology youmight be able to say something about
 how things evolve but not necessarily why we don't reallyknow the why
 that's all speculation but the y is kind

0:36:40
Speaker 1 :of nice here this
 the interesting thing is uh that was the firstelement of social interaction is am i


0:36:48
Speaker 0 :gonna eat you or are you gonna eat me


0:36:49
Speaker 1 :

0:36:51
Speaker 0 :and for that


0:36:52
Speaker 1 :it's useful to be able to see each other
 sense each other that's kind of fascinating that therewas a time when life didn't eat each
 other

0:37:02
Speaker 0 :or they did by accident right so an
 amphioxus for example well um it kind of like gyrates in thewater
 and then it plants itself in the sand like a blade of like a living blade ofgrass and then it just
 filters uh whatever comes into its mouth right so it is it is eating but it's notactively
 hunting and when um the concentration of food decreasesit the amphioxus can sense this
 and so it basically wriggles itself randomly to some other spot whichprobabilistically will have more food
 than wherever it is so it's not really you know it's notguiding its actions
 um on the basis of it's not we would say there's no real intentional actionum in that in that in the traditional


0:37:58
Speaker 1 :sense speaking of intentional action
 and if the brain is put if prediction is indeeda core component of the brain let me ask
 you a question that scientists also hate is uh about free will so how does uhdo you think about free will much how
 does that fit into this into your view of the brain why does itfeel like
 we make decisions in this world this is

0:38:24
Speaker 0 :a hard q a
 scientists hate this because it's a hard it's a hard question we don't knowthey're taken aside
 i think i have free will i think i have taken aside but it iti don't put a lot of stock in my own
 intuitions or anybody's intuitions about the cause of things right our exone thing we know about the brain for
 sure is that the brain creates experiences for usmy brain creates experiences for me your
 brain creates experiences for you in a way that lures you to believe thatthose experiences
 actually reveals the way that it works right but it doesn't

0:38:58
Speaker 1 :so so you don't trust your own intuition


0:39:01
Speaker 0 :about
 not really not really no i mean no but but i amalso somewhat persuaded by you know i
 think dan dennett wrote at one point like um uh you know the philosopher dandennett wrote at one point that
 um it it's i can't say it as eloquently as him but itpeople obviously have free will they are
 obviously making choices so it's you know and so there is thisobservation
 that we're not robots and we can do some things like a little more sophisticatedthan an amphioxus so
 um so here's what i would say i would saythat your predictions your internal
 model that's running right now right that yourability to
 understand the sounds that i'm making and attach them to ideasis based on the fact that you
 have years of experience knowing what these sounds mean in a particularstatistical uh pattern
 right i mean that's how you can understand the words that are coming outof my
 mouth right i think we did this once before too didn't we when we were

0:40:09
Speaker 1 :i don't know i would have to access my


0:40:11
Speaker 0 :memory module i think when i was in your
 glen classic yeah i think we did it just like that actually so bravo

0:40:18
Speaker 1 :wow yeah i have to go look look back to
 the tape

0:40:21
Speaker 0 :yeah anyways the um the idea though
 is that your brain is using past experience and it canand it can use past experience in um
 so it's remembering but you're not consciously remembering it's basicallyre-implementing prior experiences
 as a way of predicting what's going to happen next and it can do somethingcalled conceptual combination which is
 it can take bits and pieces of the past and combine it in new waysso you can experience and make sense of
 things that you've never encountered before because you've encounteredsomething
 similar to them um and so a brainin a sense is not um
 just um doesn't just contain information it is information gaining meaning it cancreate it new information
 by this generative process so in a sense you could say well that maybe that'sthat's a source of free will but i think
 really where free will comes from or the kind of free will that i think is worthhaving a conversation about is um
 involves cultivating experiences for yourselfthat change your internal model
 when you were born and you were raised in a particularcontext that your mod your brain wired
 itself to your surroundings to your physicalsurroundings and also to your social
 surroundings so you were handed an internal modelbasically
 um but uh when you grow up the more control you have over yourwhere you are and what you do um
 you can cultivate new experiences for yourself and those new experiencescan change your internal model and you
 can actually um practice those experiences in a waythat makes them automatic meaning it
 makes it easier for the brain your brain to make them again andi think that that is something like
 what you would call free will you aren't responsiblefor the model that you were handed that
 someone you know your your caregivers uh cultivated a model in your brainyou're not responsible for that model
 but you are responsible for the one you have nowyou can choose you choose what you
 expose yourself to you choose uh how you spend your timenot everybody has choice over everything
 right but everybody has a little bit of choiceum and and so i think
 that is uh something that i think is arguably called free will

0:43:13
Speaker 1 :yeah there's this like the the ripple
 effects of the billions of decisions you make early onin life
 have are so great that uh even if it's noteven if it's like all deterministic just
 the amount of possibilities that are created and then the focusing of thosepossibilities into a single trajectory
 uh that somewhere within that that's free will even if it's all deterministicthat might as well be
 of just the number of choices that are possible and the fact that you just makeone
 trajectory to those set of choices seems to be likesomething like they'll be called free
 will but it's still kind of sad to think likethere doesn't seem to be a place where
 there's magic in there where it is all just a computer well

0:44:07
Speaker 0 :there's lots of magic
 i would say so far because we don't really understanduh how all of this is exactly
 played out at a i mean scientists are working hard anddisagree
 about some of the details under the hood of what ijust described but i think there's quite
 a bit of magic actually and also there's there's also um stochasticfiring of neurons don't they
 they're not purely digital in the sense thatthere is there's also analog
 communication between neurons not just digitalso it's not just with not just with
 firing of axons and some of that there's there are otherways to communicate and
 also um uh there's noise in the system and thenoise is there
 for a really good reason and that is the morevariability there is the more
 potential there is for your brain to be able to be information bearing soum basically you know there are some
 animals that have clusters of cells the only job isto inject noise
 you know into their um neural patterns

0:45:28
Speaker 1 :so maybe noise is the source of free
 will

0:45:29
Speaker 0 :so you can think about you can think
 about stochasticity or noise as as a source of free will or you canthink of
 of um conceptual combination as a source of free willyou can certainly think about um
 cultivating uh you know you can't reach back into yourpast and
 change your past you know people try by psychotherapy and so on butwhat you can do is change your present
 which becomes your past

0:46:03
Speaker 1 :

0:46:04
Speaker 0 :right think about that sentence so one
 way to think about it is that you're continuously this is a colleague of minea friend of mine said so what you're
 saying is that people are continually cultivatingtheir past and i was like that's very
 poetic yes you are continually cultivating yourpast
 as a means of controlling your future

0:46:26
Speaker 1 :so you think uh yeah i guess the the
 construction of the mental model that you use for predictionultimately contains within it your
 perception of the past like the way you interpret the past or even just theentirety of your narrative about the
 past so you're constantly rewriting the storyof your past
 oh boy yeah that's one poetic and also just awe inspiringwhat about the other thing you talk
 about you've mentioned about sensoryperception as a thing that like
 is just you have to infer about the sourcesof the thing that you have perceived
 through your senses so uh let me ask theanother ridiculous question is is
 anything real at all like how do we know it's real how do wemake sense
 of the fact that just like you said there's this brain sitting alone in thedarkness trying to perceive the world
 how do we know that the world is out there i

0:47:25
Speaker 0 :will be perceived yeah so i don't think
 that you should be asking questions like that without passing a joint

0:47:32
Speaker 1 :right no for sure yeah i actually did
 before this so i apologize

0:47:36
Speaker 0 :okay no well that's okay you apologize
 for not sharing that's okay so i mean here's what i would say what iwould say is that the reason why
 we can be pretty sure that there's a there there is thatthe the structure of the information in
 the world what we call statistical regularities insights and sounds and so on
 and the structure of the information that comes from your body it's notrandom stuff
 there's a structure to it there's a spatial structure and a temporalstructure
 and that spatial and temporal structure wires your brainso an infant brain is not a miniature
 adult brain it's a brain that is waiting for wiringinstructions from the world
 and it must receive those wiring instructionsto develop in a typical way so for
 example when a newborn is born when a newborn isborn when a when a baby is born um
 the baby can't see very well because the visual system inthat baby's brain
 is not complete the the retina of your eye which actually ispart of your brain
 has to be stimulated with photons of light if it's notthe baby won't develop normally to be
 able to see in in a neurotypical way same thing istrue for hearing
 the same thing is true really for all your senses so thepoint is that that
 the physical world the sense data from the physical worldwires your brain so that you have an
 internal model of that world so that your brain canpredict well to keep you alive and well
 and allow you to thrive that's

0:49:19
Speaker 1 :fascinating that the brain is waiting
 for a very specific kind of uh set of instructions from the world like notnot the specific but a very specific


0:49:30
Speaker 0 :kind of instruction yes
 so you scientists call it expectable inputthe brain needs some input in order to
 develop normally and so we're and we are geneticallyyou know we as i say in the book we we
 have the kind of nature that requires nurturewe we can't develop normally without
 sense input sensory input from the world andfrom the body
 and what's really interesting about humans andsome other animals too but really
 seriously in humans is the input that we needis not just physical it's also social
 we in order for an an infant a human infant to develop normallythat infant needs eye contact touch
 it needs certain types of smells it needs to becuddled it needs right so um
 without social input the brain it's that that infant's brainwill not wire
 itself in a neurotypical way and again i would saythere are lots of um
 cultural patterns of caring for an infant it's not like the infant has tobe cared for in one way
 um whatever the social environment is for an infant that it will will bereflected in that infant's
 internal model so we have lots of different cultures lots of differentways of rearing children
 and that's an advantage for our species although we don't always experience itthat way
 that is an advantage for our species but if youif you just you know feed and water a
 baby without all the extra social doodadswhat you get is a profoundly impaired
 uh human yeah but

0:51:25
Speaker 1 :nevertheless you're kind of saying that
 the physical reality has uh has a consistentthing throughout that keeps feeding
 these set of sensory information that ourbrains are constructed


0:51:43
Speaker 0 :for but yeah the cool thing though is
 that if you change the consistency if you change the statisticalregularities so prediction error
 your brain can learn it it's expensive for your brain to learn it and it takesa while to
 for the brain to get really automated with it but you know you umhad a wonderful conversation with david
 eagleman who just published a book about this yeah and gave lots and lotsof really very very cool examples
 some of which i actually discussed in how emotions were made but not obviouslyto the extent that he did
 um in his book which it's a fascinating book and it'sbut it it speaks to the point that
 your internal model is always under constructionand therefore you always
 can modify your experience i wonder what

0:52:30
Speaker 1 :the limits are
 like uh if we can if we put it on mars or if we put in virtual realityor if we sit at home during a pandemic
 and we spend most of our day on twitter and tick tocklike i wonder what where the breaking
 point like the limitations of the brain's capacity to uhto properly continue wiring itself


0:52:53
Speaker 0 :well i think what i would say is that
 there are different ways to specify your question right like one wayto specify it would be the way that
 david um phrases it which iscan we can we create a new sense like
 can we create a new sensory modality how hard would that be what are thelimits in doing that
 um and um but another way to say it is what what happens to a brainwhen you
 remove some of those statistical regularities right like what happens toa brain what happens to an adult brain
 when you remove some of thestatistical patterns that were there and
 they're not there anymore

0:53:38
Speaker 1 :you're talking about in the environment
 or in the actual like you remove eyesight for example or did

0:53:43
Speaker 0 :you well either way
 i mean basically one way to limit the inputs to your brain are to stayhome and
 protect yourself another way is to put someonein solitary confinement another way
 is to stick them uh in a nursing home another well not all nursing homes butyou know
 but there are some right which really aresome where peop people are somewhat
 impoverished in the interactions the end thissensory the variety of sensory
 stimulation that they get another way is that you lose a senseright but the point is i think that you
 know the human brain reallylikes variety to to say it in a
 you know like a pro you know sort of cartesian wayyou know variety is a good thing
 um for a brain and um uhthere are risks that you take uh
 when you restrict uh what you expose yourself to

0:54:53
Speaker 1 :yeah you know there's always talk of
 diversity the brain loves it to the fullestdefinition and degree of diversity


0:55:01
Speaker 0 :yeah i mean i would say the only thing
 basically human brains thrive on diversity the only place where weseem to have
 difficulty with diversity is with each otherright but we who wants to eat the same
 food every day you never would who wants to wear thesame clothes every day i mean
 my husband if you ask him to close his eyes he won't be able to tell you whathe's wearing
 he's just right he'll buy seven shirts of exactly the same style in differentcolors
 but they are in different colors right

0:55:31
Speaker 1 :it's not like how would you then
 explain my brain which is terrified of choice and therefore i worethe same thing every time


0:55:39
Speaker 0 :well you must be getting your diversity
 well first of all you are a fairly sharp dresser sothere is that but um so you're getting
 some reinforcement progressing the way that you dobut well your brain must get diversity
 in in other words in other places but i think we you knowthe the so there the two most expensive
 things your brain can do metabolically speakingis um is move your body
 um and uh learn something new so novelty that is diversityright comes at a cost a metabolic cost
 but it's a cost it's an investment that that gives returns and in generalpeople vary in how much they like
 novelty unexpected things some people really like it some peoplereally don't like it and there's
 everybody in between but in general we don't eat the samething every day
 we don't usually do exactly the same thingin exactly the same order in exactly the
 same place every day the only place we havedifficulty
 uh with diversity in is in each other and then we we haveconsiderable problems there
 i would say as a species let me ask uh

0:56:53
Speaker 1 :i don't know if you're familiar with
 donald hoffman's work about this like questions of reality what areyour
 thoughts of the possibility that the very thing we've been talking aboutof the brain wiring itself from birth
 to a particular set of inputs is just a littleslice of reality that there is something
 much bigger out there that we humans with our cognition cognitivecapabilities is just not even perceiving
 that the thing we're perceiving is just the crappylike windows 95 interface onto a much
 bigger richer set of complex physics that we're not even intouch with


0:57:38
Speaker 0 :well without getting too metaphysical
 about it i think we know for sure it doesn't have to be theyou know crappy version of anything but
 we definitely have a limited we have we have a set of senses that arelimited in very physical ways
 and we're clearly not perceiving everything there is to perceivethat's clear i mean it's just it's not
 that hard we can't without special why do we inventscientific tools it's so that we can
 overcome our senses and and experience things that we couldn'totherwise whether they are
 you know different parts of the uh visual spectrum the light spectrumor um things that are too
 microscopically small for us to see or too far away forus to see
 so clearly we're only getting a slice um and that sliceyou know the interesting or
 potentially sad thing about humans is that wewhatever we experience we think there's
 a natural reason for experiencing it and we think it's obvious and naturaland it must be this way
 and that all the other stuff isn't importantand that's clearly not true many of the
 things that we think of as natural are anything but we've cr they'recertainly real but we've created them
 they certainly have very real impacts but we've created those impactsand we also know that there are many
 things outside of our awareness that havehave tremendous influence on what we
 experience and what we do so there's no questionthat that's
 true i mean just it's it's um but the extent is how fantastic reallythe question is how fantastical is it


0:59:23
Speaker 1 :yeah like what you know a lot of people
 ask me i'm i'm not allowed to say this i think i'mallowed to say this uh i've
 eaten shrooms a couple times but i haven't gone the fulli'm talking to a few researchers and
 psychedelics it's an interesting scientifically place like what is theportal you're entering when you take
 psychedelics or another would ask is like

0:59:44
Speaker 0 :dreams whatever so let me tell you what
 i think which is based on nothing like this is based on my liferight so i don't
 your intuition it's based on my it's based on myi'm guessing now um based on what i do
 know i would say but i think that well thinkabout what happens
 so you're running your brain's running this internal model right and it's alloutside of your awareness really
 you see the you feel the products but you don't you don't sense theyou have no awareness of the mechanics
 of it right it's going on all the time umand so one thing that's going on all the
 time that you're completely unaware of is that um when your brain your brain isbasically
 asking itself figuratively speaking not literally right likehow is the scent given the last time i
 was in this sensory array with this stuff going on in my body and iand that this chain of events which just
 occurred what did i do next what did i feel nextwhat did i see next
 it doesn't come up with one answer it comes up with a distribution of itpossible answers
 and then there has to be some selection process and so youhave a network in your brain a
 subnetwork in your brain a population of neuronsthat helps to choose
 it's not i'm not talking about a homunculus in your brain or anythingsilly like that um this is not
 the soul it's not the center of yourself or anything like that but thereis um
 a a set of neurons that weighs the probabilities uh um um and and helpsto select
 uh or narrow the field okay and that that network is working all the timeit's actually called the control network
 the executive control network or you can call it a fronto parietalbecause the regions of the brain that
 make it up or in the frontal lobe and the parietal lobethere are also parts that belong to the
 subcortical parts of your brain it doesn't really matter the point isthat that there is this network and it
 is working all the time whether or not you feel in controlwhether or not you feel like you're
 expending effort doesn't really matter it's on all the timeexcept when you sleep when you sleep
 it's it's a little bit relaxed and so think about what's happening whenyou sleep when you sleep
 the extra the external world recedes the sense datafrom so basically your model becomes
 a little bit the tethers from the world are loosenedand this network which is
 involved in you know maybe weeding out unrealistic thingsis a little bit quiet so use
 your dreams are really your internal model that'sunconstrained by the immediate world
 except so you can do things that you can't do in real lifein your dreams right you can fly like i
 for example when i fly on my back in a dream i'm much fasterthan when i fly on my front
 don't ask me why i don't know when

1:02:53
Speaker 1 :you're laying and you're back in your


1:02:54
Speaker 0 :dream no
 when i'm in my dream and flying in a dreami am much faster flyer in the air very
 [Music]

1:03:03
Speaker 1 :i don't think i've flown for many years


1:03:06
Speaker 0 :well you must try it


1:03:08
Speaker 1 :i've i've thought i've uh flown uh i've
 fallen

1:03:11
Speaker 0 :that's scary yeah but you fl you're


1:03:12
Speaker 1 :

1:03:14
Speaker 0 :talking about like yeah
 i fly my dreams and i'm way faster right and you're better on my back way fasterum
 now you can say well you know you never flew in your life right it's conceptualcombination i mean i've flown in an
 airplane and i've seen birds fly and i've watched movies of people flying andi know superman probably flies i don't
 know if he flies faster on his back but

1:03:36
Speaker 1 :he's voice he's out of never he's lying


1:03:37
Speaker 0 :on his front right but
 yeah but anyways my point is that you know all of this stuffreally um all these experiences really
 become part of your internal model the thing is that when you're asleepyour internal model is still being
 constrained by your body your your brain's always attached toyour body it's always
 receiving sense data from your body you're mostly never aware of ituh unless you run up the stairs uh or or
 you know uh maybe you um are ill in some waybut you're mostly not aware of it which
 is a really good thing because if you wereyou know you'd never pay attention to
 anything outside your own skin ever againlike right now you seem like you're
 sitting there very calmly but you have a virtual whole thing drama right it'slike a
 like a like an opera going on inside your bodyand so i think that one of the things
 that happens when people take psilocybin ortake uh you know ketamine for example
 is that the tethers completely are completely removed yeah

1:04:48
Speaker 1 :yeah that's fascinating and then and


1:04:50
Speaker 0 :that's why it's helpful to have a guide
 right because the guide is giving you sense datato steer that internal model so that it
 doesn't go completely off the rails yeah i know

1:05:02
Speaker 1 :there's so again that wiring to
 the other brain that's the guide is at leasta tiny little tether exactly yeah
 let's talk about emotion a little bit if we couldemotion comes up often and i have never
 spoken with anybody who um who has a clarity about emotion from abiological and
 neuroscience perspective that you do and i'm not sure i fullyknow how to as a as a i mentioned this
 way too much but as somebody who was born in the soviet unionand romanticizes basically everything
 talks about love non-stop you know emotion is ai don't know what to make of it i don't
 know so maybe uh let's just try to talk aboutit i mean from a neuroscience
 perspective we talked about a little bit last timeyour book covers it how emotions are
 made but what are some misconceptions we writersof poetry
 we romanticizing humans have about emotionthat we should move away from before to
 think about emotion from both a scientific and anengineering perspective


1:06:19
Speaker 0 :yeah so there is a common view of
 emotion in the west the caricatureof that view is that um
 you know we have an inner beast right your limbic systemyour your inner lizard um we have an
 inner beast and that comes baked in to the brain atbirth so you've got circuits for anger
 atmosphere it's interesting that they all have english names these circlesbut um that that and they're there and
 they're triggered by things in the world and um then they cause you to do and sayand
 you know so when your fear circuit is triggered you widen your eyesyou gasp your
 heart rate goes up you prepare to flee orto freeze and these are
 these are modal responses they're not the only responses that you give but onaverage they're the prototypical
 responses that's the view and umthat's the view of emotion in the law
 that's the view you know that emotions are theseprofoundly unhelpful things
 that are obligatory kind of like reflexesthe problem with that view is that it
 doesn't comport to the evidence um and it doesn't really matterthe evidence actually lines up
 beautifully with each other it just doesn't line up with that view and itdoesn't matter whether you're measuring
 people's faces facial movements or you're measuringtheir body movements or measuring their
 peripheral physiology or you're measuring their brainsor their voices or whatever pick any any
 output that you want to measure and you know any system you want to measure andyou don't
 really find strong evidence for this and i say this as somebody whowho not only has reviewed really
 thousands of articles and run you know big metaanalyses which are statistical summaries
 of of published papers but also as someonewho
 has sent teams of researchers to small-scale culturesyou know remote cultures which are
 very different from urban large-scale cultures like ours andone culture that we visited and i say we
 euphemistically because i i myself didn't go because i only hadtwo research permits
 and i gave them to my students because i felt like it wasbetter for them to have that experience
 and more formative for them to have that experiencebut i was in contact with them every day
 by satellite phone and this was um to visitthe um hadza hunter-gatherers in
 tanzania who are not um anancient people they're a modern culture
 but they live in circumstances um hunting and foragingcircumstances that um are very similar
 in similar conditions to our ancestors uh hunting gathering ancestorswhen expressions of emotion were
 supposed to have evolved at least by one view of okay soi you know for many years i was sort of
 struggling with um this set of observations rightwhich is that i feel emotion
 and i see i perceive emotion in other peoplebut scientists can't find a single
 marker a single biomarker not a singleindividual measure or pattern of
 measures that will can predict how someone whatkind of emotional state they're in
 how could that possibly be how how can you possibly make sense of those twothings
 and through a lot of reading and a lot ofand immersing myself in different
 literatures i came to the hypothesis that the brainis constructing these instances out of
 more basic ingredients so when i tell you that the brain when isuggest you that what your brain is
 doing is making a prediction and it's askingitself figuratively speaking
 the last time i was in this situation andthis you know physical state what did i
 do next what did i see next what did i hear nextit's basically asking what in my past is
 similar to the present things which are similar to one anotherare called a category
 a group of things which are similar to one another as a categoryand a mental representation of a
 category is a concept so your brain is constructing categoriesor concepts on the fly continuously
 so you really want to understand what a brain is doing you don'tusing machine learning like
 classification models is not going to help you because the brain doesn'tclassify it's doing category
 construction and the categories change or you couldsay it's doing concept construction it's
 using past experience to conjure a concept which is a predictionand if it's using past experiences of
 emotion then it's constructing an emotionconcept
 your concept will be the content of it isism changes
 depending on the situation that you're in so for example if your brainuses past experiences of anger that you
 have learned either because somebody labeled them for you taught them to youyou observed them
 in movies and so on in one situation could be very different from yourconcept
 of for anger than another situation and this is howanger instances of anger are
 what we call a population of variable instancessometimes when you're angry you scowl
 sometimes when you're angry you might smile sometimes when you'reangry
 you might cry sometimes your heart rate will go upit will go down it will stay the same it
 depends on what action you're about to takebecause the way predict and i should say
 the idea that physiology is yoked to action is a veryold idea
 in in uh the study of the peripheral nervous system that's been known forreally decades and so
 if you look at what the brain is doing if you just look at the anatomyand you what here's the hypothesis that
 you would that you would come up with and i can go into the detailsi've published these details in in
 scientific papers and they also appear somewhat in how emotions are made myfirst book they
 are not in the you know seven and a half lessons becausethat book is is really not pitched at
 that level of explanation right it's just giving it'sreally just a set of
 little essays um but the evidence but what i'm about to say is actuallybased on on on scientific evidence
 when your brain begins to make form a prediction the first thing it'sdoing
 is it's making a prediction of how to change the internalsystems of your body your heart your
 cardiovascular system the control of your heart control of your lungsright a flush of of cortisol
 which is not a stress hormone it's a hormone that gets glucose into yourbloodstream
 very fast because your brain is predicting you need to do somethingmetabolically
 expensive and so so either that means either moveor learn okay and
 so your brain is preparing your body the internal systems of your bodyto execute some actions to move in some
 way and the and then it infersbased on those motor predictions and
 what we call visceral motor predictions meaning thethe the changes in the viscera that your
 brain is preparing to um to execute umyour brain makes an inference about
 what you will sense based on those motor movementsso your experience of the world
 and your experience of your own body are a consequence of those predictionsthose
 concepts when your brain makes a concept for emotionit's constructing an instance of that
 emotion and that is how emotions are made and

1:15:24
Speaker 1 :those concepts
 load in the predictions that are made includecontents inside the body contents
 outside the body i mean it includes other humans so justthis construction of a concept
 includes the variables that are much richer than justsome sort of um simple notion


1:15:51
Speaker 0 :yeah so our colloquial notion of a
 concept where um you know umwhere i say well what's the concept of a
 bird and then you list a set of features off to methat's that's people's understanding you
 know typically of what a concept is but if you go uh into the literaturein um cognitive science what you'll see
 is that the way that scientists have understood what aconcept is has really changed over the
 years so people used to think about a concept asum
 philosophers and scientists used to think about a concept as a dictionarydefinition for a category
 so there's a set of things which are similar out in the worldand um your concept
 for for that category is a dictionary definition of the featuresright the necessary insufficient
 features of that of those instances so for a bird um you know would be

1:16:47
Speaker 1 :

1:16:48
Speaker 0 :wings feathers right a beak yeah it
 flies whatever okay um that's called the classicalcategory
 and scientists discovered observed that actuallynot all instances of birds have feathers
 and not all instances of birds fly and so the idea was that you don'thave a single
 representation of necessary and sufficient features stored in your brainsomewhere instead what you have
 is a prototype a prototype meaning um you still have a singlerepresentation for the category
 one um but the features are like of the most typical instance ofthe category or maybe the most frequent
 instance but not all instances of the category have all thefeatures right they they have some
 graded similarity to the prototypeand then uh you know
 what um i'm gonna like incredibly simplify now alot of work
 to say that then a series of experiments were doneto show that in fact
 what your brain seems to be doing is coming up with a singleexemplar or instance of the category and
 reading off the um features when i ask you for theconcept
 so if we were in a pet store and i asked you what are the features ofa bird tell me the concept of bird
 you would be more likely to give me features of a goodpet and if we were in a restaurant
 you would be more likely you know like a budgie right ora canary if we were in a restaurant you
 would be more likely to give me the featuresof a bird that you would eat like a
 chicken and if we were in a park you'd be more likelyto give me uh in this country
 uh you know the features of a sparrow or a robinwhereas if we were in south america you
 would probably give me the features of a peacock because that's more commonor it's or it is more common there than
 here that you would see a peacock in such circumstances sothe idea was that really what your brain
 was doing was conjuringa concept on the fly that meets the
 function that the category is being put tookay yep okay
 then people started studying ad hoc concepts meaningum concepts that where the instances
 don't share any feat any physical featuresbut the function of the instances are
 the same so for example think about all thethings that can protect you
 from the rain what are all the things that can protect you from the rain

1:19:48
Speaker 1 :uh umbrella uh
 like this apartment right um your car not giving a damn

1:19:59
Speaker 0 :

1:20:00
Speaker 1 :like like a like a mindset yeah


1:20:03
Speaker 0 :right right so the idea is that the
 function of the instances is the same in a givensituation
 even if they look different sound different smell differentthis is called an abstract concept or
 a conceptual concept now the really cool thing aboutconceptual
 categories or conceptual concept yes conceptual category a conceptualas a category of things that are held
 together by a function which is called an abstractconcept or a conceptual category
 because the things don't share physical features they share functional featuresthere are two really cool things about
 this one is that's what darwin said a species wasso darwin is known
 for discovering natural selection but the other thing he really did whichwas
 really profound which he's less celebrated foris understanding that all biological
 categories have inherent variationinherent variation darwin
 wrote in the origin of species about before darwin'sbook a species was thought to be
 a classical category where all the instances of dogswere the same had exactly the same
 features and any variation from that perfect platonicinstance was considered to be error and
 darwin said no it's not error it's meaningfulnature selects on the basis of that
 variation the reason why natural selection ispowerful
 and can exist is because there is variationin a species and
 in dogs we talk about that variation in terms of thesize of the dog and the uh amount of fur
 the dog has and the color and the how long is the tail and how long isthis snout
 in humans we talk about that variation in all kinds of ways right including incultural ways
 so that's one thing that's really interesting about conceptual categoriesis that darwin is basically saying a
 species is a conceptual category and in fact if you look at moderndebates about
 what is a species you can't find anybody agreeing on what the criteria arefor a species because they don't all
 share the same genome we don't all share we don't there isn'ta single human genome
 there's a population of genomes but they're variable it's not unboundedvariation
 but they are variable right and the other thing that's really cool aboutconceptual categories is that um
 they are the categories that we use to make civilizationso think about money for example
 what are all the physical things that make something a currency is there anyphysical feature
 that all the currencies in all the worlds that's ever been used by humansshare


1:23:33
Speaker 1 :well certainly right but uh but what
 what is it uh is it definable you know so it's getting to the pointthat you're
 because you're making it function it's

1:23:42
Speaker 0 :the function right function it's that we
 trade it for material goods and that and we have to agree right weall impose on whatever it is
 salt barley little shells big rocks in the ocean that can't movebitcoin pieces of plastic mortgages
 which are basically a promise of something in the future nothing moreright
 all of these things we impose value on themand we all agree that we can exchange
 them for material goods

1:24:11
Speaker 1 :yeah and uh yes that's bril by the way
 you're attributing some of that to darwin

1:24:16
Speaker 0 :that he thought no i'm no i'm saying
 that because it's a brilliant view of

1:24:19
Speaker 1 :what a species is is the function


1:24:21
Speaker 0 :yeah what i'm saying is that what darwin
 darwin really talked about variation in um so if youread for example the biologist ernst
 mayer who was an evolutionary biologist andthen when he retired
 became a historian and philosopher of biologyand his suggestion is
 that darwin darwin did talk about variationhe vanquished what's called essentialism
 the idea that there's a single set of features that define any speciesand um out of that grew
 um really discussions of the function you know like some of thefunctional features that species have
 like they can reproduce uh off they can have offspring theindividuals of a species can have
 offspring it turns out that's not a perfect uhyou know that's not a perfect uh
 criterion to use but it's a functional criterion right sowhat i'm saying is that in cognitive
 science people came up with the idea they discovered the idea of conceptualcategories or
 ad hoc concepts these concepts that can changebased on the function they're serving
 right and um uh that it's theredarwin it's in darwin and it's also in
 the philosophy of social reality you can the way that philosophers talk aboutsocial reality just look around you
 i mean we impose we're treating a bunch of things as similar which arephysically different
 and sometimes we take things that are physicallythe same and we treat them as separate
 categories

1:25:58
Speaker 1 :but it feels like the number of
 variables involved in that kind of categorization is nearly infinite

1:26:04
Speaker 0 :no i don't think so because there is a
 physical constraint right like you and i could agreethat um we can fly in real life
 but we can't that's a physical that's a physical constraint that we can'tbreak right you and i could agree that
 we could walk through the walls right but we can't we could agree thatwe could eat glass but there's a lot of
 constraints but yeah we could agree that the virusdoesn't exist and we don't have to wear
 masks right yeah but you know physical reality stillholds the trump card right
 but still there's a lot of card well

1:26:39
Speaker 1 :

1:26:40
Speaker 0 :pun completely unattended but there you
 go that's a predicting brain for you um uh but but there's a tremendousamount of leeway
 yes yeah that's the point so what i'm saying is that emotions are like moneybasically they're they're like money
 they're like countries they're like um kings and queens and presidentsthey're like
 everything that we construct that we impose meaningon we take these physical signals and we
 give them meanings that um they don't otherwise have bytheir physical nature
 and because we agree yeah they have that function but the the

1:27:20
Speaker 1 :beautiful thing so maybe unlike money
 i love this similarity is it it's not obvious to me that this kind ofemergent agreement should happen with
 emotion because our experiences are so differentfor each of us humans
 and yet we kind of converge well in a

1:27:36
Speaker 0 :culture we converge
 but not across cultures there are huge huge differencesthere are huge differences in what what
 concepts exist what their um what they look like umso what i would say is that they feel
 like what what we're doing with our youngchildren
 as we as their brains become wired to theirphysical and their social environment
 right is that we are curating for them we are bootstrappinginto their brains
 a set of emotion uh concepts that's partly what they're learning andwe curate those for infants just the way
 we curate for them what is a dog what is a cat what is a truckwe sometimes explicitly label and we
 sometimes just use mental words when you know yourkid is you know throwing cheerios on the
 floor instead of eating them or your kid is crying when you know shewon't put herself to sleep
 or whatever you know we use mental words and um a word is thiswords with for infants words are these
 really special things that they help infants learn abstract categoriesthere's a huge literature
 showing that children can take things that don't look infants likeinfants really young infants
 pre-verbal infants can take if you label if i say to you and you're aninfant
 okay so i say lex lexi this yeah is a bling yeahand i put it down and the bling makes a
 squeaky noise and then i say unless he's excited by

1:29:19
Speaker 1 :

1:29:19
Speaker 0 :the way this
 is a bling and i put it down and it makes a squeaky noiseand then i say lexi
 this is a bling you as young as four months old will expectthis to make a noise a speaking noise
 and if you don't if it doesn't you'll be surprised because it violated yourexpectation
 right i'm building for you an internal modelof a bling yeah okay infants can do this
 really really at a young age and so there's no reason to believethat they couldn't learn emotion
 categories and concepts in the same way and in in one and what happens when yougo to a new culture when you go to a new
 culture you have to do what's called emotionacculturation so my colleague bacia
 mosquita in belgium studies emotion acculturation shestudies how when people move from one
 culture to another how do they learn the emotion conceptsof that culture
 how do they learn to make sense of their owninternal sensations and also the
 movements you know the rays of an eyebrow the tiltof a head how do they
 learn to make sense of cues from other peopleusing concepts they don't have but have
 to make on the fly so that's the difference

1:30:40
Speaker 1 :between cultures
 let me uh open another door i'm not sure i want to openbut difference between men and women
 is there um difference between the emotional livesof those two categories of biological
 systems

1:30:57
Speaker 0 :so here's what i would say you know we
 did a series of studies um uh in the 1990s wherewe asked men and women to tell us about
 their emotional lives and women described themselves as muchmore emotional than men
 they believed that they were more emotional than men and men agreedwomen are much more emotional than men
 okay and then we gave them little handheld computersthese were little hewlett-packard
 computers they fit in the palm of your handa couple of pen they weighed a couple of
 pounds so this was like pre-palm pilot even like this wasyou know 1990s and like early
 and um we um asked them we would you know ping themlike 10 times a day and just ask them to
 report how they were feeling which is called experience sampling sowe experience sampled
 and and then at the end and then we looked at their reports andwe found is that men and women basically
 didn't differ and there were some people who werereally
 had many more instances of emotion so they wereyou know um they were treading
 uh water in a tumultuous sea of emotion and then there were other people whowere like
 floating tranquilly you know in a lake it wasreally not perturbed very often and and
 everyone in between but there were no difference between menand women
 and the really interesting thing is at the end of the sampling periodwe asked people um so
 reflect over the past two weeks and tell it so you know we've been now pingingpeople like
 again and again and again right so tell us how emotional do you think you areno change from the beginning so men
 and women believe that they are they believe that they aredifferent and when they are looking at
 other people they make different inferences aboutemotion
 if a man if a man is scowling like if you and i were togetherand some so somebody's watching this
 okay and um yeah hey

1:33:10
Speaker 1 :when you look at the camera


1:33:13
Speaker 0 :um if you and i
 make exactly the same set of facial movementswhen people look at you both men and
 women look at you they are more likely to think oh he'sreacting to the situation
 and when they look at me they'll say oh she's having an emotion she'syou know yeah and i wrote about this
 actually um uh right beforethe 2016 election


1:33:46
Speaker 1 :you know what maybe i could confess let
 me try to carefully confess but you are

1:33:51
Speaker 0 :really gonna


1:33:53
Speaker 1 :yeah that i'm that
 when i that there is an element when i see hillary clinton that there wassomething annoying about her to me
 and i just that feeling and then i tried to reduce that towhat what is that because i think the
 same attributes that are annoying about her when i seen other peoplewouldn't be annoying so i was trying to
 understand what is it because it it certainly doesfeel like that
 concept that i've constructed in my mind

1:34:30
Speaker 0 :well i'll tell you that i think
 well let me just say that um that that what you would predict about for examplethe performance of the two of them in
 the debates and i wrote an op-ed for the new york timesactually um before the second debate
 and it it played out really pretty much as i thought that it would on based onresearch it's not like i'm like a great
 fortune teller or anything it's just i was just applying the research which wasthat when a woman um
 a woman's people make internal attributions it's calledthey infer that the facial movements and
 body posture and vocalizations of a woman reflect her inner statebut for men they're more likely to
 assume that they reflect his response to the situation it doesn't say anythingabout him it says something about the
 situation he's in that's brilliant now for the thing thatyou are
 that you were describing about hillary clintonum i think a lot of people experienced
 but it's also in line with research which showsand and particularly research actually
 on um in about teaching evaluations is oneplace that you really see it
 where the expectation is that a woman will be nurturant and that a manthere's just no expectation for him to
 be nurturing so he's you know if he is nurturant he getspoints
 um if he's not he gets points right they're just different points rightwhereas for a woman
 especially a woman who's an authority figure she's really in a catch-22right because if she's serious she's a
 [ __ ] and if she's empathic uh then she's weak

1:36:09
Speaker 1 :right that's brilliant i mean one of the
 bigger questions to ask here so that's one example where our conconstruction of concepts


1:36:18
Speaker 0 :gets right but remember you're in
 trouble but so remember i said science is a science andphilosophy
 are like tools for living so i learned recentlythat if you ask me what is my intuition
 about what regulates my eating i will say carbohydrates i lovecarbohydrates i love
 pasta i love bread i love i just love carbohydratesbut actually research shows and it's
 beautiful research i love this research because it soviolates my own
 like deeply deeply held beliefs about myselfthat most animals on this planet who
 have been studied and there are many actually eat to regulate their proteinintake
 so you will overeat carbohydrates if you in order to get enough protein and thesethis research has been done with human
 very beautiful research with humans with crickets with like youknow bonobo i mean just like all these
 different animals not bonobos but i think like baboonsum now that i have no intuition about
 that and i even now as i regulate my eatingi don't i still i just have no intuition
 it just i can't i can't feel it what i feel is onlyabout the carbohydrates


1:37:36
Speaker 1 :it feels like you're regulating around
 carbohydrates not the protein yeah

1:37:38
Speaker 0 :but in fact actually what i am doing if
 i am like most uh animals on the planet i am regulatingaround proteins so
 knowing this what do i do i correct my behaviorto eat to to actually deliberately
 try to focus on the protein that this is the idea behind bias trainingright like
 if you um i alsodid not experience hillary clinton as
 the warmest candidate howeveryou can use consistent
 science since the consistent scientific findings toorganize your behavior that doesn't mean
 that rationality is the absence of emotion because sometimesemotion
 or scent anything feelings in general not the same thing as emotion um that'sanother topic
 um but you know our our source of of information and their wisdom andhelpful so i'm not saying that
 but what i am saying is that if you have a deeply held belief and the evidenceshows that you're wrong
 then you're wrong it doesn't really matter how confident you feelyou that confidence could be also
 explained by science right so it would be the same thing as if iregardless of whether someone is
 like charlie baker right regardless of whether somebody is a republican or ademocrat
 if that person has a record that you can seeis consistent with what you believe then
 that is information that you can act on

1:39:15
Speaker 1 :yeah and and then so try to i mean this
 is kind of what empathy is in open-mindedness is try to umconsider that the set of concepts that
 your your brain has constructed through which you are now perceiving theworld is
 not painting the full picture i mean this is now true for basically everit doesn't have to be men and women it
 could be basically the prism through which we pursue actually the

1:39:41
Speaker 0 :political discourse right absolutely so
 so here's what i would say um the you know there arepeople who scientists who will talk to
 you about cognitive empathy and emotional empathy andi i prefer to think of it
 i think the evidence is more consistent with what i'm about to say which is thatyour brain is always making predictions
 using your your own past experience and what you've learnedfrom you know books and movies and other
 people telling you about their experiences and so onand if your brain cannot make a concept
 to make sense of those anticipate what those sense data areand make sense of them you will be
 experientially blind so you know when i'm giving lectures topeople i'll show them like a blobby
 black and white image and they'reexperientially blind
 to the image they can't see anything in it and then ishow them a photograph and then i show
 them the image again the blobby image and then they see actually anobject in it but the art but the image
 is the same yeah it's there they're actually addingtheir predictions now are adding right
 or anything for example anybody who'slearned a language
 uh a second language after their first language also has this experienceof
 um things that initially sound like sounds that they can't quite make senseof eventually come
 to make they eventually come to make sense of them and in fact there arereally cool examples
 of people who are like born blind because they have cataractsor um they have corneal damage so that
 no light is reaching the brain and then they have anoperation
 and then light reaches the brain and they can't seefor days and weeks and sometimes
 years they have they are experientially blind to certain thingsso what happens with empathy right is
 that your brain is making a prediction and if it doesn'tif it doesn't have the capacity
 to um make it doesn't if you don't share ifyou're not similar
 remember you mean you know categories areinstances which are similar in some way
 if you are not similar enough to that person youwill have a hard time making a
 prediction about what they feel you will be experientially blind to whatthey feel
 in the united states children of color are under prescribed medicineby their physicians this
 is been documented it's not that the physiciansare racist necessarily
 but they might be experientially blind the same thing is true of malephysicians with female patients
 i could tell you some hair-raising storiesreally that where people die as a
 consequence of a physician making the wronginference the wrong prediction because
 of being experientially blind so we areyou know empathy is not um it's not
 magic it's we make inferences about each otherabout what each other's feeling and
 thinking in this culture more than there are somecultures where
 you know people have what's called opacity of mind where theywill make a prediction about someone
 else's actions but they're not inferring anything about the internal state ofthat person
 but in our culture we're constantly making inferences what is this personthinking what is and we're not doing it
 necessarily consciously but it's doing it really automatically using ourpredictions what we know and
 if you expose yourself to information which is very different fromsomebody else i mean
 really what we have is we have different cultures in thisin this country right now that are there
 are a number of reasons for this i mean part of it is i don'tknow if you saw the social dilemma the
 the netflix um uh part about it yeah it's a greatit's really great um documentary and uh


1:44:21
Speaker 1 :about what social networks are doing to
 our society yeah yeah

1:44:23
Speaker 0 :but you know nothing no phenomenon has a
 a simple single cause there are multiple small causes which all add up to aperfect storm that's
 that's just you know how most things workand so the fact that machine learning
 algorithms are serving people up information on social media that isconsistent with what they've already
 viewed and making you know umis part of the reason that you have
 these silos but it's not the only reason why you have these silos i think thereare other
 there are other things afoot that uh enhance um people's inability toeven have a decent conversation yeah i


1:45:13
Speaker 1 :mean okay so
 so many things you said are just brilliant so the experimentexperiential blindness but also from my
 perspective like i i preach and i try to practiceempathy a lot and something about the
 way you've explained it makes me almost see it as a kind ofexercise that we should all do
 like to train like to add experiences to the brain to expand this capacity topredict more effectively absolutely so
 like what like what i do is kind of like a methodacting thing which is
 i imagine what the life of a person is likeyou know just think i mean this is
 something you see with black lives matterand uh police officers it feels like
 they're both uh not both but i have because martialarts and so on i have a lot of friends
 who are cops they don't necessarilyhave empathy or visualize the experience
 of the other certainly currently unfortunately peoplearen't doing that with police officers
 they're not imagining they're not empathizingor putting themselves in the shoes of a
 police officer to realize how difficult that job is howdangerous it is how
 difficult it is to maintain calm and under so much uncertainty all this kindof


1:46:34
Speaker 0 :thing you know but there's more there's
 even that's all that's true but i think that there's even morethere's even more to be said there i
 mean like from a predicting brain standpointthere's even more that can be said there
 so i don't know if you want to go down that path or you canstrike on empathy but i will also say
 that one of the things that i was mostgratified by i
 still am receiving you know it's been threemore than three and a half years since
 how emotions are made came out and i'm still receivingdaily emails from people right so that's
 gratifying but one of the most gratifying emails i received wasfrom police officer
 in texas who told me that he thought that how motions are madecontained information that
 would be really helpful to resolving some of these difficultiesand he hadn't even read my op-ed piece
 about when is a gun not a gun and you know like usingthe what we know about the science of
 perception from predict from a predictionstandpoint like the brain is a predictor
 to understand a little differently what might behappening in these circumstances
 so there's there's a real what's hard about it's hard to talk about becauseeveryone gets mad at you when you talk
 about this like you know and um there is a way tounderstand this which has profound
 empathy for the sufferingof people of color and
 that definitely is in line with black lives matterat the same time as understanding the
 really difficult situation that police officersfind themselves in
 and i'm not talking about this bad apple or that bad apple i'm not talking aboutpolice officers who are necessarily
 shooting people in the back as they run awayi'm talking about the cases of really
 good well-meaning cops whohave the kind of predicting brain that
 everybody else has they're in a really difficult situationthat i think
 both they and the people who are harmed don'trealize like they just the the way that
 these situations are constructed i think it's justthere's a lot to be said there i guess
 is what i wanted is there something we

1:49:03
Speaker 1 :can try to say
 in a sense like what i'm from the perspective of the predictive brainwhich is a
 fascinating perspective uh to take on thisyou know the all the protests are going
 on there seems to be a concept of a policeofficer being built


1:49:22
Speaker 0 :no i think that police i think that
 concept is there

1:49:25
Speaker 1 :but it's is gaining strength so it's
 being re-um

1:49:31
Speaker 0 :i mean yeah it is sure it is there but i
 think yeah for sure i think that that's righti think that there's um
 there's a shift in the stereotype of what i would say is astereotype there's a stereotype of
 of uh black man in this country that's alwaysin movies and television not always but
 like largely um that many people watchi mean you know you think you're
 watching a 10 o'clock drama and all you're doing is like kickingback and relaxing but actually
 you're having certain predictions reinforcedand others not and what's happening
 what's happening now with police is the same thing um that there arecertain stereotypes of a police officer
 that are being abandoned and other stereotypes that are being reinforcedby by what you see happening all i'll
 say is that if you remember i mean there's a lot tosay about this really
 that you know regardless of whether it makes people mad or not i mean i justi the science is what it is um
 just remember what i said the brain is makes predictions about internalchanges in the body first and then motor
 it starts to prepare motor action and then it makes a prediction aboutwhat you will see and hear and feel
 based on those actions okay so it's also the case thatwe didn't talk about is that sensory
 sampling like your brain's ability to samplewhat's out there
 is yoked to your heart rate it's yoke to your heartbeatsthere are certain phases of the
 heartbeat where it's easier for you to seewhat's happening in the world than in
 others and so if your heart rate goes throughthe roof
 you will be less like you will be more likely to just go with your predictionand not correct based on what you
 what's out there because you're actually literally not seeing as wellor you will see things that aren't there
 basically

1:51:43
Speaker 1 :is there something that we could say in
 by way of advice for when this episode is released in thein the chaos of uh emotion sorry i don't
 know about a term that's just flying around on socialmedia what's um


1:52:02
Speaker 0 :well i actually think it is it is
 emotion in the following sense you know and it sounds a little bit likeit sounds a little bit like
 artificial when i and the way i'm about to say it but i really think that thisis what's happening
 you know one thing we haven't talked about isyou know brains evolved didn't evolve
 for you to see they didn't evolve for you to hearthey didn't evolve for you to feel they
 evolved to control your body that's why you have a brainyou have a brain so they control your
 body and the metaphor the there's a the scientific term forpredictively controlling your body is
 allostasis your brain is making um is attempting toit's tempting to anticipate the needs of
 your body and meet those needs before they ariseso that you can act as you need to act
 and the metaphor that i use is a body budgetyou know your brain is running a budget
 for your body it's not budgeting money it's budgeting glucose and salt andwater
 and instead of having you know one or two bank accounts it hasgazillions there are all these systems
 in your body that have to be kept in balanceand it's monitoring very closely
 it's making predictions about like when is it good to spend and when is it goodto save and what would be a good
 investment and am i going to get a return on my investmentwhenever people talk about reward or
 reward prediction error or anything to do with rewardor punishment they're talking about the
 body budget they're talking about your brain's predictions about whether or notthere will be a deposit
 or withdrawal so when you when your brain is running adeficit in your body budgets you have
 some kind of metabolic imbalance you experience that as discomfortyou experience that as distress when
 your brain when things are chaotic you can'tpredict
 what's going to happen next so i have thisabsolutely brilliant scientist working
 in my lab his name is um jordan terrioand he's published this really terrific
 paper on um a sense of should like why do we havesocial rules why do we
 you know adhere to social norms it's because if i make myselfpredictable to you
 then you are predictable to me and if you're predictable to methat's good because that that is less
 metabolically expensive for me novelty or unpredictability at theextreme
 is expensive and if it goes on for long enoughwhat happens is first of all you will
 feel really jittery and antsy which we describe as anxietyit isn't necessarily anxiety it could be
 just something is not predictable and you areexperiencing arousal because
 the chemicals that help you learn increaseyour feeling of arousal basically but if
 it goes on for long enough you will become depleted you will startto feel
 really really really distressed so what we haveis a culture full of people right now
 who are their body budgets are just decimatedyeah and there's a tremendous amount of
 uncertainty when you talk about it as depressionanxiety
 it makes you think that it's not about your metabolism that it's not about yourbody budgeting that
 it's not about getting enough sleep or about eatingwell or about making sure that you have
 social connections um it's you know it's you think thatit's something separate from that but
 depression anxiety are just a way of being in the worldthey're a way of being in the world when
 things aren't quite right with your predictions

1:56:08
Speaker 1 :that's such a deep way of thinking like
 the the brain is maintaining homeostasis it's actually

1:56:16
Speaker 0 :allostational


1:56:18
Speaker 1 :stasis i'm sorry uh and it's it's
 constantly making predictions and metabolically speaking it's verycostly to make novel
 like constantly be learning to making adjustmentsand then over time there's you know
 there's a cost to be paid if you're just yeah inin in a place of chaos where there's
 constant need for adjusting and learning and experience novel things and so part

1:56:46
Speaker 0 :of the problem here
 there are a couple of things like i said you know it's a perfect storm thereisn't a single cause
 right there are multiple cause multiple things that combine together it's acomplex
 it's a complex system multiple things part of it is that um people arethey're they're metabolically encumbered
 and they're distressed and in order to try tohave empathy for someone who is very
 much unlike you you have to forage for information youyou have to explore
 information that is novel to you and unexpected and that's expensiveand at a time when people feel what do
 you do when you are running a deficit in your bankaccount you stop spending
 what does it mean for a brain to stop spendinga brain stops moving very much stops
 moving the body and it stops learning it just goes withits internal model
 brilliantly put yep so empathy requires to have empathy forsomeone who is
 unlike you yeah requires learning and practice you're foragingfor information
 i mean it is something i talk about in my in the book in seven and a halflessons about the brain i think it's
 really important it's hard but it's hard i think it's you know itit's hard for people to have
 to be curious about views that are unlike their ownwhen um when they feel so encumbered
 and i'll just tell you i had this epiphany reallyi was listening to robert reich's
 the system he was talking about oligarchy versus democracyso oligarchy is where very wealthy
 people like extremely wealthy people shift power so that they become evenmore wealthy
 and even more insulated and from the you know thepressures of the common person um it's
 actually the kind of system thatleads to the collapse of civilizations
 if you believe jared diamond just say that but anyways i'm listeningto this and i'm listening to him
 describe in fairly decent detailhow the ceos of these companies
 there's been a shift in what it means to be a ceo and not not being no longerbeing a steward of the community
 and so on but like in the 1980s it sort of shifted to this other model of beinglike an oligarch
 and he's talking about how you know it used to be the case that umthat ceos
 uh made like 20 times uh what their um their employees madeand now they make about 300 times on
 average what their employees made so where did that money come from itcame from the pockets of the employees
 and they don't they don't know about it right no one knows about it they justknow
 they can't feed their children they can't pay for health carethey can't take care of their family and
 they worry about what's going to happen to theiryou know they're living like you know
 months a month basically any one big bill could completely youknow put them out on the street
 so there are a huge number of people living like this soall they what their experience they
 don't know why they're experiencing it so it'sand then someone comes along and gives
 them a narrative yeah well somebody else butted in line infront of you
 and that's why you're this way that's why you experience what you'reexperiencing just for a minute
 i was thinking i had deep empathy for people who have beliefsthat are really really really
 different from mine but i was trying really hard to see itthrough their eyes yeah
 and did it cost me something metabolically i'm sureyeah i'm sure but you had something in


2:01:01
Speaker 1 :the gas tank
 well i in order to allocate that i mean that's the question is like where didyou
 you what resources did your brain draw onin order to actually make that effort


2:01:14
Speaker 0 :well i'll tell you something
 honestly lex i don't have that much in the gas tank right now[Laughter]
 right so uh i i am surfing the stress that you know stress is justwhat is stress stress is your brain is
 preparing for a big metabolic outlay and it just keeps preparing and preparingand preparing and preparing


2:01:35
Speaker 1 :you as a professor you as a human both


2:01:38
Speaker 0 :right it's a for me this is a moment of
 existential crisis as much as anybody else democracyall of these things
 so in many of my roles so well i guess what i'm trying to sayis that um
 i get up every morning and i exercise i runi row i lift weights right you exercise
 in the middle of the day i saw your like yeah you know daily yeahi hate it actually you love it right you
 get it no i hate it i hate it but i do it religiouslyyeah why because it's a really good
 investment it's an expenditure that is a reallygood investment
 and so when i was exercising i was listening tothe book and when i realized the
 insights that i was sort of like playing around withlike is this does this make sense does
 this make sense i didn't immediately plunge into it i basicallywrote some stuff down
 i set it aside and then i did what i i prepared myself to make an expenditure idon't know what you do before
 you exercise i always have a protein shakealways have a protein shake because i
 need to fuel up before i make this really big expenditureand so i did the same thing
 i didn't have a protein drink but i um but i i did the same thing andfueling up can mean lots of different
 things it can mean talking to a friend about it it can meanum you know it can it can mean get
 making sure you get a good night's sleep before you do it it can mean lots ofdifferent things but i
 i guess i i think we have to do these things i uh yeah that

2:03:20
Speaker 1 :this i'm gonna re-listen to this
 conversation several times this is brilliant uhbut i do i do think about


2:03:28
Speaker 0 :

2:03:29
Speaker 1 :you know i've encountered so many people
 that can't possibly imagine that a good human being can vote for donald trumpand i've also encountered people
 that can't imagine that an intelligent person can possibly votefor a democrat and
 i i look at both these people many of whom are friendsand uh let's just say
 after this conversation i can see as they're predicting brains not willing toinvest
 the resources to empathize with the other side and i thinkyou have to in order to be able to like
 to see the obvious common humanity in us i don't know what the system is that'screating this division
 we can put it like you said it's a perfect storm it might be the socialmedia
 might i don't know what the hell i think

2:04:23
Speaker 0 :it's a bunch of things i think it's
 just there's an economic system which is disadvantaginglarge numbers of people there's uh
 a use of social media like if you you know if ihad to orchestrate or architect a system
 that would screw up a human body budget it would be the one that we live inyou know we don't sleep enough we eat
 pseudo food basically we are on social media too much which isfull of ambiguity which is really hard
 for a human nervous system right reallyreally hard like
 ambiguity with no context to predict it i mean it's likereally and then you know there are the
 economic concerns that affect large swaths of people in thiscountry i mean it's really
 you i'm not saying everything is reducible tometabolism not everything is reducible
 to metabolism but there if you combine all these thingstogether


2:05:19
Speaker 1 :it's helpful to think of it that way
 then somehow it's also uh somehow reduces the entirety of thehuman experience the same kind of
 obvious logic like we should exercise every day in the same kind of waywe should uh we should empathize every
 day

2:05:35
Speaker 0 :yeah you know there are these really
 wonderful wonderful programs for um for teens and um sometimes also forparents of
 people who've lost children in in wars and in conflicts in political conflictswhere they go to a bucolic setting and
 they talk to each other about their experiencesand um miraculous things happen
 you know so um uh you know it's easy touh it's easy to sort of
 shrug this stuff off as kind of pollyanna-ish you know like what's thisreally gonna do but
 um you have to think about when my daughter went to college i igave her advice i said
 uh try to be around people who let you be the kindof person you want to be
 you were back to free will you have a choiceyou have a choice it might seem like a
 really hard choice it might seem like a unimaginably difficult choice do youhave a choice
 do you want to be somebody who is wrapped in in fury and agonyor do you want to be somebody who
 extends uh a little empathy to somebody else and inthe process maybe learn something
 curiosity is the thing that it protects youcuriosity is the thing it's curative


2:07:12
Speaker 1 :curiosity on social media the thing i
 recommend to people um at least that's the way i've beenapproaching social media
 i i don't it doesn't seem to be the common approach buti basically uh
 give love to people who seem to also give love to others so it's thesame similar concept of
 surrounding by yourself by the people you want to becomeand i ignore sometimes block but just
 ignore i don't i don't add aggression to peoplewho
 are just constantly full of aggression and negativity and toxicitythere's a certain desire when somebody
 says something mean to to um to say something umto you know say why or try to alleviate
 the meanness and so on but what you're doing essentially isyou're and you're you're now surrounding
 yourself by that group of folks that have that negativityso even just the conversation
 so i you know i i think it's just so powerful to uh to put yourself amongstpeople
 who are yeah who whose basic mode of interaction is kindnessbecause uh i mean i don't know what it
 is but maybe i'm just it's the way i'm built isthat to me is energizing for the gas
 tank of that that i can pull to for sure when istart reading
 the rise and fall of the third reich and start thinking aboutnazi germany i can empathize with
 everybody involved i can start to think make these difficult uh like thinkingthat's required to understand our little
 planet earth well there is research to

2:08:52
Speaker 0 :back up what you said there's research
 that's consistent with your intuition thereyou know that there's research that
 shows that being kind to other people doingsomething nice for someone else
 is like making a deposit to some extent you know because i think um[Music]
 making a deposit not only in their body budgets but also in yourslike people feel good when they do good
 things for other people you know we are social animals weregulate each other's nervous systems
 for better and for worse right the best thingfor a human nervous system is another
 human and the worst thing for a human nervoussystem is another human
 so you decide do you want to be somebody who makes people feelwho who who makes people feel better
 or do you want to be somebody who causes people painand we are more responsible
 for one another than we might like or then me might want but remember whatwe said about social reality
 you know social reality so you you you know there are lots of differentcultural
 uh norms about uh you know independence oror you know collective you know nature
 of people but the fact is we have sociallydependent nervous systems
 we evolved that way as a species and in this countrywe prize individual rights and freedoms
 and that is a dilemma that we have to grapple with and we have to do it in away if we're going to be productive
 about it we have to do it in a way that umrequires engaging with each other and
 which is what i understand the you know the founding members ofthis country
 uh intended beautifully put let me ask a

2:10:57
Speaker 1 :few
 final silly questions so one we talked a bit about love but let meit's it's fun to ask somebody
 like you who can effectively from at least neuroscience perspectivedisassemble some of these romantic
 notions but what do you make of romantic love why dohuman beings
 seem to fall in love at least at least a bunch of80s hair bands have written about it uh
 is that a nice feature to have is that a bugwhat is it well i i'm really happy that


2:11:32
Speaker 0 :i fell in love i wouldn't want it any
 other way but i would say is that you the person

2:11:39
Speaker 1 :speaking or the neuroscientist


2:11:41
Speaker 0 :well i me that's me the person speaking
 but uh i would say as a neuroscientist babies are bornnot able to regulate their own body
 budgets because their brains aren't fully wired yetwhen you
 feed a baby when you cuddle a baby when youeverything you do with a baby impacts
 that baby's body budget and helps to wire that baby's bodybudget
 has to wire that baby's brain to manage eventually her own body budget to someextent
 that's the basis biologically of attachmenthumans evolved as a species
 to be socially dependent meaning you cannot manage your body budget onyour own
 without a tax that eventually you pay many years later in terms ofsome metabolic illness right loneliness
 when you break up with someone that you love or youlose them right it you feel like it's
 going to kill you but it doesn't but loneliness will killyou
 it will kill you approximately you know what is it seven years earlier i can'tremember exactly the exact number it's
 it's actually in the web notes to um seven and a half lessonsbut um social isolation loneliness
 will kill you earlier than you would otherwise die and the reason whyis that you're not you didn't evolve to
 manage your nervous system on your own and when you doyou pay a little tax and that tax
 accrues very slightly over time over a long period of time sothat by the time
 you're in you know middle aged or a little olderyou are more likely to die sooner from
 some metabolic illness from heart disease from diabetes from depressionum you're more likely to develop
 alzheimer's disease i mean it's the it you know it takes a long time forthat tax to accrue
 um but it does so yes i think it's a goodthing for people to um to fall in love


2:13:54
Speaker 1 :but i think the funny view of it is that
 uh it's clear that humans need the socialattachment
 to uh what is it manage their nervous system asas as you're describing and the reason
 you want to stay with somebody for a long time it's so you don't have isthe novelties very costly for


2:14:16
Speaker 0 :uh for well now you're mixing now you're
 mixing things now you're you know no you have to decide whetherbut what i would say is when you
 lose someone you love you um it feels like you've lost a part of youand that's because you have you've lost
 someone who was contributing to your body budgetwe are the caretakers of one another's
 nervous systems like it or not andout of that comes very deep feelings of
 attachment some of which are romantic love are you

2:14:51
Speaker 1 :afraid of uh your own mortality
 we two humans sitting here yeah do you think do you ponder yourimmortality i mean you're somebody who
 thinks about your brain a lot it seems one of the more umterrifying or i don't know i don't know
 how to feel about it but it seems to be one of the most definitive aspects oflife is that it ends it's a complicated


2:15:18
Speaker 0 :answer but i think the best i can do in
 a short snippet would be to say for a very longtime i did not fear my own mortality
 i feared the i feared pain and suffering so that that's what ifeared
 i feared being harmed or dying in a way that would be painfulum but i didn't fear having my life be
 over now as a mother ii think i i have fear i fear
 dying before my daughter is um ready to bewithout me that's what i fear
 it's that's that's really what i fear andfrankly honestly i fear my husband dying
 before me much more than i fear my own death

2:16:16
Speaker 1 :there's that
 love and social attachment again yeah

2:16:19
Speaker 0 :because i know i
 it's i know it's just gonna i'm gonna feel like i wish i was dead

2:16:26
Speaker 1 :yeah a final question about life
 uh what do you think is the meaning of it all

2:16:33
Speaker 0 :what's the meaning of life
 yeah i think that there isn't one meaning of life there's like manymeanings of life
 and you know you use different ones on different days but for medepending on the day depending on the
 day but for me i would say um sometimes the meaning of life is tounderstand
 to make meaning actually the meaning of life is to make meaningum sometimes it's that sometimes it's
 to um leave the world just slightly a little bit betterthan it like the johnny appleseed view
 you know sometimes um the meaning of life is umto um you know
 like clear the path for my daughter or for my students you know it's toyou know so sometimes it's that and
 sometimes it's just um you know like you knowyour moments where you're
 looking at the sky or you're you know by the ocean or sometimes forme it's even like
 i'll see a you know like a weed poking out of a crack and asidewalk you know
 and you just have this overwhelming sense of the like wonder ofthe um of the world like the world is
 like just like the physical world is so wondrous and you you just get veryimmersed in the
 mome in the moment like the sensation of the momentsometimes that's the meaning of life i
 don't i don't think there's one meaning of lifei think it's a population of instances
 just like uh just like any other category i don't

2:18:28
Speaker 1 :think there's a better way to end it
 lisa the first time we spoke is um i think if not the then one ofi think it's the first conversation i
 had that basically launched this pocket yeah that's actually the firstconversation i've had to launch this
