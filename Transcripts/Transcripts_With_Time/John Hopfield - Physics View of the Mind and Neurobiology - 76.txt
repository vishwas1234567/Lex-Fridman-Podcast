Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 john hopfield professor Princeton whose life's work weave beautifully throughbiology chemistry neuroscience and
 physics most crucially he saw the messy world of biology through the piercingeyes of a physicist he's perhaps best
 known for his work on associative neural networks now known as hopfield networksthat were one of the early ideas that
 catalyzed the development of the modern field of deep learning as his 2019Franklin medal in physics award States
 he applied concepts of theoretical physics to provide new insights andimportant biological questions in a
 variety of areas including genetics and neuroscience was significant impact onmachine learning and as John says in his
 2018 article titled now what his accomplishments have often come about byasking that very question now what and
 often responding by a major change of directionthis is the artificial intelligence

 with john hopfield biological neural networks andartificial neural networks is most


0:02:42
Speaker 1 :captivating and profound to you at the


0:02:43
Speaker 0 :higher philosophical level let's not get


0:02:49
Speaker 1 :technical just yet one of the things
 very much intrigues me is the fact that neurons have all kinds of componentsproperties to them and evolutionary
 biology if you have some little quirk and I even how a molecule works or howit still works and it can may mean use
 of evolution will sharpen it up and make it into a useful feature rather than aglitch and so you expect in neurobiology
 for evolution to have captured all kinds of possibilities of getting neurons ofhow you get neurons to do things for you
 and that aspect has been completely suppressed in artificial neural networks

0:03:38
Speaker 0 :so the glitches become features in them
 in the biological neural network they

0:03:45
Speaker 1 :they can look let me take one of the
 things that I used to do research on if you take things which oscillate theirrhythms which are sort of close to each
 other under some circumstances these things will have a phase transition andsuddenly is the rhythm will everybody
 will fall into step there was a marvelous physical example of that inthe millenium bridge across the Thames
 River about Bill about 2001 and pedestrians walking across pedestriansdon't walk synchronized they don't walk
 and lock lockstep but they're all walking about the same frequency and thebridge could say at that frequency in
 the slight sway made pedestrians tend a little bit to lock in the step masterwell the bridge was oscillating back and
 forth and the pedestrians were walking in step to it you could seewe made it at the bridge and the
 engineers made a simple-minded a mistake they had a feeling when you walk it'sstep step step and it's back at forth
 motion but when you walk it's also right foot left foot side to side motion andthe side to side motion for which the
 bridge was strong enough but it wasn't it wasn't stiff enough and as a resultyou would feel the motion and you'd fall
 under step with it and people were very uncomfortable with it they closed thebridge for two years really fully built
 stiffening for it no nerves look nerve cells loose action potentials you have abunch of cells which are loosely coupled
 together perusing action potentials of the same rate there'll be somecircumstances under which these things
 can lock together other circumstances which they won'twell they fire together you can be sure
 the other cells are going to notice it so you could make a computationalfeature out of this and you're in an
 evolving brain most artificial neural networks don't even have actionpotentials let alone have the Potala
 bility for synchronizing them and you

0:05:58
Speaker 0 :mentioned the evolutionary process so
 they're the evolutionary process that builds on top of biological systemsleverage is that the the weird mess of
 it somehow so how do you make sense of that ability to leverage all thedifferent kinds of complexities in the


0:06:23
Speaker 1 :biological brain well look in the part
 of the biological molecule level you have a piece of DNA which included anencode for a particular protein you
 could duplicate that piece of DNA and now one part of itencode for that protein but the other
 one could itself change a little bit and the start coding for a molecule which isjust slightly different now is that
 molecule was just slightly different had it in a function which helped any oldchemical reaction was as important to
 the cell you would go ahead and let that e try anevolution of slowly and improve that
 function and so you have the possibility of duplicating and then having thingsdrift apart one of them retain the old
 function the other one do something new for youand there's evolutionary pressure to
 improve look there isn't computers to adjust improvement has to do withclosing some companies openings others
 the evolutionary process looks a little different yeah oh similar timescale

0:07:34
Speaker 0 :

0:07:36
Speaker 1 :perhaps well or shorter in times to kill


0:07:39
Speaker 0 :companies close yeah go bankrupt and are
 born yeah shorter but not much shorter some some company lasts the century acouple but yeah you're right I mean if
 you think of companies a single organism that builds and you all know yeah it's afascinating dual correspondence there


0:08:01
Speaker 1 :between biological and companies have
 difficulty having a new product competing with an old fraud large yeahand when IBM built this first PC you
 probably read the dread the book they made a little isolated internal unit tomake the PC and for the first time in
 IBM's history they didn't insist that you build it out of IBM components butthey understood that they could get into
 this market which is a very different thing by completely changing theirculture and biology finds other markets
 in a more adaptive way he adds better at

0:08:44
Speaker 0 :it it's better at that kind of
 integration so maybe you've already said it but what to use the most beautiful

0:08:57
Speaker 1 :aspect or mechanism of the human mind


0:09:00
Speaker 0 :is it the adaptive the ability to adapt
 as you've described there's there some other little quirk that you particularly

0:09:09
Speaker 1 :like adaptation is everything when you
 get down to it but the difference there are differences between adaptation whereyour learning goes on on the over
 generation that over evolutionary time or your learning goes on at thetimescale of one individual who must
 learn from the environment during that individuals lifetime and biology hasboth kinds of learning in it and the
 thing which makes neurobiology hard is that a mathematical systems that werebuilt on this other kind of evolutionary


0:09:57
Speaker 0 :system what do you mean by mathematical
 system where where's the math in the

0:10:02
Speaker 1 :biology well when you talk to a computer
 scientist about neural networks it's all math the fact that biology actually cameabout from evolution the thing and the
 fact that biology is about a system which you can build in three dimensionsif you look at computer chips computer
 chips are basically two dimensional structures a 2.1 dimensions but theyreally have difficulty doing
 three-dimensional wiring biology biology is the neocortex is actually alsosheet-like and it sits on top of the
 white matter which is about ten times the volume of the gray matter andcontains all what you might call the
 wires but there's a huge the the effect the effect of computer structure on whatis easy and what is hard is immense
 so and biology does makes some things easy that are very difficult tounderstand how to do computationally on
 the other hand you can't do simple floating-point arithmetic because thoughit's awfully stupid yeah


0:11:23
Speaker 0 :and you're saying this kind of three
 dimensional complicated structure makes it's still math it still doing math thekind of math is doing enables you to
 solve problems of a very different kind

0:11:37
Speaker 1 :that's right that's right


0:11:40
Speaker 0 :so you mentioned two kinds of adaptation
 the evolutionary adaptation at the end the adaptation are learning at the scaleof a single human life which do you are
 which is particularly beautiful to you and interesting from a research and fromjust a human perspective and which is
 more powerful

0:12:04
Speaker 1 :I find things most interesting that I
 begin to see how to get into the edges edges of them and tease them apart alittle bit see how they work and since I
 can't see the evolutionary process going on I am in awe of it but I find it justa black hole as far as trying to
 understand what to do and so in a certain sense I'm a doll but I couldn'tbe interested in working on it


0:12:38
Speaker 0 :the human life timescale is however
 thing you can tease apart and study yeah

0:12:47
Speaker 1 :you can do there's developmental
 neurobiology which understands all of these connections and now the structureevolves from a combination of what the
 genetics is like and the real the fact that this is you're building a system inthree dimensions in just days and months


0:13:09
Speaker 0 :those early early days of human life are


0:13:16
Speaker 1 :really interesting they are and of
 course there are times of immense still multiplication there are also times ofthe craziest cell death in the brain is


0:13:31
Speaker 0 :during infancy it's turnover so what is


0:13:33
Speaker 1 :what what what is not effective which is
 not wired well enough to use the moment

0:13:41
Speaker 0 :throw it out it's a mysterious process
 from let me ask from what field do you think the biggest breakthroughs inunderstanding the mind will come in the
 next decades is it neural science computer scienceneurobiology psychology physics maybe
 math maybe literature [Laughter]

0:14:08
Speaker 1 :well of course I see the world always
 through a lens of physics I grew up in physicsand the way I pick problems is very
 characteristic of physics and of an intellectual background which is notpsychology which is not chemistry and so
 on and so on

0:14:27
Speaker 0 :at both the air parents of physicists


0:14:29
Speaker 1 :both of our parents were physicists and
 the real thing I gathered that was a feeling that the world is anunderstandable place and if you do
 enough experiments and think about what they mean and structure things that youcan do the mathematics of the relevant
 of the experiments you also be able to understand how things work but that was

0:14:55
Speaker 0 :that was a few years ago did you change
 your mind at all through many decades of trying to understand the mind ofstudying in different kinds of ways not
 even the minds just biological systems you still have hope the physics that you

0:15:15
Speaker 1 :can understand there's the question of
 what do you mean by understand of course when I taught freshman physics I used tosay I wanted to get physics to
 understand the subject to understand new this laws I didn't want them simply tomemorize a set of examples to which they
 knew the equations to write down to generate the answers I had this nebulousidea of understanding so the if you
 looked at a situation you can say oh I expect the bowl to make that trajectoryall right I expect so I'm into a notion
 of understanding and I don't know how to express that very well I've never knownhow to express it well and you run smack
 up against it well you choose these look at these simple neural Nets feed-forwardneural Nets which do amazing things and
 yet you know contain nothing of the essence of what I would have felt wasunderstanding attending is more than
 just an enormous lookup table let's

0:16:23
Speaker 0 :linger on that how sure you are of that
 what if the table gets read Liebig so i'm he asks another way thesefeed-forward neural networks do you
 think they'll ever understand

0:16:39
Speaker 1 :good answer that in two ways I think if
 you look at real systems feedback is an essential aspect of how these realsystems compute on the other hand if I
 have a mathematical system with feedback I know I can unlaid this and do it apart of it but but I have an exponential
 expansion and the amount of stuff I have to build if I could resolve the problem

0:17:08
Speaker 0 :that way so feedback is essential so we
 can talk even about recurrent recurrence but do you think all the pieces arethere to achieve understanding through
 these simple mechanisms like back to our original question what is thefundamental is there a fundamental
 difference between artificial neural networks and biological or is it just a

0:17:33
Speaker 1 :bunch of surface stuff suppose you ask a
 neurosurgeon when does somebody did yeah it'll probably go back to saying well Ican look at the brain rhythms and tell
 you this is a brain which has never could have functioned again this is oneanother but this other one is one which
 if we treat it well is still recoverable and then just do that by so manyelectrodes looking at simple like
 electrical patterns just don't look in any detail at all or what individualneurons are doing these rhythms are
 already absent from anything which goes on in Google

0:18:23
Speaker 0 :yeah but the rhythms but the rhythms


0:18:25
Speaker 1 :

0:18:27
Speaker 0 :would so well that's like comparing okay
 I'll tell you it's like you're comparing the the greatest classical musician inthe world to child first learning to
 play the question I'm at but they're still both playing the piano I'm askingis there will it ever go on at Google do
 you have a hope because you're one of the seminal figures in both launchingboth disciplines both sides of the of


0:19:00
Speaker 1 :the river I think it's going to go on
 generation after generation the way it has where what you might call the AIcomputer science community says let's
 take the following this is our model of Neurobiology at the moment let's pretendit's good enough and do everything we
 can with it and it does interesting things and after the while sort ofgrinds into the sand and you say Oh
 something else is needed from neurobiology and some other grand thingcomes in and enables you to go a lot
 further according to the sandakan everything it could be generations ofthis evolution I don't know how many of
 them and each one is going to get you further into what a brain does whateverthen in some sense passed the Turing
 test longer and more broad aspects and how many of these are good there aregoing to have to be before you say I've
 made something I've made a human I don't

0:20:14
Speaker 0 :know but your sense is it might be a


0:20:17
Speaker 1 :couple my senses might be a couple more
 yeah and going back to my brain waves of the word yesfrom the AI point of view if they would
 say ah maybe these are heavy phenomena and not important at all the first car Ihad no record of 1936 dodge Kobo 45
 miles an hour in the wheels was Jimmy

0:20:50
Speaker 0 :

0:20:50
Speaker 1 :yeah good good speedometer that
 now don't be designed at the car that way the cars malfunctioning to have thatbut in biology if you if it were useful
 to know when are you going more than 45 miles an hour you just capture that andyou wouldn't worry about where it came
 from yeah it'll be a long time before thatkind of thing which can take place in
 large complex networks of things is actually used in the computationlook-the how many transistors are there
 at your laptop these days actually I

0:21:34
Speaker 0 :don't know the number it's it's on a


0:21:37
Speaker 1 :scale of 10 to the 10 I can't remember
 the number yeah and all the transistors aresomewhat similar and most physical
 systems with that many parts all of which are selfs or have collectiveproperties yes soundly is an error
 Earthquakes what have you have collective properties wither there areno collective properties used in
 artificial neural networks in AI yeah

0:22:10
Speaker 0 :it's very


0:22:11
Speaker 1 :if biology uses them it's gonna take us
 two more generations of things to be the perfect people to actually dig in andsee how they are used what they mean see


0:22:22
Speaker 0 :you're very right might have to return
 several times to neurobiology and try to

0:22:32
Speaker 1 :make our transistors more messy yo-yo at
 the same time the simple ones whole concert will conquer big aspectsand I think one of the most biggest
 surprises to me was how well learning systems buzzer manifestingnon-biological how important they can be
 actually and you how important how useful they can be in a high so if we

0:23:02
Speaker 0 :can just take a stroll to some of your
 work that is incredibly surprising that it works as well as it does thatlaunched a lot of the recent work with
 neural networks if we go to what are now called hopfield networks can you tell mewhat is associative memory in the mind
 for the human side let's explore memory for a bit okay what

0:23:34
Speaker 1 :do you mean by associative memory is oh
 you have a memory of each of your friends your friend has all kinds ofproperties from what they look like is
 whether voice sounds like to where they went to college where you met them go onand on what what science papers they've
 written if I start talking about a five foot ten wirycognitive scientist that's got a very
 bad back it doesn't take very long for you to say are you talking about geoffhinton
 I never been I never mentioned the name or anything very particular but somehowa few facts are associated with this
 with a particular person enables you to get a hold of the rest of the facts yeahearned or not the dress that was another
 subset of them and is this the ability to link things together linkedexperiences together which goes under
 the general name of associative memory and a large part of intelligent behavioris actually just large associative
 memories at work as far as I can see

0:24:53
Speaker 0 :what do you think
 is the mechanism of how it works in the mind is it is it a mystery to you stilldo you have Inklings of how this
 essential thing for cognition works what

0:25:08
Speaker 1 :I made 35 years ago was of course a
 crude physics model to show the kayak Chua Li enable you to understand my oldsense of understanding as a physicist
 because you could say ah I understand why this goes to stable Statesit's like things going down downhill
 right and that gives you something with which to think in physical terms ratherthan only in mathematical terms so


0:25:42
Speaker 0 :you've created these associative
 artificial well that warp those right

0:25:47
Speaker 1 :and now if you if you look at what I did
 I didn't did all describe a system which gracefully learns I described as asystem in which you could understand how
 things how learning could link things together how very crudely it might learnone of the things which intrigues me as
 I reinvestigate that system now to some extent is look I see you I'll see youevery second for the next hour or what
 have you each each look at you is a little bitdifferent I don't store all those
 second-by-second images I don't store 3,000 images I somehow compact thisinformation so now I have a view of you
 which can which I can use it doesn't slavishly remember anything inparticular but it could PACs the
 information in those useful chunks which are somehow it's these chunks which arenot just activities of neurons from
 bigger things than that which are the real energies which are which are usefulwhich are useful to you


0:27:06
Speaker 0 :useful distal to you to describe to
 compress this information present in

0:27:12
Speaker 1 :such a way that if I get the information
 comes in just like this again I don't bother about their to rewrite it orefforts to rewrite it simply do not
 yield anything because those things are already written and that needs to be notlook this up has ever started somewhere
 already therapies not something which is much more automatic in the machine

0:27:41
Speaker 0 :hardware right so in the human mind how
 complicated is that process do you think so you've created feels weird to besitting with john hopfield calling them
 hot field networks but it is weird

0:27:55
Speaker 1 :yeah but nevertheless that's what


0:27:58
Speaker 0 :everyone calls them so here we are so
 that's a simplification that's what a physicists would do you and richardfineman sat down and talked about
 associative memory now if you as a if you look at the mind or you can't quitesimplify so perfectly do you let me


0:28:19
Speaker 1 :backtrack just a little bit yep biology
 is about dynamical systems computers are dynamical systems you can have if youwant to math the bottle biology bottle
 neurobiology what is the time scale there's a dynamical system in which youhave a fairly fast timescale in which
 you goes eight the synopsis don't change much during this computation so I'llthink of the synapses fixed and just do
 the dynamics of the activity or you can say the synapses are changing fastenough that I have to have the synaptic
 dynamics working at the same time as the system dynamics in order to understandthe biology
 most artists if you look at the feed-forward art revisional their ownads they're all done as learning is
 first of all I spent some time learning and not performing and I turned offlearning and I perform right that's not
 biology and so he is there look more deeply at neurobiology even asassociative memory I've got to face the
 fact that the dynamics of a synapse change is going on all the time and Ican't just get by by thing I'll do the
 academics of activity with fixed synapses so the the synaptic the

0:29:52
Speaker 0 :dynamics of the synapses is actually
 fundamental to the whole system yum yum

0:29:58
Speaker 1 :and there's no there's no there's
 nothing necessarily separating the time skills where the time skills can beseparate and it's neat for the
 physicists of the mathematicians point of view but it's not necessarily true inneurobiology New York you're kind of


0:30:13
Speaker 0 :dancing beautifully between showing a
 lot of respect to physics and then also saying that physics cannot quite reachthe the complexity of biology so where
 do you land or do you continuously dance between the two I continuously dance

0:30:33
Speaker 1 :between them because my whole notion of
 understanding is it you can describe to somebody else how something works inways which are honest and believable and
 still not described all the nuts and bolts in detail whether I can describewhether as ten to the 32 molecules
 colliding in the atmosphere I can stimulate whether that way or I pickenough machine I'll simulate it
 accurately it's no good for understanding but I just want tounderstand things I want to understand
 things in terms of wind patterns hurricanes pressure differentials and soon all things is there
 negative and the physicists physicists in me always hopes that biology willhave some things which can be said about
 it was are both true and for which you don't need all the molecular details ofthe molecules colliding that's what I
 mean from the roots of physics by

0:31:48
Speaker 0 :understanding so what did again sorry
 but hopfield networks help you understand what insight to give us aboutmemory about learning


0:32:00
Speaker 1 :they didn't give insights about learning
 they gave insights about how things having learned could be expressed howhaving learned a picture of a picture of
 you reminds me of your name that would put it describe a reasonable way ofactually doing the learning or only said
 if he had previously learned the connections of this kind of patternwould now be able to behave in a
 physical way with the day off I put the part of the pattern in here the otherpattern of the pet part of the pattern
 will complete over here I can understand that physics if the right learning stuffhad already been put in and you couldn't
 understand why then putting in a picture of somebody else would generatesomething else over here but it didn't
 out under did not have a reasonable description of the learning process but

0:33:04
Speaker 0 :even to forget learning I mean that's
 just a powerful concept that sort of forming representations that are usefulto be robust you know for error
 correction kind of thing so this is kind of what the biology does we're talking

0:33:22
Speaker 1 :about what my paper did was simply
 enable you there long there are lots of ways of being robust if you think of ita dividend amical system here you think
 of a system where a path is going on and in time and if you think for a computeris a computational path which is going
 out in a huge dimensional space of ones and zeros and an error-correcting systemis a system which if you get a little
 bit off that trajectory will push you back onto that trajectory again till youget to the same answer in spite of the
 fact that there were things though that the computation wasn't being ideallydone all the way along a line and there
 are lots of models for error correction but one of the models for errorcorrection is to say there's a family
 that you're following flowing down and if you push a little bit off the valleyit's just like water being pushed a
 little bit by a rock gets back and follows the course of the river and thenbasically the analog in the in the
 physical system went to enable to just say oh yes error free computation and anassociative memory are very much like
 like things that I can understand from the point of view of a physical systemthe physical system is can be under some
 circumstances an accurate metaphor it's not the only metaphor there are errorcorrection schemes which don't have a
 valley and energy behind them but those are correction schemes such amathematician may be able to understand


0:35:12
Speaker 0 :but I don't so there's a the physical
 metaphor that seems to a it seems to

0:35:19
Speaker 1 :work here that's right that's right so


0:35:20
Speaker 0 :these kinds of networks actually led to
 a lot of the work that is going on now and you're on that works artificialneural network so the follow-on work
 with restrictive Boltzmann machines and deep belief Netsfollowed on from the from these ideas of
 the hopfield network so what what do you think about this continued progress ofthat work towards now ree-ree vigor ated
 exploration of feed-forward neural networks and recurrent neural networksin convolutional neural networks and
 kinds of networks that are helping solve image recognition natural languageprocessing all that kind of stuff it's


0:36:05
Speaker 1 :always intrigued me one of the most
 long-lived all the learning systems is theBoltzmann machine which is intrinsically
 a feedback network and was the brilliance of inand Sadowski to understand how to do
 learning in that and it's still a useful way to understand learning andunderstand and the learning that you
 understand and that has something to do with the way that feed-forward systemswork but it's not always exactly simple
 to express that intuition but it always amuses me as he Hinton going back to thewill yet again on a form of the
 Boltzmann machine because really that which has feedback and interestingprobabilities in it this is a lovely
 encapsulation of something in computational something computational

0:37:07
Speaker 0 :

0:37:09
Speaker 1 :something both computational and
 physical computational and they very much related to feed-forward networksphysical in that Boltzmann machine
 learning is really learning a set of parameters for physics Hamiltonian orenergy function what do you think about


0:37:29
Speaker 0 :learning in this whole domain do you do
 you think the aforementioned guy Geoff Hinton all the work there withbackpropagation all the kind of learning
 that goes on in these networks how do you if we compared to learning in thebrain for example is there echoes of the
 same kind of power that back propagation reveals about these kinds of recurrentnetworks or is it something
 fundamentally different going on in the

0:38:05
Speaker 1 :brain I don't think the brain is as deep
 as the deepest networks go the deepest computer science networks and I dowonder where they're part of that depth
 of the computer science networks is necessitated by the fact that the onlylearning is easily done on a machine is
 his feed-forward and so there's the question of to what extent as thebiology which has some feed-forward some
 feedback been captured by something which is it got many more neurons butmuch more depth to the neurons


0:38:56
Speaker 0 :you know so party you wonders if the
 feedback is actually more essential than the number of neurons or the depth thethe dynamics of the feedback doesn't


0:39:07
Speaker 1 :ever have the feedback look if you don't
 have if you don't have feedback it's a little bit like a building a bigcomputer and having running up through
 one clock cycle and then you can't do anything do you put you reload somethingcoming in how do you use the fact that
 there are multiple clocks like how do I use the fact that you can close youreyes stop listening to me and think
 about a chessboard for two minutes without any input whatsoever yeah that

0:39:37
Speaker 0 :memory thing that's fundamentally a
 feedback kind of mechanism you're going back to something yes it's hard it's

0:39:48
Speaker 1 :

0:39:50
Speaker 0 :hard it's hard to understand so I don't
 respect let alone consciousness oh is

0:39:58
Speaker 1 :that a little own consciousness yes


0:40:00
Speaker 0 :because that's tied up in there too you
 can't just put that on another shelf

0:40:07
Speaker 1 :every once in a while like I interested
 in consciousness and then I go and I've done that for years and ask one of mybetters as it were their view on
 consciousness there's been interest in

0:40:21
Speaker 0 :

0:40:22
Speaker 1 :collecting them what let's try to take a


0:40:24
Speaker 0 :brief step into that room well that's


0:40:28
Speaker 1 :Marvin Minsky does you want to
 consciousness and Marvin said consciousness is basically overratedit may be an epiphenomenon after all all
 the things your brain does but your as they're actually hard computationsyou do not consciously and there's so
 much evidence that even the things the simple things you do you can makedecisions you can make committed
 decisions about them the neurobiology can say he's now committed he's going tomove the hand left before you know it so


0:41:14
Speaker 0 :his view that consciousness is not
 that's just like little icing on the cake the real cake is in the

0:41:21
Speaker 1 :subconscious yo-yo subconscious non
 conscious non-conscious that's the

0:41:25
Speaker 0 :

0:41:26
Speaker 1 :better word sir there's the it's only
 the Freud captured the other word yeah

0:41:30
Speaker 0 :it's that's a confusing word


0:41:32
Speaker 1 :subconscious Nicholas Chater wrote an
 interesting book I think the saw delivers the mind is flat flat and in aneural net sense you might have to be a
 flat is something which is of very broad they're all know without earlier thanthe layers in depth or as a deep brain
 would be many layers and not so broad in the same sense that if you push Minskyhard enough he would talk V of said
 consciousness is your effort to explain to yourself that would you have already

0:42:15
Speaker 0 :done yeah it's the weaving of the
 narrative around the things that already been computed for you that's right and

0:42:23
Speaker 1 :then so much of what we do for our
 memories of events for example if there's some traumatic event you witnessyou will have a few facts about it
 correctly done if somebody asks you about it you will weave a narrativewhich is actually much more rich in
 detail than that based on some anchor points you have of correct things andand pulling together general knowledge
 on the other but you will have a narrative and once you generate thatnarrative if you are very likely to
 repeat that narrative and claim that all the thingsyou have hidden are actually the correct
 things there was a marvelous example of that inthe Watergate / impeachment era of John
 Dean John Dean you're too young to know had been the personal lawyer of Dicksonand so John Dean was involved in the
 cover-up and John Dean ultimately realized the only way to keep himselfout of jail for a long time was actually
 to tell some of the truths about Nixon and John Dean was a tremendous witnesshe would remember these conversations in
 great detail and very convincingly tail and long afterward some of the some ofthe tapes the secret cases were for
 which these Don was Jean was recalling these conversations were published andone found out that John Dean had a good
 but not exceptional memory what he had was an ability to paint vividly and insome sense accurately the tone of what
 was going on by the way that's a

0:44:16
Speaker 0 :beautiful description of consciousness
 [Music] do you mean like where do you stand inyour today so perhaps has changed his
 day to day but where do you stand on the importance of consciousness in our whole

0:44:40
Speaker 1 :big mess of cognition is it just a


0:44:42
Speaker 0 :little narrative maker or is it actually
 fundamental to intelligence that's our

0:44:49
Speaker 1 :that's a very hard one but I asked
 Francis Crick about consciousness he launched forward a long monologue abouthandling the peas
 yeah and how Mendel knew that there was something and how biologists understoodthere was something in inherit
 which was just very very different and he is the effect that inherited traitsdidn't just wash out into a grey but
 it's this or this and propagated that that was absolutely fundamentals ofbiology and it took generations of
 biologists to understand that there was genetic and it took another generationor two to understand that genetics came
 from DNA but there but but but very shortly after Mendel thinking biologistsdid realize that there was a deep
 problem about inheritance any Francis blood of life would like to have saidand that's why I'm we're working
 unconsciousness but of course he didn't have any smoking gun in the sense ofMendel and that's the weakness of his
 physician that he read his his book but you wrote with Corey bank

0:46:16
Speaker 0 :yeah Christophe go on I find it


0:46:17
Speaker 1 :unconvincing for this first poking gun
 reason start going on and collecting views without actually having taken avery strong one myself because I haven't
 seen the entry point not seeing the smoking gun and the point of view ofphysics I don't see the entry point
 whereas whereas the neurobiology once they understood the idea of a collectivea and evolution of dynamics which could
 be described as a clock a collective phenomenon I thought ah there's a pointwhere what I know about physics is so
 different from any neurobiologist that I have something that I might be able tocontribute and right now there's no way


0:47:02
Speaker 0 :to grasp at consciousness from a physics


0:47:07
Speaker 1 :perspective from my point of view that's
 correct and of course people this is like everybody else do you think verybut early about things you have the
 closely is related question about freewill do you believe your freewillphysicists will give an offhand answer
 and then backtrack backtrack backtrack where they realized that the answer theygave must fundamentally contradict the
 laws of physics that natura answering

0:47:38
Speaker 0 :questions of freewill and consciousness
 naturally lead to contradictions from a physics perspective because iteventually ends up with quantum
 mechanics and then you get into that whole mess of trying to understand howmuch from a physics perspective how much
 is determined already predetermined much is already deterministic about ouruniverse there's lots of difference and


0:48:03
Speaker 1 :if you don't push quite that far you can
 say essentially all of Neurobiology which is relevant it can be captured byclassical equations of motion right
 because in my view of the mysteries of the brain are not the mysteries ofquantum mechanics for the mysteries of
 what can happen when you have a dynamical system driven system with 10to the 14 parts the bare complexity is
 something which is if the physical complex systems is at least as badlyunderstood as the physics of phase
 coherence and quantum mechanics can we

0:48:47
Speaker 0 :go there for a second you've talked
 about attractor networks and just maybe you could say what our attractornetworks and more broadly what are
 interesting network dynamics that emerge in these or other complex systems you

0:49:03
Speaker 1 :have to be willing to think in a huge
 number of dimensions because there's a huge number of dimensions the behaviorof a system can be thought of as just
 the motion of the point over time in those huge number of adventures rightand an attractor network is simply a
 network where there is a line and other lines converge on it in time that's theessence of an attractor Network that's


0:49:32
Speaker 0 :how you need a highly highly dimensional
 space

0:49:34
Speaker 1 :and the easiest way to get that is to do
 it in a high dimensional space where some of these dimensions provide thedissipation which base which a kind of a
 physical system trajectories can dig our contract everywhere they have to gettracked in some places and expand in
 others there was a fundamental classical theorem most statistical mechanics whichgoes under the name of liouville's
 theorem which says you can't contract everywhere after country if you contractsomewhere you were expand somewhere else
 do you and is in interesting physical systems you get driven systems where youhave a small subsystem which is the
 interesting part and the rest of the contraction of an expansion thephysicists say it's the entropy flow in
 this other part of the system but but basically attract your networks ourdynamics funneling downs of you can't be
 any so if you start somewhere in the dynamical system you will soon findyourself on a pretty well determined
 pathway which goes somewhere you start somewhere else you'll wind up on adifferent pathway but you don't have
 just all possible things you have some defined pathways which are allowed andonto which you will converge and that's
 the way you make a stable computer and that's the way you make a stablebehavior so in general looking at the


0:51:06
Speaker 0 :physics of the emergent stability in
 these not--when networks what are some interesting characteristics that whatare some interesting insights from
 studying the dynamics of such high dimensional systems most dynamical

0:51:24
Speaker 1 :systems supposed I'm done driven
 dynamical systems I driven there are couples I'm out to an energy source andso their dynamics keeps going because
 it's coupling to the energy source most of them it's very difficult as all tounderstand it all with the devil
 the dynamical behavior is going to be

0:51:47
Speaker 0 :you have to run it out you have to


0:51:49
Speaker 1 :running there's this there's a subset of
 systems which has what was a clean tone to the mathematicians as as the Alpen offunction and those systems you can
 understand convergent dynamics by saying you're going downhill on something orother and that's what I found without
 ever knowing what the alpha naught functions were in the simple model Imade in the early eighties was an energy
 function so you could understand how you get this channeling I'm as underpathways without having to follow the
 dynamics in an infinite detail you started rolling a ball as off of amountain that's gonna wind up at the
 bottom of a valley you know that it's true without actually watching the ballfall roll down there's certain


0:52:42
Speaker 0 :properties of the system that when you
 can know that that's right and not all

0:52:48
Speaker 1 :systems behave that way most don't


0:52:53
Speaker 0 :

0:52:55
Speaker 1 :probably both don't but it provides you
 with the metaphor for thinking about systems which are stable in the whoo tohave these attractors behave even if you
 can't find the idly up and a function behind them or an energy function behindthem it gives you a metaphor for thought


0:53:15
Speaker 0 :speaking of thought if I had a glint in
 my eye with excitement and said you know I'm really excited about this somethingcalled deep learning and neural networks
 and I would like to create an intelligence system and came to you asan adviser what would you recommend
 is it a hopeless pursuit she's knew all networks that she thought is it whatkind of mechanism should we explore what
 kind of ideas should we explore well you

0:53:51
Speaker 1 :look at this as the simple net worth for
 everyone networks they don't support multiplehypotheses very well as I have tried to
 work with very simple systems which do something which you might consider to bethinking thought has to do with the
 ability to do mental exploration before you make it take a physical action

0:54:22
Speaker 0 :almost they like we were mentioning
 playing chess visualizing simulating inside your head different outcomes

0:54:31
Speaker 1 :yellow young and now you could do that
 as a feed-forward Network because you've pre calculated all kinds of things but Ithink the way neurobiology does it
 hasn't pre calculated everything exactly as parts of a dynamical system in whichyou're doing exploration in a way which
 is there's a creative element like

0:54:59
Speaker 0 :there's an there's that there's there's


0:55:03
Speaker 1 :a creative element and in a
 simple-minded neural net you ever a constellation of instances from whichyou've learned and if you are within
 that space you know if a new fan new question is the question within thisspace you can actually rely on that
 system pretty well to come up with a good suggestion for what to do if on theother hand the query comes from outside
 the space you have no way of knowing how the system is going to behave there areno limitations on what could happen and
 so with the artificial neural network is always very much I have a a populationof examples the test set must be drawn
 from the equivalent population as the test as examples which are from apopulation which is completely different
 there's no way that you could expect to get the answer right

0:56:16
Speaker 0 :Meowth and so what they saw outside the
 distribution that's right that's right

0:56:21
Speaker 1 :and so if you see a ball rolling across
 the streets and dusk if there wasn't in your your trainingset the idea that a child may be coming
 close behind that is not going to occur with the neural lab and it is to our

0:56:40
Speaker 0 :there's something in your biology that
 allows that yeah there's there's

0:56:46
Speaker 1 :something in the way of what it means to
 be outside of the of the population of the training said the probability isthat the training set isn't just sort of
 the set of examples it's there's more to it than that and it gets back to my ownquestion of where's is it to understand
 something yeah you know is in a small

0:57:12
Speaker 0 :tangent you've talked about the value of
 thinking of deductive reasoning in science versus large data collection sosort of thinking about the problem but I
 suppose it's the physics side of you of going back to first principles andthinking but what do you think is the
 value of deductive reasoning in in a scientific process

0:57:36
Speaker 1 :well look there obviously scientific
 questions in which the route to the answer to it come through the analysisof one hell of a lot of data right


0:57:49
Speaker 0 :cosmology at honest and that that's


0:57:50
Speaker 1 :never written the kind of problem in
 which I've had any particular insight though I would say if you look atcosmology is was one of those if you
 look at the actual things that Jim Peebles one of this year's don't goprized for the vision physics ones from
 a local physics department the kinds of things he's done he's never crunchedlarge data never never never
 he's used the encapsulation of the work of others in this regard but I

0:58:27
Speaker 0 :ultimately boil down to thinking through
 the problem like what are the principles under which a particular phenomena

0:58:36
Speaker 1 :operates yeah and look physics is always
 going to look for ways in which you can describe the system and which risesabove the rises above the details and to
 the hard died the world biologists biology works because of the details andphysics to the physicists we want an
 explanation which is right in spite of the details and they will leavequestions which we cannot answer as
 physicists because the answer cannot be found that way there's a met sure if

0:59:13
Speaker 0 :you're familiar with the entire field of
 brain-computer interfaces has become more and more intensely researched anddeveloped recently especially with
 companies like neural link what Elon Musk you know I know they've always been

0:59:29
Speaker 1 :the endres both in things like getting
 the eyes to be able to control things or getting the thought patterns to be ableto move what had been a they connected
 limb which is now connected through a

0:59:48
Speaker 0 :computer that's right so in the case of
 neural they're doing thousand-plus connectionswhere they're able to do two-way
 activate and read spikes in your annual spikes do you have hope for that kind ofcomputer brain interaction in the near
 or maybe even far future of being able to expand the ability of the mind ofcognition or understand the mind as this


1:00:20
Speaker 1 :was watching things go when I first
 became interested in neurobiology most of the practitioners thought you wouldbe able to understand neurobiology by
 techniques which allowed you to record only one cell at a time once out yeahpeople like David Hoople very strongly
 reflected that point of view and that's been taken over by a generation a coupleof generations later
 a set of people who says not until we can record from 10 to the 4 or 10 to the5 at a time who we actually be able to
 understand how the brain actually works and in a general sense I think that'sright you have to look you have to begin
 to be able to look for the collective modes of the collective operations ofthings it doesn't rely on this action
 potential or death cell it relies on the collective properties of this set ofcells connected to this kind of patterns
 so on and you're not going to see did the thing what those collectiveactivities are without recording many
 cells at once and the question is how

1:01:38
Speaker 0 :many at once what's the threshold and


1:01:43
Speaker 1 :that's the that's the no and and because
 we pursued hard in the motor cortex the motor cortex does something which iscomplex and yet with the problem you're
 trying to address is very it's really simplenow neurobiology does it in ways the
 different from the way an engineer would do it an engineer would put in sixhighly accurate stepping motors are
 controlling a limb rather than 2,000 muscle fibers each of which has to beindividually controlled so understanding
 how to do things in a way which is much more forgiving and much more neural Ithink would benefit the engineering
 world the engineering world touch that's where their pressure sensor or to letvery them an array of of a gazillion
 pressure pressure sensors none of what you're accurate all of which areperpetually recalibrating themselves so


1:02:48
Speaker 0 :you're saying your hope is your advice
 for the engineers of the future is to the embrace the large chaos of a messyerror-prone system like those of the
 biological systems like that's probably the way to solve some of these I think

1:03:06
Speaker 1 :you'll be able to make better compete
 computations last robotics that way than by trying to force things into a into arobotics for joint motors are powerful
 and stepping motors are accurate but

1:03:25
Speaker 0 :then the physicists the physicists in
 you will be lost forever in such systems because there's no simple fundamentalsto exploring systems that are so large


1:03:38
Speaker 1 :and we also you see that yep there's a
 lot of physics and the navier-stokes equations the equations of nonlinearhydrodynamics huge amount of physics in
 them all the physics of atoms and molecules has been lost but it's beenreplaced or this other set of equations
 which is just as true as the equations of the bottle though those thoseequations are going to be harder to find
 in general biology but the physicist of me says there are probably someequations of there
 sort they're out there there they're out there and the physics is going tocontribute anything it may contribute to
 trying to find out what those equations are and how to capture them from thembiology would you say that's one of the


1:04:26
Speaker 0 :main open problems of our age is to
 discover those equations yeah if you

1:04:34
Speaker 1 :look at theirs molecules
 there's psychological behavior these two are somehow relatedthere are layers of detail they're
 layers of collectiveness and to capture this to capture that at some vague waitseveral stages on the way up to see how
 these things that can actually be linked together so it seems in our universe

1:05:04
Speaker 0 :there's a lot of a lot of elegant
 equations that can describe the fundamental way that things behave whichis a surprise I mean it's compressible
 into equations it's simple and beautiful but there isn't it's still an openquestion whether that link is equally
 between molecules and the brain is equally compressible into elegantequations but your ear sounds some well
 you're both a physicist and a dreamer you have a sense that yes I can although

1:05:39
Speaker 1 :I can only dream physics dreams physics
 shapes there was an interesting book called Einsteins dreams Forge alternatesbetween chapters on his life and
 descriptions of the way time might have been but isn't as linking between thesebeing of course the ideas that Einstein
 might have had to think about the essence of time as he was thinking abouttime so speaking of the essence of time


1:06:11
Speaker 0 :in neurobiology you're one human famous
 impactful human but just one human with a brain living the human conditionbut you're ultimately mortal like all of
 us has studying the mind as a mechanism change the way you think about your own

1:06:34
Speaker 1 :mortality it has really because as
 particularly as you get older in the body comes apart in various ways Ibecame much more aware of the fact that
 what is somebody is contained in the brain and out in the body that you worryabout burying and it is to a certain
 extent true that for people who write things down equations dreams notepadsDiaries fractions of their thought does
 continue to live after they're dead and gone after their body is dead and goneand there's a sea change in there going
 on in my lifetime between what if my father died when except for the thingsthat you're actually ridden by hymns
 that were very few facts about him will have ever been recorded and the numberof facts which are recorded about each
 and every one of us forever now as far as I can see in the digital world and sothe whole question of what is death may
 be different for people a generation to go in a generation or through ahead

1:08:07
Speaker 0 :maybe we have become immortal under some


1:08:11
Speaker 1 :definitions yeah yeah last easy question


1:08:14
Speaker 0 :what is the meaning of life looking back


1:08:20
Speaker 1 :

1:08:23
Speaker 0 :studied the mind a weird descendants of
 apes what's the meaning of our existence on this little earth Oh word meeting is

1:08:37
Speaker 1 :as slippery as the word understand


1:08:45
Speaker 0 :interconnected somehow perhaps is there


1:08:49
Speaker 1 :

1:08:52
Speaker 0 :it's slippery but is there something you
 despite being slippery can hold long enough to express all I've been amazed

1:09:01
Speaker 1 :at how hard it is to define the things
 in a living system in the sense that what a hydrogen atom is pretty much likeanother
 one bacterium is not so much like another like another bacterium even ofthe same nominal species in fact the
 whole notion of what as the species gets a little bit fuzzy and do species existsin the absence of certain classes of
 environments and pretty soon one winds up with with the biology which the wholething is living but whether there's
 actually any element of it which by itself would be said to be living isbecomes a little bit vague in my mind so


1:09:54
Speaker 0 :in a sense the idea of meaning is
 something that's possessed by an individual like a conscious creature andyou're saying that it's all
 interconnected in some kind of way that there might not even be an individualwe're all kind of this complicated mess
 of biological systems at all different levels where the human starts and whenthe human ends is unclear you know yeah


1:10:21
Speaker 1 :and we're the neurobiology where the oh
 you say that the your cortex does the thinking but there's lots of things thatare done in the spinal cord and so we
 say where's the essence of thought it's just going to be neocortexcan't be campy yeah maybe to understand


1:10:40
Speaker 0 :and to build thought you have to build
 the universe along with the the neocortex it's all interlinked throughthe spinal cord John is a huge honor
 talking today thank you so much for your timeI really appreciate it well thank you


1:10:58
Speaker 1 :for the challenge of talking with you
 and the interesting to see whether you can win a 5 in 5 minutes out of thatjust coherent sense to anywhere

 an Apple podcast supported on patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter at LexFriedman and now let me leave you with
 some words of wisdom from john hopfield in his article titled now what choosingproblems is the primary determinant of
 what one accomplishes in science i have generally had a relatively shortattention span and science problems thus
 i have always been on the lookout for more interesting questions either as mypresent ones get worked out or as it get
 classified by me as intractable give him my particular talents he then goes on tosay what I have done in science relies
 entirely on experimental and theoretical studies by experts I have a greatrespect for them especially for those
 who are willing to attempt communication with soin who is not an expert in thefield I would only add that experts are
 good at answering questions if you're brash enough ask your owntoo much about how you found them
 for listening and hope to see you next
