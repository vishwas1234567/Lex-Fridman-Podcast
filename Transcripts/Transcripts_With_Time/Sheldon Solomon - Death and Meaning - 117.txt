Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 sheldon solomon a social psychologist a philosopherco-developer of terror management theory
 and co-author of the warm at the core on the role of death and life he furthercarried the ideas of ernest
 becker that can crudely summarize as the idea that our fear of deathis at the core of the human condition
 and the driver of most of the creations ofhuman civilization

 let me say as a side note that ernest becker's bookdenial of death had a big impact on my
 thinking about human cognition consciousness and the deep oceancurrents of our mind
 that are behind the surface behaviors we observemany people have told me that they think
 about death or don't think about death fear death or don't fear death but ithink not many people think about this
 topic deeply rigorously in the way thatnietzsche suggested
 this topic like many that lead to deep personal self-reflection frankly isdangerous for the mind
 as all first principles thinking about the human condition isif you gaze long into the abyss like
 nietzsche said the abyss will gaze back into youi've been recently reading a lot about
 world war ii stalin and hitler it feels to me thatthere's some fundamental truth there to
 be discovered in the moments of history that changedeverything the suffering
 the triumphs if i bring up donald trump or vladimir putin in these conversationsit is never through a political lens i'm
 not left nor right i think for myself deeplyand often question everything changing
 my mind as often as is needed i ask for your patience empathy andrigorous thinking
 if you arrive to this podcast from a place of partisanshipif you hate trump or love trump or any
 other political leader no matter what he orthey do and see everyone who disagrees
 with you as delusional i ask that you unsubscribe and don'tlisten to these conversations
 because my hope is to go beyond that kind of divisive thinkingi think we can only make progress toward
 truth through deep and pathetic thinking and conversationand as always

 sheldon solomon what is the role of death andfear of death and life


0:05:38
Speaker 0 :well from our perspective the uniquely
 human awareness of death and our unwillingness to accept that factwe would argue is the primary
 motivational impetus for almost everything that people dowhether they're aware of it or not so


0:05:59
Speaker 1 :that's kind of been your life work
 your view of the human condition is that death you've written the book warm withthe core that death is at the core of
 our consciousness of everything of how wesee the world of what drives us


0:06:15
Speaker 0 :maybe can you can you


0:06:15
Speaker 1 :elaborate like what how you see
 death fitting in what does it mean to be at the core

0:06:24
Speaker 0 :of our being so i think that's a great
 question and you know to be pedantic i usuallystart you know my psychology classes
 and i say to the students okay you know let's define our terms and the ologypart
 they get right away you know it's the study ofand then we get to the psyche part
 and understandably you know the students are like oh that means mindand i'm like well no that's a modern
 interpretation but in a in ancient greek it means soul but not in thecartesian dualistic sense that most of
 us in the west think when that word comesto mind and so
 you hear the word soul and you're like well all right that's thenon-physical part of me
 that's potentially detachable from my corporal container when i'm no longerhere
 but aristotle's who coined the word psyche i think umhe was uh not a dualist he was a monist
 he thought that the soul was inextricably connected to the bodyand he defined soul as the essence of a
 natural body that is alive and then he goes on and hesays all right
 but let me give you an example if um if anaxe was alive the soul of an axe would
 be to chop and if you can pluck your eyeball out ofyour head
 and it was still functioning then the soul of the eyeball would be tosee
 you know and then he's like all right the soul of a grasshopperis to hop the soul of a woodpecker is to
 peck which raises the question of course whatis the essence
 of what it means to be human and here of course there is no oneuniversally accepted conception of the
 essence of our humanity all right aristotle uh you know gives usthe idea of humans as rational animals
 you know we're homo sapiens butnot the only game in town got joseph
 hoisinger an anthropologist in the 20th century he called us homo ludensthat were basically fundamentally
 playful creatures and i think it was hannah arendt uh homofaber we're tool making creatures
 uh another woman ellen dizzinayake wrote a book called homo aestheticusand following aristotle and his poetics
 she's like well we're not only rational animals we're also aesthetic creaturesthat appreciate
 beauty there's another take on humans i think they call us homo naratanswe're all we're storytelling creatures
 and i i think all of those uh designations of what itmeans to be human
 are quite useful heuristically and certainly worthy of our collectivecogitation
 but what what garnered my attention when i was a young punk was just asingle line
 in an essay by a scottish guy it was alexander smithin in a book called dreamthwarp i think
 it's written in the 1860s he just says right in the middle of anessay it is our knowledge
 that we have to die that makes us human and i remember reading that and i in mygut i was like oh man i don't like that
 but i think you're on to something and then william james the thegreat harvard philosopher and arguably
 the first academic psychologist he referred todeath as the worm at the core of the
 human condition so that's where the worm at the core idea comes inand that's just an illusion to the story
 of genesis back in the proverbial old days in thegarden of eden uh
 everything was going tremendously well until the serpent tempts eve totake a chop out of the apple of the tree
 of knowledge and adam partakes also andthis is according to the bible what
 brings death into the world and from ourvantage point
 the story of genesis is a remarkable allegoricaluh recount of the origin of
 consciousness where we get to the point where by virtueof our vast intelligence we come to
 realize the inevitability of death and souh you know the apple is beautiful and
 it's tasty but when you get right into the middleof it there's that ugly reality which is
 our finitude and then fast forward a bit anduh i was a young professor at skidmore
 college in 1980 um my phd is in experimental social psychology and i imainly did studies
 with clinical psychologists evaluating the efficacy of non-pharmacologicalinterventions to reduce
 stress and that was good work and i found it interesting butin my first week as a professor at
 skidmore i i'm just walking up and down the shelves of the librarysaw some books by a guy i had never
 heard of ernest becker a cultural anthropologist recentlydeceased he died in 1974
 after um weeks before actually he was posthumously uh awardedthe pulitzer prize and non-fiction for
 his book the denial of death

0:12:17
Speaker 1 :and and that was his last book it's


0:12:20
Speaker 0 :actually his next to last
 book i don't know how you pulled this off but he had one more after he diedcalled escape from
 evil and evidently it was supposed to originally the denial of death wassupposed to be this giant
 thousand page book that was both and they split it up and the what becameescape from evil
 uh his wife marie becker finished well be that as it may in it is in thedenial of death
 where becker just says it in the first paragraph i i i believe uh that theterror of death
 and the way that human beings respond to it or decline to respond to it isprimarily responsible for almost
 everything we do whether we're aware of it or not and mostlywe're not and so i read that first
 paragraph lex and i was like wow okay this dude you're on to something

0:13:21
Speaker 1 :you're on to something it's the same


0:13:24
Speaker 0 :thing it's the same thing
 and then it reminded me i think um not to play psychologists but you knowlet's face it
 i believe there's a reason why we end up driftingwhere we ultimately come to so i'm in my
 mid-20s i got ernest becker's book in my handand the next thing i know i'm
 remembering uh when i'm eight years old the day that my grandmother diedand you know the day before my mom
 said oh say goodbye to grandma she's not well and okay so i was like okaygrandma
 and i knew she wasn't well but i didn't really appreciate the magnitudeof her illness well she dies the next
 day and it's in the evening and i'm justsitting there
 looking at my stamp collection and i'm like wow i'm gonnamiss my grandmother and then i'm like no
 wait a minute that means my mother's gonna die andafter she gets old
 and that's even worse after all who's gonna make me dinnerand that bothered me for a while but
 then i'm looking at the stamps all the dead american presidentsand i'm like there's george washington
 he's dead there's thomas jefferson he's dead my mom's gonna be deadoh i'm gonna get old
 and be dead someday and at eight years old that was myfirst explicit existential crisis i
 remember it being you know one of these blood curdlingrealizations that i
 tried my best to ignore for the most of the time i wassubsequently growing up
 but fast forward back to skidmore collegemid-20s you know reading becker's book
 in the 1980s thinking to myselfwow one of the reasons why i'm finding
 this so compelling is that it squares with my own personal experienceand then to make a short story long and
 i'll i'll shut up lex but what what grabbed me about becker andthis is in part
 uh because i read a lot of his other books umthere's another book the birth and death
 of meaning uh which is framed um in from an evolutionaryperspective
 and and then the denial of death is really moreframed from an existential psychodynamic
 vantage point and as a a young um academic uh i wasreally taken by what i found to be
 a very potent juxtaposition that you really don't see that often yetusually evolutionary types
 are eager to dismiss the psychodynamic typesand vice versa and maybe only john bolby
 you know there's there's other folks but the attachment theoristjohn bolby was really one of the first
 serious academics to say these um these waysof thinking about things are quite


0:16:34
Speaker 1 :compatible and can you comment on what's
 what a psychodynamics view of the world is versus an evolutionary view of theworld just in case people are not oh


0:16:41
Speaker 0 :yeah absolutely that's that's a fine
 question well for the evolutionary types umin general are interested
 in um how it is and why it is that wehave adapted to our surroundings in the
 service of persisting over time and being represented in the gene pool

0:17:08
Speaker 1 :thereafter you used to be a fish
 yes we used to be a fish and also yeah and i ended upuh talking on a podcast yeah how we came


0:17:15
Speaker 0 :to be that way how we came to be that
 way and so whereas the existentialpsychodynamic types
 i would say are more interested in development acrossa single lifespan and
 but but the evolutionary types dismiss the psychodynamic types as overlyspeculative
 and devoid of empirical support for their viewswell they um you know they'll just say
 these guys are talking [ __ ] if you'll pardon the expressionand of course uh you can turn right
 around and say the same about the evolutionarytypes that they are often and rightfully
 criticized evolutionary psychologists for what are called the just so storieswhere it's like oh this is probably
 why fill in the blank is potentially adaptive and my thoughtagain early on was i didn't see any
 um intrinsic antithesis between these viewpoints i just foundthem dialectically
 compatible and uh very powerful when

0:18:26
Speaker 1 :combined
 so one question i would ask here is um about a science being speculative youknow we understand so a little about the
 human mind you said you picked up becker's book andyou know it felt like it was onto
 something that's the same thing i felt when i picked up becker's book uhprobably also
 in my early 20s uh you know i read a lot of philosophy but it felt likethe question of the meaning of life kind
 of you know this seemed to be the most uhthe closest to the truth somehow
 it was on to something so i i guess the question that i want to ask also is likehow speculative is psychology how like
 all of your lives work

0:19:11
Speaker 0 :

0:19:12
Speaker 1 :um how do you feel how confident do you
 feel about the whole thing about understanding our mind i feel

0:19:18
Speaker 0 :confidently unconfident to have it


0:19:25
Speaker 1 :both ways like what do we make of
 psychology you want to make starting with freud'syou know starting um just just our
 or even just philosophy uh even uh the aspects of uh the scienceslike uh you know my field of artificial
 intelligence but also physics you know it often feels like man wedon't really understand
 most of what's going on here and certainly that's truewith uh the human mind yeah well to me


0:19:53
Speaker 0 :that's the proper epistemological stance
 i don't know anything well uh it's the socraticuh i know that i don't know which is the
 first step on the path to wisdom i i would argueforcefully that we know a lot more
 than we used to i would argue equally forcefully uh not that i have aphd in the philosophy of science but i i
 believe that the thomas coons of the world are rightwhen they point out that change is not
 necessarily progress and so on the one hand i i do think we knowa lot more
 than we did back in the day when if you wanted to fly you put on some wax wingsand
 jumped off a mountain yeah on the other handi think it's quite arrogant when
 scientists i'll just speak about psychological scientists um whenthey have the audacity to mistake
 statistical precision for knowledge and insightand when they make the mistake in my
 estimation that einstein bemoaned and that's thisidea
 that the mere accumulation of data uh will necessarily result inconceptual breakthroughs and so i i like
 the um well we're all i hope appreciative of the people who trainedus but i remember my first day in
 graduate school at the university of kansasuh they brought us into a room and on
 one side of the board was a quote by kurt lewin or levine famous germanuh social psychologist and there was
 nothing and the quote is there's nothing more useful than a good theoryand then on the other side was another
 quote by german physicist his name eludes meand it was all theories are wrong and
 i'm like uh which is it and of course the pointis that it's both our theories
 are i believe powerful ways to direct our attentionto aspects of human affairs
 that might render us better able to understand ourselves inthe world around us
 now i also as an experimental psychologist i adhere tothe view
 that theories are essentially hypothesis generating devices and that at its bestscience is a dialectical interplay where
 you have theoretical assertions that yield testable hypothesesand that either results in the
 corroboration of the theory the rejection of it or the modificationthereafter if we look at the


0:22:57
Speaker 1 :existentialists
 or even like uh modern philosopher psychology types like jordan petersoni'm not sure if you're familiar with it


0:23:09
Speaker 0 :i know jordan pretty well
 we go way back actually if he were here with us today we wouldhe would be jumping in and i believe
 very interesting and important ways but yeah we go back 30 years agohe was uh basically saying our work


0:23:28
Speaker 1 :is nonsense let's get into this i'm sure
 i'll talk to jordan uh eventually on this thing yeah goingthrough some rough times right now


0:23:35
Speaker 0 :oh absolutely and i and i wish him well
 um jordan was working on his maps ofmeaning
 and we were publishing our work and i i think jordan at the timeum was concerned about
 our vague claims to the effect that all meaning is arbitraryhe takes a more jungian
 as well as evolutionary view that i don't think is wrong by the waywhich is that um there are certain
 kinds of meanings that are more important let's sayreligious types and that we didn't pay
 sufficient attention to that um

0:24:25
Speaker 1 :in our early days so uh can you try to
 uh lose a day like what his world view is because he's also a religious manuh so what uh what was this what was uh
 some of the interesting aspects of the disagreements

0:24:38
Speaker 0 :that then yeah well back in the day i
 just said you know jordan was a young punk uh we were youngpunks he was just kind of flailing in an
 animated way at some conferences saying that

0:24:49
Speaker 1 :um we you're still both kind of punks


0:24:51
Speaker 0 :yeah we are
 kind of punks so i saw him three or four years ago we spoke on ait was an awesome day we were in canada
 at uh the ontario shakespeare festival where we were asked to be on a canadianbroadcast
 system program i think we were talking about macbethfrom a psychodynamic
 perspective and i hadn't seen him in a ton of years and we spent two daystogether
 had a great time you know we had just written our bookuh the worm at the core and he's like
 you know you you you're missing a big opportunity everytime you say something
 you have to have your phone yeah and you have to film yourselfand then you have to put it on youtube


0:25:32
Speaker 1 :yeah uh he was onto something that uh
 you know that just as a small tangent yeah uh it'sit's almost sad to look at jordan
 peterson somebody like yourself after having done this podcast i'verealized that there is
 really brilliant people in this world and oftentimesespecially like when they're um
 i mean it would love are a little bit like punks that's rightthey they kind of do their own thing and
 like the world doesn't know they exist as much as they shouldand it's so interesting because most
 people are kind of boringand then the interesting ones kind of go
 on their own and there's not a smartphonethat's that's so interesting he was on
 to something that um i mean it's interesting that he i don'tthink he was thinking from a money
 perspective but he was probably thinking of likeconnecting with people or sharing his
 knowledge but uh people don't often think that waythat's right so
 maybe we can try to get back to you're both brilliantpeople and i'd love to get some
 interesting disagreements earlier and later about in yourpsychological work in your world views


0:26:43
Speaker 0 :well our disagreements
 today would be uh along two dimensions uh one is he isand again i wish he was here to correct
 me yes um when i say that he ismore committed to
 the virtues of the judeo-christian traditionparticularly christianity and in a sense
 is a contemporary kierkegaard of sorts whenhe's saying there's only one
 way to leap into faith and i would take ardent issue with thatclaim on the grounds that that is
 one but by no means not the only way uh tofind meaning and value in life and so
 and i see his what's his warm at the

0:27:38
Speaker 1 :core
 what is like uh so we're talking about a little bit of a higher level ofdiscovering meaning yeah what's his uh
 what does he make of death oh i don't

0:27:48
Speaker 0 :know and this is
 where it would be nice to uh have him herehe has you know from a distance
 criticized our work as misguided having said that though when we were togetherhe said something along the lines that
 there is no theoretical body of work in academicpsychology
 right now for which there is more empirical evidenceand so i i appreciated that he's a great
 uh researcher he's a good clinician theother thing that we will agree
 to disagree about uh rather vociferously is ultimately politicalslash economic so i remember being at
 dinner with him telling him that the next book that iwanted to write
 was going to be called why left and right or both beside the pointand my argument was going to be and it
 is going to be that both liberal and political liberal and conservativepolitical philosophy
 are each intellectually and morally bankrupt because they'reboth framed in terms of assumptions
 about human nature that are demonstrably falseand jordan didn't mind me uh knocking
 liberal political philosophy on those grounds that would basically be likestephen pinker's
 blank slate but he took issue when i pointed out thatactually it's conservative political
 philosophy which starts with john locke'sassumption that in a state of nature
 there are no societies just autonomous individuals whoare striving for survival
 that's one of the most obviously patently wrong assertions in the historyof intellectual thought and locke uses
 that to justify his claims about the individual right toacquire
 unlimited amounts of property which is ultimatelyuh the justification for neo-liberal
 economics and can you look around a

0:30:06
Speaker 1 :little bit
 uh what's the uh can you describe his philosophy againas view of the world sure and what uh
 uh neoliberal economics is yeah let me

0:30:17
Speaker 0 :translate it in english so basically all
 all these days anybody who says i'm a i i'm a conservative free-market typeyou're following john locke and adam
 smith whether you're aware of it or not sohere's john locke
 who by the way all of these guys are great sofor me to appear to criticize any of
 these folks it is with the highest regardand also we need to understand in my
 estimation how important their ideas are lock isworking in a time
 where all rule was top down by divine right and he's trying desperatelyto come up
 with a philosophical justification to shift power and autonomyto individuals and
 he starts in his second treatise on government 1690 or sohe he just he says okay let's start with
 a state of nature and he's like in a state of naturethere's no societies
 there's just individuals and in a perfect universe there wouldn't beany societies
 there would just be individuals who by the law of nature have a right tosurvive
 and uh in the service of survival they have the right to acquire andpreserve
 the fruits of their own labor uh um but his point is and it's actually agood one you know he's following hobbs
 here he's like well the problem with that isthat people are [ __ ]
 and um if they would let each other alonethen we would still be living in a state
 of nature everybody just doing what they did to get by eachday
 but it's a whole lot easier you know if i see like anapple tree a mile away well i can go
 over and pick an apple but if you're 10 meters away withan apple in your hand it's a lot easier
 if i pick up a rock and crack your head andtake the apple
 and his point was that the problem is that people can't becounted on to behave
 they will they will take each other's propertymoreover he argued
 if someone takes your property you have the rightto you have the right to retribution
 in proportion to the degree of the magnitude of the transgressionenglish translation if i take your apple
 you have the right to take an apple back you don't have the right to kill myfirstborn
 but people being people they're apt to escalate retaliatory behavior thuscreating
 what law called a state of war so he saidin order to avoid a state of war people
 reluctantly give up their freedom in exchange for securitythey agree to obey the law and that the
 sole function of government is to keep domestic tranquility and toward off foreign evasion
 in order to protect our right to propertyall right so now here's the okay
 property thing all right so uh lock saysif you look in the bible and in nature
 there is no private property umbut lock says well surely
 you if there's anything that you own it's your bodyand surely you have a right by nature
 to stay alive and then by extension anything that you do where you exerteffort or labor that becomes your
 private property so back to the apple tree if i walk overto an apple tree
 that's everybody's apples until i pick oneand the minute i do that is my apple
 right and then he says you can have as many apples as you wantas long as you don't waste them and as
 long as you don't impinge on somebody else's rightto get apples right so far so good yep
 and then he says well okayin the early days you you could only eat
 so many apples and or you could only trade so many apples with somebody elseso he was like well if you put a fence
 around a bunch of apple trees those become yourapples that's your
 property if somebody else wants to put a fence around nebraskathat's their property
 and everybody can have as much property as they wantbecause the world is so big
 that there is no limit to what you can haveif you pursue it by virtue of your own
 effort but then he says money came into thepicture
 and this is important because it's a he noticedlong before anybody before the freud's
 of the world that money is funky because it has nointrinsic value
 he's like ooh look at that shiny piece of metalthat actually has if you're hungry
 and you have a choice between a carrot and a lump of gold in the desert mostpeople are going to go for the carrot
 but his point is is that uh the allure of moneyis that it's basically a concentrated
 symbol of wealth but because it doesn't spoillocke said you're entitled to have as
 much money as you're able to garner rightthen he says well the reality is
 is that some people are more the word that he used was industrioushe said some people more industrious
 than others all right today we would say smarterless lazy
 more ambitious he just said that's natural it's also truetherefore he argued uh over time
 some people are gonna have a whole lot of propertyand other people not much at all
 inequality for luck is natural and beneficialfor everyone his argument was that you
 know the rising tide lifts all boats and that the truly creative andinnovative
 are entitled to relatively unlimited worth because we're all better offas a result so the point very
 simply is that well that's basically and then you have adam smith the you knowin the next century with the invisible
 hand where adam smith says everyone pursuing their own selfishthat's not
 necessarily pejorative if everyone pursues their ownselfish interests we will all be better
 off as a result and what do you think is

0:37:44
Speaker 1 :the flawed in that way


0:37:47
Speaker 0 :well there's two flaws one is is that um
 well one flaw is first of all that that it is based on anerroneous assumption to begin with which
 is that there never was a time in human history when we were in a social

0:38:04
Speaker 1 :species in a sense you don't feel like
 that where there's uh this emphasis of uh individual autonomyis a flawed premise like where there's a
 there's something fundamentally deeply uh interconnected

0:38:18
Speaker 0 :between us i do
 i think that plato and socrates uh you know in the crito were closer to thetruth
 uh when they started with the assumption that we wereinterdependent and they derived
 individual autonomy as a manifestation of afunctional
 social system that's fascinating so when margaret thatcheryou're too young uh you know in the
 1980s she said societies there's no such thing as societiesthere's just
 individuals pursuing their self-interest so uh so that's one point where i wouldtake issue respectfully with john locke
 point number two is when locke says in 1690 wellengland's filled up um
 so if you want some land just go to america it's emptyor maybe there's a few savages there
 just kill them so and and melville does the same thingin moby dick where he
 he thinks about will there ever come a time where we run out of whalesand he says no but we have run out of
 whales and so locke was right maybein 1690 that the world was large
 and had infinite resources he's certainlywronged today in in my opinion
 also wrong is the claim uh that the unlimited pursuit of personalwealth does not harm those around us
 there is no doubt uh that radical inequality is tragicpsychologically and physically it's
 poverty is not that terrible it's easy for me to say because i have a place tostay and something to eat
 but as long as you're not starving and have a place to be poverty's not aschallenging as being having the
 impoverished and close proximity to those who are obscenelywealthy


0:40:22
Speaker 1 :so it's not the any absolute measure of
 your well-being it's the inequality of that well-beingis quite frantically painful um so maybe
 just to uh link on the jordan peterson thingin terms of your uh disagreement on his
 worldview so he went through quite a bit it you know there'sbeen quite a bit of fire right in
 in his defense or maybe his opposition of the idea of equality of outcomesso looking at the inequality that's in
 our world looking at you know certain groupsmeasurably having an outcome that's
 different than other groups and then drawing conclusions aboutfundamental
 uh unfairness injustice inequality in the system so likesystematic racism systematic sexism
 systematic anything else that creates inequalityand he's been kind of uh saying pretty
 simple things uh to say that uh you know the systemfor the most part
 is not broken or flawed yeah that the inequalities part the um theinequality of outcomes as part of our
 world what we should strive for is the uh youknow equality of opportunity yeah and i


0:41:39
Speaker 0 :i
 do not dispute that as an abstraction but again to back up for a second i i dotake issue with jordan's
 uh fervent devotion to the free market and his cavalier dismissal ofmarxist ideas which he has uh
 in my estimation uh mischaracterized in his public depictions let's get into

0:42:06
Speaker 1 :it so he he just seems to
 really not like um uh socialism marxism communismyeah uh historically speaking sort of
 uh i mean how would i characterize it i'm not exactly surei don't want to again he's yeah he'll
 eventually be here to defend himself john locke unfortunately not here todefend exactly
 but what's what's your sense uh about marxism and and uh theuh the way jordan talks about the way
 you think about it from the economics from thephilosophical perspective yeah well like


0:42:39
Speaker 0 :if we were all here together i'd say we
 need to start with marx's economic and philosophicalmanuscripts of 1844
 before marx became more of a polemicist and i would argue that marx'spolitical philosophy he's a crappy
 economist i don't dispute that but his arguments abouthuman nature
 his arguments about the inevitably catastrophicpsychological and environmental
 and economic effects of capitalism i would argueevery one of those has proven quite
 right marx maybe did not have the answerbut he saw in the
 18 whenever he was writing um that inevitably capitalismum would lead to massive inequity
 that it was ultimately based on uh the need to denigrateand dehumanize labor to render them in
 his language a fleshy cog in a giant machine and thatit would create a tension and conflict
 between those who own things and those who made thingsthat over time would always you know the
 thomas pickerty guy who writes about capitaland just makes the point that return on
 investment will always be greater than wages that means the people withmoney are going to have a lot more
 that means there's going to come a point where the economic house of cardsfalls apart now the joseph shumpters of
 the world they're like that's creative destructionbring it that's great so i think it's
 niles ferguson he was he's a historian he may be atstanford now he was at harvard
 you know he writes about the history of money and he's likeyeah there's been 20 or whatever
 depressions and big recessions uh in the last several hundred years andwhen that happens half of the population
 or whatever is catastrophicallyinconvenienced
 but that's the price that we pay for progress other people would argueand i
 would agree with them that i will happily sacrificethe rate of progress in order to flatten
 the curve of economic destruction to put that inplainer english um i
 would um direct our attention to the social democracies thatforgetting for the moment of whether
 it's possible to do this on a scale in a country asbig
 as ours on all of the things that really matter you know gross domesticgdp
 or whatever that's just an abstraction but when you look atwhatever the united nations says how we
 measure quality of life uh you know lifeexpectancy
 education you know rates of alcoholism suicideand so on the countries that do better
 are the mixed economies they're market economiesthat have high tax rates in exchange
 for the provision of services that come as a right for citizens yeah so i

0:46:17
Speaker 1 :mean i guess the question is
 you've kind of mentioned that uh you know like as marx described a capitalismwith a slippery slope eventually things
 go awry in some kind of way so that's the question is when you have when youimplement a system yeah how does it go
 wrong eventually you know the you know eventually we'll

0:46:39
Speaker 0 :all be dead that's exactly right
 no no no that's right so

0:46:44
Speaker 1 :and then the criticism i mean i think
 these days uh unfortunately marxism as likeis a dirty word i i say unfortunately
 because even if you disagree with the philosophy it shouldyou should
 uh like calling somebody a marxist yeah should not be a thing that uh shuts downall conversation


0:47:04
Speaker 0 :no that's right and and the fact is i'm
 sympathetic with uh jordan's dismissal of the folksand
 popular the talking heads these days who spewmarxist words um
 to me it's like fashionable nonsense do you know that book that the physicistwrote
 mocking uh you're too young so in the uh 20 or so years we're all pretty youngreally yeah that's right but they're i
 think they're with these nyu physicists they wrote a paper just mocking the uhkind of literary uh post-modern types
 you know yes oh those kinds of yeah yeah

0:47:40
Speaker 1 :

0:47:41
Speaker 0 :it was just nonsense and of course it
 was made the lead article um and and you know my poor is marxwouldn't be a marxist


0:47:51
Speaker 1 :true i've read and listened to some of
 the work of uh richard wolff he speaks prettyeloquently about marxism i like him
 uh he's uh one of the only uh you know one of the only people speakingabout a lot about marxism and the way we
 are now in in a serious way in it in a sort ofsaying you know uh what are the flaws of
 capitalism not saying like yeah basically soundingvery different and people should check
 out his work no i it's all this kind of work thiskind of
 outrage mob culture of uh sort of demanding equalityequality of outcome


0:48:31
Speaker 0 :that's not marxism it is not marxism he
 he didn't say that you know he literally said eachwhat was it like each according to their
 needs and each according to their abilities or something like that

0:48:42
Speaker 1 :so the question is the implementation
 like absolutely humans are messy so how does it go wrong

0:48:48
Speaker 0 :like it just met there you go brilliant
 it's messy and this gets back to my rantabout
 the book that i want to try if i don't stroke out why left and rightare both beside the point you know the
 the people conservatives areright when they condemn liberals
 for being simple-minded by assuming that a modification of external conditionswill yield
 changes in human nature you know you know again that's where marx andskinner are
 odd bedfellows you know here they are just saying ohlet's change the surroundings and
 things will inevitably get better on the other handwhen um conservatives
 say that people are innately selfish and they use that as thejustification for glorifying
 the unbridled pursuit of wealth well they're only half rightbecause it turns out that we can be
 innately selfish but we are also innately generousand reciprocating creatures there's
 remarkable studies i think they've been done at yaleof you know babies 14 month old babies
 um if someone hands them a toy and then wants something in returnbabies before they can walk and talk
 will reciprocate all right fine ifsomeone if they want a toy let's say or
 a bottle of water baby wants a bottle of water andi look like i'm trying to give it to the
 baby but i dropped the bottle so the babydoesn't get what she or he wanted
 when given a chance to reciprocate little babies will reciprocatebecause they're aware of and are
 responding to intention similarly if they see somebodyum behaving unfairly to to someone
 they will not help that person in return so so my point is is yeah we areselfish creatures at times
 but we are also simultaneously uber social creatures who areeager to reciprocate and in fact we're
 congenitally prepared to be reciprocators to the point whereuh we will reciprocate on the basis of
 intentions above and beyond what actually happened

0:51:32
Speaker 1 :how so
 i mean your work is on the fundamental role of the fear of mortality yeahin ourselves how fundamental is this
 reciprocation this human connection to other

0:51:46
Speaker 0 :humans well i think it's really innate
 yeah i think it's because yeah bats reciprocate uh not byintention but
 uh you know this i'm going here from richard dawkinsuh the selfish gene you know to
 i love the early dawkins i'm less enamoredlike the early beat yeah no no again i
 say this with great respect but uh you knowdawkins
 just points out that uh you know reciprocation isjust fundamental cooperation is
 fundamental you know it is the it's a one-sided viewof evolutionary takes on thanks when we
 see it solely in terms of individual competition

0:52:32
Speaker 1 :it's it's almost from a game theoretic
 perspective too it's just easier to see the world that wayit's it's easier to i don't know i i
 mean you see this in physics uh there's a whole field of folks likecomplexity yeah
 that kind of embrace the fact that it's all an intricately connected messand it's just very difficult to do
 anything uh with that kind of science but it seems to be much closer toactually representing what the world is


0:52:58
Speaker 0 :like
 so like you put it earlier lex it's messy

0:53:02
Speaker 1 :so yeah left and right you mentioned
 you're thinking of maybe actually puttingit down on paper or something yeah i


0:53:07
Speaker 0 :would like to because what i would
 what i would like to point out again in admiration of all the people that i willthen
 try and have the gall to criticize this look these are all geniusesum lock genius adam smith
 genius when he uses the notion that we're barteringcreatures so he uses that reciprocation
 idea as the basis of his way of thinking

0:53:35
Speaker 1 :about things but that's not at the core
 the murdering is not at the core of human nature it's not a well

0:53:39
Speaker 0 :he says it is he says we're
 fundamentally bartering creatures

0:53:43
Speaker 1 :well that doesn't even make sense then
 because then what how how can we then be autonomousindividuals


0:53:49
Speaker 0 :well because we're going to barter with
 an eye on on on for self

0:53:53
Speaker 1 :

0:53:55
Speaker 0 :for ourselves self yeah but all right so
 but back to adam smith for a second lex is like adam smith here's he's got theinvisible hand
 and my conservative friends i'm like you need to readhis books because he is a big fan
 of the free market and this is my other uh gripe with folks who supportjust unbridled markets adam smith
 understood that there was a role for government for two reasonsone is is that just like locke people
 are not going to behave with integrity and he understood that one role ofgovernment
 is to maintain a proverbial you know even playing field andthen the other thing smith said was that
 there's some things that can't be done well for a profitand i believe he talked about education
 and public health and infrastructure as things that arebest done by governments
 uh because you can't you can make a profit but that doesn't mean that theinstitutions themselves will be
 maximally beneficial yeah so i i would uh i'm just eagerto engage people by saying
 let's start with our most contemporary understandingof human nature which is
 that we are both selfish and tend to cooperate andwe also can be heroically
 helpful to folks in our own tribe andof course how you define one's tribe
 becomes critically important but what some people sayis look we let what would then be
 what kind of political institutions and what kind of economic organizationcan we think about to kind of hit that
 sweet spot and that that would be in my opinion uhhow do we maximize individual autonomy
 in a way that fosters uh creativity and innovation and theself-regard that comes from
 creative expression while engaging our more cooperativeand reciprocal tendencies
 in order to come up with a system that is potentially stable over time becausethe other thing about
 all capital-based systems is the

0:56:38
Speaker 1 :stability
 is it fundamentally and unstable yeah

0:56:41
Speaker 0 :because it's based on infinite growth
 and you know it's a positive feedback loop uh to be silly infinite growth isonly good for
 malignant cancer cells and compound interestotherwise uh you know we want to seek a
 steady state and um that would be you know so whenstephen pinker writes for example again
 great scholar but i'm gonna disagree when he says the worldhas never been better and all we need to
 do is keep making stuff and buying stuff

0:57:14
Speaker 1 :so your sense is the world
 sort of in disagreement with stephen pinker that the world isum like facing a potential catastrophic
 collapse in multiple directions yes and the fact that there are certainlike the
 the rate of violence and aggregate is decreasing thedeath you know the quality of life all
 those kinds of measures that you can plot across centuries that it'simproving that doesn't capture the fact
 that our world might be this we might destroy ourselves in verypainful ways
 uh in the in the in the next century so

0:57:51
Speaker 0 :i'm with jared diamond
 you know in the book collapse where he points outstudying um the collapse of major
 civilizations that it often happens right after things appearto never have been better
 and in that regard i mean there are more uh known voices that have taken issueuh with uh dr pinker i'm thinking of
 john gray who's a british philosopher andhere in the states i don't know where he
 is these days but robert j lifton the psycho historian yeah they'reboth
 of my view and which i hope is by the way wrong uh me too yeah nobut you know between um
 you know ongoing ethnic tensions environmental degradation economicinstability
 and the fact that you know the world has become a petri dish of psychopathology

0:58:53
Speaker 1 :like what what really worries me is the
 the quiet economic pain that people are going through thebusinesses that are closed your dreams
 that are broken because you can no longer do the thing thatyou've wanted to do and how
 i mentioned to you off camera that i've been reading uhthe the rise and fall of the third reich
 and i mean the amountof anger and hatred
 and on the flip side of that sort of nationalist pride that can arise fromdeep economic pain like what happens
 with economic pain is you become bitter yeahyou start to find
 the other whether it's other european nations that mistreated youwhether it's other groups that
 mistreated you it always ends up being the jewsuh somehow somehow our fault here yep
 that's what worries me is where this quiet anger and pain goesin 2021 2022 2030.
 if you look no sorry i'm sorry to see

0:59:58
Speaker 0 :the parallels no no no


0:59:59
Speaker 1 :rise and fall the third reich but you
 know what happens 10 15 years from now from what's because ofthe coved
 pandemic yeah that's happening now and

1:00:08
Speaker 0 :lex you make a
 i think a really profoundly important point you know back to our work fora bitter ernest becker rather you know
 his point is is that the way that we manageexistential terror
 is to embrace culturally constructed beliefsystems that give us a sense that life
 has meaning that we have value and in the form of self-esteem which weget from perceiving that we meet or
 exceed the expectations associated with the role that weplay in society well here we are right
 now in a world where first of all if youhave nothing you are nothing
 and secondly as you were saying before we got started todaya lot of jobs are gone and they're not
 coming back

1:01:00
Speaker 1 :and that's the where the self-esteem


1:01:02
Speaker 0 :that's where the self-esteem and
 identity come in where people it's not only that youdon't have anything to eat
 you don't even have a self anymore to speak ofbecause the we typically define
 ourselves you know as marx put it you are what you doand now who are you when
 your way of life as well as your way of earning a living is no longer available

1:01:27
Speaker 1 :yeah and it feels like that uh yearning
 for self-esteem that we could talk a little bit more because sureyou about defining self-esteem is
 quite interesting the more i've read so warm with the core and justin general you're thinking
 it made me realize i haven't thought enough about the idea of self-esteem butthe thing i want to say is uh it feels
 like when you lose your job then it's easy to find it'sit's tempting to find that self-esteem
 in a tribe that's not somehow often positivethat's exactly it's like a tribe that
 defines itself on the hatred of somebody

1:02:09
Speaker 0 :else so that's brilliant and
 and this is what john gray the philosopherin the 1990s he predicted what's
 happening today he wrote a book about globalism andactually hannah arendt
 in the 1950s said the same thing in her book about totalitarianismwhen she said that you know that
 economics has reached the point where most money is made not by actuallymaking stuff
 you know you use money to make money and that uh thereforewhat happens is money chases money
 across national boundaries ultimately governments becomesubordinate
 to the corporate entities whose sole function is to generate moneyand what john gray said is that that
 will inevitably produce economic upheaval inlocal areas which
 will not be attributed to the economic order it will bemisattributed
 to who whoever the scapegoat du jour is and the anger whatand the distress associated with that
 uncertainty uh will be picked up on by ideological demagogues who willtransform that
 into rage so both hannah aren't as well as john graythey they just said uh watch out
 we're gonna have right-wingish populist movements uh where demagogueswho are the alchemists of hate what
 makes them brilliant is they don't they don't the hate'salready there
 but they take the fears and they expertly redirect them to who it is thati need to hate and kill in order to feel
 good about myself so back to your point lex that's rightso the self-regard that used to come
 from having a job and doing it well and as a result of that having adequateresources to provide a decent life for
 your family well those opportunities are goneand yeah what's left so max weber
 german sociologist at the beginning of the 20th centuryum he said in times of historical
 upheaval um we are apt to embrace he was the onewho coined the term charismatic leader
 right seemingly larger than life individualswho often believe or their followers
 believe are divinely ordained to rid the world of evilyeah all right now ernest becker he used
 weber's ideas in order to account for the rise of hitler hitler waselected
 and he was elected when germans were an extraordinarystate of existential distress
 and he said i'm going to make germany great again all right now what beckeradds
 to the equation is his claim that what underlies our affection forcharismatic populist leaders good and
 bad is death anxiety all right now here'swhere we come in
 where egghead experimental researchers you know becker wrote thisbook the denial of death and he couldn't
 get a job people just dismissed these ideas asfanciful speculation
 for which there's no evidence and

1:06:02
Speaker 1 :and you've done some good experiments


1:06:04
Speaker 0 :yeah and here's where
 here's where i can be more cavalier and where what i would urgepeople i like what you said lex is
 ignore my histrionic and polemic languageif possible and step back
 if you can myself included and let's just considerthe the research findings because
 uh in september 11 2001 people that are old enough to rememberthat
 horrible day two days before um george w bush had the lowest approvalrating in the history of presidential
 polling right three weeks later after he said wewill rid the world of the evildoers
 and then a week or two after that he said in a cover story on time magazinethat he believed that god had chosen him
 to lead the world during this to lead the country rather during thisperilous time
 he had the highest approval rating and sowe're like well what happened you know
 is what happened to americans that their approval ofpresident bush
 got so high so fast well our view following becker is that 2001 was like agiant death reminder yeah the people
 dying plus the symbols of american greatnessworld trade center
 and and the the pentagon so we did a bunch of experiments and most of ourexperiments are disarmingly simple we
 have one group of people and we just remind them that they'regoing to die we say hey write
 your thoughts and feelings about dying or in other cases we stopthem outside either in front of a
 funeral home or a hundred meters to either side ourthought being that if we stop you in
 front of a funeral home then death is on your mindeven if you don't know it
 and then there's other studies that are even more subtle where we bring peopleinto the lab
 and they read stuff on a computer and while they're doing that we flashthe word death
 for 28 milliseconds it's so fast you don't see anythingand then we just measure people's
 reactions or behavior thereafter so what we foundin 2003
 leading up to the election of 2004 was that americans did not care forpresident
 bush or his policies in iraq in controlled conditions but if wereminded them of their
 mortality first they like bush a lot moreso in every study that we did americans
 like john kerry who was running against bushthey like carrie more than bush


1:08:51
Speaker 1 :

1:08:53
Speaker 0 :in a control condition yeah and but if
 if they were reminded of death first then they like bush a lot more

1:09:02
Speaker 1 :so by the way just a small pause you
 said they're disseminally simple experimentsi think that's um and people should read
 uh warm at the core for some otherdescriptions you have a lot of
 different experiences of this nature i think it's a brilliantexperiment um connected to the stoics
 perhaps of uh how your world view on anythingand how delicious that water tastes
 yes after you're reminded of your own mortality it's such a fascinatingexperiment
 that you could probably keep doing like millions of themto uh draw insight about
 the way we see the world no that's right

1:09:39
Speaker 0 :lex and i appreciate the
 compliment not because we did anything but because what these studies many ofwhich are now done
 by other people around the world in labs that we're not connected with what i'mmost proud about our work i am proud of
 the experiments that we've done but it's notscience until
 somebody else can replicate your findings and independent researchersare interested in in pursuing them i


1:10:08
Speaker 1 :it's such a fascinating idea i don't
 have to think about a lot about the experiments you've doneand that you've inspired about the fact
 that death changes the way you see a bunch of different things uh the ithink the stoics
 talked about the uh i mean in general just memento mori likejust thinking about death and meditating
 on death is a really positive not a positiveit's an enlightening way
 to uh live life so what do you think about thatat the uh and the individual level like
 what is the role about being bringing that terror of death fearof death to the surface
 and being cognizant of it for us that's

1:10:53
Speaker 0 :the
 that's the ball game um so what we write in our book and here we'rejust
 um paying homage to the philosophers and theologians that come before us is topoint out that literally
 since antiquity um there has been a consensus thatto lead a full life requires
 um albert camus said come to terms with deaththereafter anything is possible
 and so you've got the the stoics and you got theepicureans and then you got the tibetan
 book of the dead and then you got like the medievalmonks that
 you know worked with like a skull uh on their deskand the whole idea i should back up a
 bit because and just remind folks that our studies you know when we remindpeople that they're going to die
 and we find that yeah they drink more water if a famous personum is is you know advertising it
 uh they eat more cookies they want more fancy clothes they sit closerto people that look like them
 it changes who they vote for but all of those thingsthose are very subtle death reminders
 you don't even know that death is on your mindand so our point is is that and this is
 kind of counterintuitive and that is thatthe most problematic and unsavory
 human reactions to death anxiety are malignant manifestations ofrepressed
 death anxiety you know we try and bury it under the psychological bushes andthen it comes back to bear bitter fruit
 but what the theologians and the philosophers of the worldare saying is it behooves each of us
 to spend considerable time you don't have to be a gothdeath rocker you know wallowing in death
 imagery to spend enough timeentertaining the reality of the human
 condition which is that you too will pass to get to the pointwell where there is
 to lapse into a cliche the capacity for personal transformationand growth let's go personal for a


1:13:35
Speaker 1 :second
 uh are you yourself

1:13:42
Speaker 0 :afraid of death yeah um


1:13:44
Speaker 1 :i mean and how much do you meditate on
 that thought like uh maybe your own study of itis a kind of escape from your own
 mortality absolutely lex

1:13:54
Speaker 0 :so you got it and like if you figure out


1:13:57
Speaker 1 :death somehow you won't die


1:13:59
Speaker 0 :so no no uh so my my colleagues and
 good friends jeff greenberg and tom pozinski you know we met in graduateschool in the 1970s we've been doing
 this work for 40 years and we cheerfully admiteven though it doesn't reflect well
 on us as humans that i should just speak for myself buti i feel like there's a real sense in
 which doing these studies and writing booksand and
 lecturing has been my way of avoiding directly confronting myanxieties by
 turning it into an intellectual exercise and um and every once in a whiletherefore when i think that i'm making
 some progress as a human i have to remind myself that uhthat is probably not the case
 um and that i have at times like all humansbeen more preoccupied with the
 implications of these ideas for my self-esteemuh it's like oh we're going to write a
 book and maybe we'll get to go on tv or somethingwell no that's not the same as
 to actually think about it in a way that you feel it rather thanjust think it yeah no you did when you


1:15:23
Speaker 1 :were eight


1:15:26
Speaker 0 :that's exactly right so when i first
 read the denial of death i i was so literally flabbergasted by itthat i took a leave of absence for a
 year and just like did what would beconsidered menial jobs i i did
 construction work i worked in a restaurant andi i was just like wait a minute
 if if i if i understand what this guy is sayingthen i'm just a culturally constructed
 meat puppet doing things for reasons that iknow
 not yeah in order to assuage death anxietyand that's like that that that's not
 acceptable

1:16:11
Speaker 1 :maybe another interesting person to talk
 about is ernest becker himself sure so how did heface his death is there
 something interesting personal i think

1:16:25
Speaker 0 :so
 so interesting to me is becker also from a jewish familyclaimed to be atheistic
 did not identify ultimately as jewish i believe he convertedto christianity but was himself
 a religious person and he said he became religiouswhen his first child was born now


1:16:56
Speaker 1 :religious
 what does that mean does he have a faith and well let's talk more mostimportantly is the afterlife
 he was his view on the afterlife he was

1:17:06
Speaker 0 :uh agnostic
 on that but he did um now the denial of deathis um there's a chapter
 devoted to kierkegaard and he talks about for kierkegaardum if you want to become a mature
 individual you know if you want to learn something you go tothe university if you want to become a
 more mature individual according tokierkegaard you got to go to the unit
 you got to go to the school of anxiety and what kierkegaard said is that wehave to let this
 vague dis ease put a hyphen between dis and ease about death kierkegaard's pointis
 you have to really think about that you have to think aboutit and feel it you got to
 let it seek in or seep into your mind at which pointaccording to kierkegaard basically
 you realize that your present identity is fundamentally a culturalconstruction
 you didn't choose the time and place of your birth you didn't choose your nameuh you know you didn't choose
 necessarily even the social role that you occupy youmight have chosen
 from what's available in your culture but not from the full paletteof human opportunities and so what
 kierkegaard said is that we need to realize thatwe've been living a lie of sorts
 becker calls it a necessary lie and and we have to momentarilydispose of that and so now kierkegaard
 says well here i am i i have shrugged offall of the cultural accoutrements that i
 have used uh to define myselfand now what am i or who am i this is
 like the ancient greek tragedy where the worst thing was to beno one or no thing
 all right at this point kierkegaard said you're really dangling on the precipiceof oblivion and some people tumble into
 that abyss and never come out on the other handkierkegaard said that what you can now
 do metaphorically and literally is to rebuild yourself from the ground upand there's a in the new testament
 there's something you have to die in order to be rebornand kierkegaard's view though is that
 there's only one way to do that this is his proverbialleap into faith and in kierkegaard's
 case it was faith and christianity that you can't have unbridled faith andcultural constructions
 the only thing that you can have unequivocalfaith in is some kind of transcendent
 power all right but of course this raises the question of well is thatjust another death-denying belief system
 right and at the end of the denial of deathbecker admits that there's no way to
 tell while still advocating for what isultimately a religious stance
 now one of the things that i don't understand and ibecker has been the the most singularly
 potent influence in my academic and personal life but ayear or two ago
 i i started reading uh martin heidegger i'm reading being in time andwhat i now wonder is why
 um why becker who refers to heidegger from time to time in his workwhy he didn't take heidegger more
 seriously because heidegger has this is like a secular kierkegaardhe's he has the same thing which is
 death anxiety oh and i should have pointed out thatwhat kierkegaard says is that
 death anxiety most people don't go to the school of anxietythey flee from death anxiety
 by embracing their cultural beliefs kierkegaard says they then tranquilizethemselves with the trivial
 and i love that phrase it's a beautiful phrase because at the end of the denialof death backers like look the average
 american is either drinking or shopping orwatching television and
 they're all the same thing right heidegger says the same thinghe says look and he acknowledges
 kierkegaard he says what makes us feel unsettledand evidently that's an english
 translation of angst that that it's we don't feel at homein the world heidegger says that's
 death anxiety and one direction is the the kierkegaard one he heideggercalls it a flight from death
 you just unself reflexively cling to your cultural constructionsand heidegger borrows the term
 tranquilized but he points out that he doesn't care for that term becausetranquilized
 sounds like you're subdued when in fact what mostculturally constructed meat puppets do
 is to be frenetically engaged with theirsurroundings to ensure that they never
 sit still long enough to actually think about anythingconsequential
 heidegger says there's another way though he's like yowhat you can do is to come to terms with
 that death anxiety in the following way thing number oneis to realize that not only
 are you going to die but your death can happenat any given moment so for heidegger if
 you say i know i'm going to die in some vaguely unspecified future momentthat's still death denial because you're
 saying yeah not me not now yeah heidegger's point isyou need to get to the point where
 you need to realize that uh you know i need to realizethat i can walk outside and
 get smote by a comet or i can stop for gas on the way home andcatch the virus and be dead in two days
 there were any number of potentially unanticipated anduncontrollable fatal outcomes but


1:23:53
Speaker 1 :by the way sorry uh uh to bring into the
 now

1:23:59
Speaker 0 :yeah it is brilliant i agree lex and
 this is why i'm i'm i'm wondering why didn't becker noticethis because that's the being
 and time thing is it's got to be now right and then he says so okay so nowi've dealt
 somewhat uh with the the death part and now he saysnow you've got to deal with what he
 calls existential guilt and he says well all right what you haveto
 you have to realize that like it or not you have to make choicesyou know this is jean-paul sartre we are
 condemned by virtue of consciousness to choosing but heidegger is a littlebit more precise he's like
 look as i was saying earlier you're in reality you're aninsignificant speck of respiring
 carbon-based dust borne into a time and place not of yourchoosing when you're here for a
 microscopic amount of time after which you are notand for heidegger
 you have to realize that like i said i didn't choose to be born amale
 or jewish or in america the offspring of working class peopleand heidegger what he says is yeah
 but you still have to make choices and acceptresponsibility for those choices
 even though you didn't choose any of the parameters that ultimatelylimit what's available to you and
 moreover you're going to not always make good choices so now you're you're guiltyfor your choices and then
 he uses the the poet uh rilka he has a phrase becker uses it in thedenial of death
 the guilt of unlived life i just love that you have to acceptthat you have already diminished
 and in many ways amputated your own possibilitiesby virtue of choices that you've made or
 just as often have declined to make uh because you are reluctant to acceptresponsibility
 for uh for the opportunities that you are now able to create by virtueof seeing the possibilities that lay
 before you so anyway heidegger then says look okayso uh you know i'm a professor
 and i live in america in the 21st centurywell if i was in the third century
 living in a year in mongolia i'm not going to have anopportunity
 to be a professor but what he submits is that there is someaspects of whatever i am
 that are independent of my cultural and historical circumstancesin other words there is a me of sorts
 heidegger would take vigorous issues so would heidegger scholars because i'mnot claiming to understand him this is
 my classic comic book rendering but heidegger's point is that you get tothe point where you're able to
 say okay i am a contingent historicaland cultural artifact
 but so what you know if i was you know now if i was transported athousand years in the past
 in asia i'd be in the same situation i would still be conditionedby time and place i would still have
 choices that i could make within the confines of whatopportunities
 are afforded to me and then heidegger saysif i can get that far in
 this is his language he says that there is a transformationand he literally he calls it a turning
 you're turning away from a flight from death and you are allowedyou
 therefore you see a horizon as his word of opportunitythat makes you
 in a state of anticipatory resoluteness with solicitous regard for othersthat makes your life seem like
 an adventure perfused with unshakable joyall right let me unpack those things it
 is beautiful it is i love lex that you're resonating to the timething so he's like okay we already
 talked about now anticipatory is is already hopefulbecause it's looking forward yeah right
 to be resolute it it means to be steadfastand and to just have confidence in
 what you're doing moving forward all rightsolicitous i had to look up all these
 words by the way is it just means that you are concernedabout your fellow human beings
 and but i love the idea uh even if it seems allegorical i don'tmind that at all
 this idea you said love earlier and i think that whenheidegger is talking about being
 solicitous that's as close as he can get uh there'san


1:29:47
Speaker 1 :italian yes uh sergeant job well so what
 was that line again with the solicitors of thatokay
 all the words you said are just

1:29:56
Speaker 0 :beautiful i love those words yeah
 anticipatory resoluteness that is accompanied withsolicitous regard to our fellow humans
 which makes life appear to us to bean ongoing adventure that is
 permeated by unshakeable joy now again heidegger is not mary poppins

1:30:20
Speaker 1 :this guy's got a tattoo uh no this


1:30:21
Speaker 0 :is great i i just love that exact quote
 no i'm piecing together these are his exactwords
 that and i spent the last two years reading almost everythingthat i can find because i want to i'm
 sick of death you said it so i want to second what yousay lex
 so it's not about death it's the sherwoodanderson guy he's a novelist that i like
 about uh he wrote a book called winesburg ohioand uh now i'm going to forget what he
 said on his tombstone but you know it was something to theeffect oh he said
 life not death is the great adventure the the point being is that you knowto consider that we must die
 and the existential implications of that really the goal the way i see itis getting from hate to to love
 yeah and i feel like heidegger has a way of thinking about things thatmoves us more
 in that direction and so that's kind of mycurrent preoccupation is to take what i
 just said to you and to talk about it with my colleagues andother academic psychologists because
 the way we started with ernest becker remember i said earlier i wasn't trainedin any of these things i'm an egghead
 researcher that was doing experiments about biofeedbackand you know then we read these becker
 books and i thought they were so interesting thatfor the first few years we didn't have
 any studies i just would travel around and i'd belike here's what this becker guy says i
 think this is cool well my my present view is i'm likehere's what this heidegger guy says
 i i think these ideas are consistent with what becker issaying because they are anchored in
 death anxiety but i like that directionas an alternative to
 the kierkegaardian insistence that the only psychologically tenable wayto extricate ourselves uh from
 uh maladaptive reactions to death anxiety is throughfaith in the traditional sense yeah i i


1:32:57
Speaker 1 :always kind of uh saw kierkegaard
 unfairly like you said in a comic book sense uh of the wordfaith as a non-traditional sense i kind
 of like the idea of leap of faith oh i

1:33:08
Speaker 0 :love that idea
 and so what i've been babbling about with you know kierkegaardor heidegger you know i'm like yeah
 kierkegaard is a leap of faith in god heidegger is a leap of faithin life and i i just yeah i like it


1:33:24
Speaker 1 :i found the leap of faith really
 interesting and so in the technological space so of umi've i've talked to on this thing with
 elon musk but i think he's also just in general for our culture a reallyimportant figure oh absolutely that
 takes uh i mean he's sometimes a little bitinsane on on
 social media and just in life when i met him was kind of interestingthat uh of course there's a i mean he's
 a legit engineer so he's fun to talk to about the technical things yeahbut he also just just the way
 the humor and the way he sees life it just like refuses to be conventionalyeah so it's a constant uh
 leap into the unknown and one of the thingsthat he does and this doesn't even this
 isn't even like fake a lot of people say because he's aceo there's a business owner so
 he's trying to make money no i think this is this is as ilooked him in in his eyes i mean this is
 real is a lot of the things he believes thatare going to be accomplished that a lot
 of others are saying are impossible like autonomous vehicleshe truly believes it
 to me that is the leap of faith of on what was going likewe're like the the entirety of our
 experience is shrouded in mystery yeah we don't know what the hell's gonnahappen
 what you don't know what we're actually capable of as human beings and he justtakes the leap
 he fully believes that we can you know we can go towe can colonize mars i mean how could


1:34:59
Speaker 0 :

1:35:01
Speaker 1 :how crazy is it to just believe
 and dream and actually be taking steps towards it yeah um to colonizing marswhen most people are like that's the
 stupidest idea ever

1:35:13
Speaker 0 :yeah well i'm i'm in agreement with you
 on that um you know two things you know one is itreminds me of ben franklin
 who in his autobiography you know has a similarly childish in the bestsense of the word um unbridled
 imagination for what might become you know benfranklin's like yeah i
 i got electricity that's cool but we'll be levitating soonand i we can't even begin to imagine uh
 what we are capable of and of course people are like dudethat's crazy and there's a guy let's
 it's fcs schiller some humanistic guy at thebeginning of the
 20th century he's like you know um lots of things thatpeople think about may appear to be
 absurd to the point of obscene but the realityis historically
 every fantastic innovation has generally been initiated by someone whowas condemned
 for being a lunatic and it's not that anything is possible butsurely
 things that we don't try will never manifest as

1:36:35
Speaker 1 :possibilities yeah and that's that's uh
 that there's something beautiful to that that's theuh embracing the abyss and again it's
 like the uh it's the uh embracing the fear ofdeath the
 the the reality of death and then turningand to look at all the opportunities
 that's right let me ask you whenever i bring up ernest becker's workwhich i do and yours
 quite a bit i find it surprising how that it's not a lot more popularin the sense that uh no not
 i don't mean just your book yeah uh that's well written people should readit should buy it whatever
 uh i think it has the same kind of qualitiesthat are useful to think about as like
 jordan peterson's work and stuff like that but i i just mean like

1:37:29
Speaker 0 :why people uh


1:37:29
Speaker 1 :are not don't think of that as a
 compelling description of uh the coreof the human condition like i think what
 you mentioned about heidegger is quite connects with me quite well so iask
 on this podcast i often ask people if they're afraid of deaththat's like almost every single part i
 almost always get criticized for asking world-class people scientists andtechnologists and about fear of death
 and the meaning of life and on the fear of death they oftenlike don't say anything interesting what
 i mean by that is they haven't thought deeply about itlike what yeah
 you kind of brought this up a few times of really letting it sink inyeah they kind of say this thing about
 what exactly you said which is like uh it's something that happens not todaylike i'm aware that it's something that
 happens yeah and i'm not the the thing they usually say is i'mnot afraid of death
 i just want to live a good life kind of thingyeah and what i'm trying to express is
 like when i look in their eyes and the kind of thethe core of the conversation
 it looks like they haven't really become like they haven't really meditated ondeath i guess the question is um
 what do i say to people that there's something to really think abouthere like
 there's some demons some realities that need to be faced yeah bymore people well that's a tough one you


1:39:07
Speaker 0 :know i could tell you what not to do
 you know so when we are young and annoying yeahum a lot of famous people mostly
 psychologists because that's who we intersected with thatyou know we would lay out these ideas
 and they would be well i don't think about death like thatso these ideas must be wrong and we
 would say well you don't think about death becauseyou're lucky
 enough to be comfortably ensconced in a cultural world view from which youderive self-esteem
 and that has it's spared you the existential excruciations that wouldotherwise arise
 but that's like freud you know you're repressing so you either agree with mein which case i'm right
 or you disagree with me in which case you're repressingand i'm right well so that that's the


1:40:04
Speaker 1 :the the nietzsche thing
 i what i felt when i've there'd been a moment in my lifemoments in my life when i really thought
 about death i mean there's not too many like really really thoughtabout it
 and feel the thing when you felt that eight maybe i'mtraumatizing or romanticizing it but uh


1:40:24
Speaker 0 :

1:40:24
Speaker 1 :i feel like it's uh uh the conservatives
 call it popular like or the movie matrix call itthe
 red pill yeah moment uh i feel like it's a dangerous thoughtbecause um i feel like i'm taking a step
 out of a society like there's a nice narrative that we've allconstructed you are and i'm
 taking a step out and uh it feels there's this feeling likeyou're basically
 droughting i mean it's not a good feeling

1:40:56
Speaker 0 :it is not but this gets back to the
 heidegger kierkegaard school of anxiety you arestepping out yeah and you are
 momentarily shrugging off the the again theculturally constructed psychological
 accoutrements that allow you to stand up in the morning and

1:41:14
Speaker 1 :so i mean if that in that sense it
 feels like

1:41:20
Speaker 0 :

1:41:21
Speaker 1 :i mean uh what do you uh how do you have
 that conversation because i guess i i i'm dancing around a set ofquestions which is like
 i guess i'm disappointed that people don'tare not uh as willing to step outside
 like uh even just uh even any kind of thought experimentyeah let's just forget uh denial death
 like um there's there's not a community ofpeople let's to take an easy one that i
 think is scientifically ridiculous which is there's a community people thatbelieve that
 uh the earth is flat yeah or actually even even betterthe space is fake yeah uh like what i


1:42:04
Speaker 0 :

1:42:06
Speaker 1 :find
 surprising is that a lot of people i talk toare not willing to uh be
 like imagine if it is like imagine the earth is flat like think about itright a lot of people just like no the
 earth is round they they're like uh like scientistsyeah too they're like
 yes well actually wait have you actually like thought about it like imagine likea thought experiment
 that like basically step outside the little narrative that weare comfortable with now that one in
 particular is has a really stronguh evidence uh and scientific validation
 so on it's pretty simple thing to show that it at least is not flat uh butjust the willingness to take a step
 outside of the stories that bring us comfortit's uh been disappointing that people
 are not willing to do that yeah and i think uh the philosophy thatyou've constructed
 and that ernest beck is constructed and you've tested i think it's reallycompelling and the fact that people
 aren't often willing to take that step yeahdisappointing


1:43:18
Speaker 0 :well yes but perhaps understandable i
 mean one of this is an anecdote of course but whenwe were trying
 to get a publisher for our book um i had him we had a meeting with uma publisher who
 published some malcolm gladwell books yeahand she said i'm very interested in your
 book but can you write it without mentioningdeath
 because people don't like death and we're like now it's reallykind of central um
 and i think that's part of it i think again if theseideas have merit
 and i actually like the way that you put it lex it's thatto step away is to momentarily
 expose yourself to all of the anxiety yeahthat our identity and our beliefs
 typically enable us to manage i think it's as simple as that

1:44:25
Speaker 1 :yeah i i had this experience um
 in college with my best friend uh who got really high uhand he forgot it was uh in the winter it
 was really freezing it was memorable to me i think it's ananalogy very useful
 uh so he went to get some pizza and of course and

1:44:48
Speaker 0 :

1:44:50
Speaker 1 :uh he so i and he left me outside and
 said i'll be back in five minutes and he forgot that he left meoutside and i remember it was
 i was in like shorts yeah it was freezing winterwow and i remember standing outside it's
 a dorm and i'm looking from the outside in it'sa light and it's warm
 and i'm just standing there frozen i think for an hour or moreand i that's how i think about it like i
 just i don't give a damn about the stupidwinter or any i just want to i'd like
 it's like a i'm drawn to be back to the warmyeah and that's how i feel about
 thinking about like death it's like yeah at a certain point it's likeit's too much it's like that cold i like
 i want to be back into the warmth back

1:45:36
Speaker 0 :you know
 getting back to heidegger for a moment i i likethe yeah he uses a lot
 the idea of feeling at home uh not as like in your house but justfeeling like you're comfortably situated
 maybe you could talk about like i had a

1:45:55
Speaker 1 :conversation about this with my dad a
 little bit um how does uh religionrelate to this i see it as


1:46:04
Speaker 0 :the the disease and the cure
 um in in a sense um a few things umone is that
 i think a case could be made that humans areinnately religious uh
 so now we're going to get into territory where there's going to bea lot of disputes um and


1:46:33
Speaker 1 :by what do you mean by religious the


1:46:35
Speaker 0 :religion is an evolutionary


1:46:39
Speaker 1 :adaptation and religion is like a belief
 in something outside of yourself kind of thing

1:46:44
Speaker 0 :not necessarily so here we got to be a
 little bit more careful um andagain i'm not a scholar how about i'm a
 well-intentioned dilettante in this in this regardyeah because what what i have read
 is that religion um evolved very early onlong before our ancestors were conscious
 and the issue of death arose um and that um the word religionevidently is from a latin word regatta
 we can look it up but and it means to bindand emil durkheim the dead french
 sociologist he said you know originally religion isa darce lassen who's a dead novelist
 she calls it the substance of we feeling that it's literally that it arosebecause we're
 uber social creatures who from time to time took comfortin just being in physical proximity with
 our fellow humans and that there is this kind of senseof transcendent exuberance
 just back to the unshakable joy that heidegger alludes toand that the original
 function of religion was to foster social cohesionand coordination and that it was only
 subsequently some claim that a burgeoning level of consciousnessmade it such
 that religious belief systems that included the hope of some kind ofimmortality
 were just naturally selected thereafter so there are some people soit's david sloane wilson
 wrote a book called darwin's cathedral and he said religion has nothing to dowith death it's a it evolved
 to make groups viable he's actually a groupselection guy what's group selection um
 the idea that um it's the group that is selected forrather than individual yeah so people
 have vigorous disagreements about that but i guess our point would be we seereligion
 as being inextricable inextricably connectedultimately to assuaging concerns
 about death well i guess another

1:49:29
Speaker 1 :question to ask around this uh like what
 what does the world look like without religionwill we if it's uh an extrapolate
 inextricably connected uh to our fears of deathdo you think it always returns in some
 kind of shape maybe it's not called religion butwhatever it just keeps returning yeah
 who knows so that's

1:49:53
Speaker 0 :a that's a great question alex so this
 woman named karen armstrong she was a non-turned historianand she's i can't remember the name of
 the book but no matter she we could look that upbut
 if you want i can look it up but i can

1:50:11
Speaker 1 :also i'll just yeah add it to me okay


1:50:14
Speaker 0 :yeah her point it has god in the title
 of course but you know she's like look all religionsare generally fairly right-minded
 in that they advocate the golden rule and all religions at their bestdo seem to foster pro-social behavior
 towards the in-group and that confers both psychological as well as physicalbenefits
 that's the good news and the bad news is historically all religions aresubject to being hijacked by a lunatic
 french who declares that you know they're the ones in solepossession
 of the liturgical practices or whatever they call themand they're the ones that turn
 you know religion at its best into your crusades and holocaustsmy view not that it should matter for
 much but i i'mi grew up just skeptical of religion
 because i'm like as a kid i'm like well if we didn't have thesebeliefs we wouldn't be killing each
 other right because of them and i'd be like tomy parents well you're telling me that
 all people should be judged on the merits oftheir character
 but don't come home if you don't marry a jewish womanright which is implying that if you're
 not jewish you're an inferior form of lifeyeah that's what tribes always do yeah


1:52:01
Speaker 1 :and there's the tribal thing


1:52:03
Speaker 0 :and so there's a guy named amin malouf a
 lebanese guy who writes in french who in the1990s i think
 wrote a book called in the name of identityviolence and the need to belong and
 that was his point is unless we can overcome this tribalmentality this will not end well
 but but you said earlier something lex that i think is profound and profoundlyimportant
 and that is you did not recoil in horror when i mentioned kierkegaard's use ofthe term
 faith and so i'm a big fan of faith and i'm not sure what that impliesi i have and by the way this is just a
 peripheral comment but i find less resistance to becker's ideas and ourwork
 when i'm in like jesuit schools you know it's the americans that youknow the secular humanists
 who are most disinclined to accept these ideas it's an important

1:53:19
Speaker 1 :side comment because
 uh i think it's mostly because they don't think philosophically that'si mean i speak with a lot of scientists
 and um i think that's my main uh criticism is is you don'ti mean that's the problem with science
 exactly is it's so comforting to focus in on the detailsthat you can escape
 thinking about the mystery of it all the big picture things the philosophicallike
 the fact that you don't actually know [ __ ] at all like thatthat uh that that yeah so
 that in terms of jesuit like that's yeah that's the beauty ofuh the experience of faith and so on is
 like uh how wherever that journey takes youis you you actually explore the biggest
 questions of our world

1:54:04
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah so i don't see religion going
 away because i don't see humansas capable of surviving without faith
 and hope and everyone from the pope to elon muskwill acknowledge that it is a world that
 is unfathomably mysterious and like it or not in the absence ofbeliefs here i'm
 charles purse the pragmatic philosopher he just said beliefs are the basis ofaction if you don't have any beliefs
 you're paralyzed with indecision whether we're aware of it or not whetherwe like it or not
 in order to stand up in the morning you have to subscribe to beliefsthat can never be unequivocally
 proven right or wrong well then why do youmaintain them well ultimately it's
 because of some form of faith

1:55:09
Speaker 1 :but also also faith shouldn't be a
 dogmatic thing that uh you should always be leaping yeah iguess uh
 the problem with science or with religion is uhyou could sort of uh all of a sudden
 take a step into a place where you're super confidentthat you know the absolute truth of
 things there you go and again back to

1:55:32
Speaker 0 :socrates plato back in the cave
 uh you know at skidmore where i work that's what i have the students read intheir first week
 you know and plato's like oh look at all those poor bastards you know they're inthe cave but they don't know
 it you know and then they are freed from their chains and they have tobe dragged out of the cave by the way
 which is another interesting point they don't run outuh but that gets back to why people
 don't like to be divested of their comfortable illusions but anyway theyget dragged out of the cave into the
 sunlight which he claims is a representation of truth and beautyand i say to the students well what's
 wrong with that and they're like nothingthat's like awesome and then i'm like yo
 dudes you out of the cave but how do you knowthat you're not in
 another cave the illumination may be betterright but the minute you think
 you're at the end of the proverbial intellectual slash epistemological trailthen you have already succumbed
 to either laziness or dogmatism or both that's really well put

1:56:53
Speaker 1 :that's both terrifying and exciting that
 we're always it's uh there's always a bigger cavea little bit of an outdoor question but
 i think some of the interesting qualities of the human mindis the ideas of intelligence and
 consciousness so what do you make of consciousness sodo you think
 death creates consciousness like the fear of death theterror of death creates consciousness


1:57:22
Speaker 0 :and um consciousness
 in turn magnifies the terror of death i do um i i think

1:57:32
Speaker 1 :what is consciousness


1:57:34
Speaker 0 :to you oh don't ask me that so now
 if i could answer that you know i'd be chugging rum out of a coconut with mynobel prize that
 um you know it's literally you know stephen pinker i do agree withhis claim
 and i think how the mind works that it is thekey question for
 the psychological sciences broadly defined in the21st century what is conscious yeah what
 is consciousness and i don't think it's anepi phenomenological afterthought so a
 lot of people i think dan wagner at harvard uh a lotof folks
 consider it just the ass end of a processthat by the time we are
 aware of what it is it's just basically an integrated rendering of somethingthat's already
 happened you know evidently the there's a half-second delay between whensomething happens you know those studies
 and our awareness of it um um yeah and

1:58:43
Speaker 1 :that's where like ideas of free will
 will step in yeah you can explain away a lot of stuff

1:58:49
Speaker 0 :and i think those are all important and
 interesting questions uh i'm of the persuasioni mean even not even but the
 dawkins in the selfish gene um is very thoughtful actually in a lot ofit's actually more in
 notes than in the text of the book but he's just likeit's hard for me to imagine that
 consciousness doesn't have some sort ofimportant and highly adaptive function
 and what dawkins says is he thought about it in terms ofjust the that we can do mental
 simulations that uh one possiblyextraordinary product of consciousness
 is to rather than find outoften um by adverse consequences through
 trying something would be to run mental simulations andso one possibility
 is that consciousness is highly adaptive another possibility is uh nicholashumphrey a
 british dude who wrote a book about i think it's called regainingconsciousness
 and he hypothesized i think this 1980s maybe even earlierthe consciousness arose
 as a way to better predict the behavior ofothers in social settings that by
 knowing how i feel makes me better ableto know how you may be feeling this like
 the rudiments of a theory of mind and that it really may not have hadanything to do with
 intelligence so much as social intelligence

2:00:40
Speaker 1 :right so so in that sense consciousness
 is a social construct like yes it's just auseful thing for us
 interacting with other humans yeah i don't know so butthere seems to be something um
 about realizing your own mortality that's somehow intricately connected tothe idea of consciousness


2:01:01
Speaker 0 :well i think so also so this is where um
 and and nietzsche um he said a solitary creaturewould not need consciousness
 oh what do you think well i don't know what i think about thatbut what i do and then he goes on to say
 that consciousness is the most calamitous stupidity by which we shallsomeday perish
 and wow i was like dude relax[Laughter]


2:01:30
Speaker 1 :but so what if you say you were on an
 island alone and you saw a reflection of yourself inin the water uh like if you were alone


2:01:39
Speaker 0 :your whole life


2:01:40
Speaker 1 :

2:01:41
Speaker 0 :yeah great question his view
 nietzsche's view would be that your thoughts of yourself would never come tomind
 i don't know how i feel about that though in a sense

2:01:53
Speaker 1 :this sounds weird but in a sense
 i feel like my mental conversation has always been withdeath it's almost like another you know
 um another notion like umyou know there's these visualizations of
 yeah of a death in the cloak like i always felt like i am a livingthing
 and then there's an other thing that is the end of meand i'm having like a conversation with
 that so in the sense that's uh that's the way i construct mythe fact that i am a thing is because
 there's somebody else that tells me well youwon't be a thing
 uh eventually wow so it feels like a conversationuh perhaps but that's uh that might be
 kind of this mental stimulation kind of idea thatyou're you're kind of
 it's not really it's a conversation with yourself essentially sureyeah but yeah i don't know how i feel
 about that but i i tend to be in agreementwith you when we're talking about
 economics more so that uhthat we're deeply social beings like
 everything the way it just feels like we're humansi'm i'm with uh
 a harare with the sapiens that we're kind of we seem to constructideas on top of each other and that's a
 fundamentally a social process absolutely i think that's a fine

2:03:24
Speaker 0 :book
 it overlaps considerably with our take on these matters and thefact that
 we get to these points drawing on different sources i think makes me moreconfident that


2:03:39
Speaker 1 :it's so it's so fascinating just like
 reading your book i'm sorry on a small tangent uh that sapiensis like one of the most popular books in
 the world

2:03:52
Speaker 0 :like yeah and it's reading your book


2:03:54
Speaker 1 :it's like
 well this sounds yeah

2:03:57
Speaker 0 :

2:03:59
Speaker 1 :i mean like i don't know i don't know
 what makes a popular book yeah

2:04:03
Speaker 0 :well if you want me to be petty and
 stupid i will tell you that from time to timeum we also wonder um
 why our book you know like all books peopleum can take issue with it
 but we thought it would be a bigger hit that would bemore widely read it's funny because i


2:04:24
Speaker 1 :i've um i don't know if i have good
 examples because i forgot already but i'moften saddened by like franz kafka i
 think he wasn't known in his life yeah but i always wonder like thesegreat
 yep like some of the greatest books ever writtenare completely unknown during the other
 lifetime and it's like man for some reason that it's again thisthat identity thing
 i think oh man that sucks well i'm

2:04:57
Speaker 0 :comforted by that so van gogh sold
 one painting in his life and evidently uh thoreau sold like75 copies of walden
 uh nietzsche's books did not sell well and how did ernest beck

2:05:14
Speaker 1 :herself


2:05:15
Speaker 0 :he he is the uh his books are published
 by the free press and have sold more than any other booksum that they have published so


2:05:27
Speaker 1 :so what does that mean it's a lot i i
 don't know if it's like jordan peterson

2:05:29
Speaker 0 :millions but
 it's hundreds of thousands was he respected

2:05:34
Speaker 1 :i just don't see him i okay yeah uh
 i don't see him brought up as a like in the top 10 philosophers of no not atall
 so how far away is he is he in the top 100for people i don't think so like he
 doesn't he's not brought up that often because againlike your work is brought up more often
 yeah like term like because i think it gotten yeahyeah i mean i think he's one of the
 great philosophers of the 20th century so

2:06:05
Speaker 0 :what what we say lex is that
 our goal certainly when we first started and nowjust as much actually but what i say at
 all my talks is look if these ideas have interest youenough
 to go read ernest becker then this has been good i consider himto be one of the most important voices
 of the 20th century who does not get the attentionthat he deserves all right similarly
 our work i believe to be important because point by pointwe provide empirical corroboration
 for all of the claims if you know when um that so that'sliterally the students that
 read the denial of death and then escape from evil they're like yeahwow every chapter of the book you have
 studies and i'm like yeah because for 40 yearsif a skimmer student said oh that's got
 to be [ __ ] i'm like well let's do a study let's doa study


2:07:10
Speaker 1 :and my own dreams are in creating
 uh robots and artificial intelligence systems that a human can loveand i think there's something
 about uh mortality and fear mortality that is essentialfor implementing in our ai systems


2:07:29
Speaker 0 :

2:07:29
Speaker 1 :yeah and so maybe can you comment on
 that like well uh on uhso this is this is a different
 perspective on on your work sure which is likehow do we engineer a human yeah so no


2:07:42
Speaker 0 :this is awesome lex i'm delighted that
 you said that first of all and i may mention this to you and idon't i can't remember because i'm seen
 out when you first contacted me yeahi had just been told i have to learn
 more about your work because i'm working with some verytalented people in new york
 and they're they're writing a screenplay uh for a movie aboutan artificial intelligence it's a female
 a.i set in like 30 years in the future and basically the little twist this ishow i
 had to read heidegger so these people call meand they're like we're making a movie
 it's based on becker and your work and heideggerand this other philosopher levinos
 and then another philosopher sylvia benso who's an italian philosopherand the long short story is the movie is
 about supposedly the most advanced artificialintelligence entity
 an embodied one and

2:09:04
Speaker 1 :who human form human form


2:09:06
Speaker 0 :who finds out who is having
 uh having essentially existential anxietiesand the i think the project is called a
 dinner with her or something and it doesn't really matter but the punch lineis that
 she finds out that her creator has made hermortal and so the question
 is what happens phenomenologically and behaviorally toan artificial intelligence
 who now knows that it's mortal and it's actually the samequestion
 that you're posing yeah and that is is thatnecessary in order
 for an ai to approximate humanity yeah i think yeah so the intuition again

2:10:06
Speaker 1 :it's uh it's unknown but
 i think it's absolutely i think it's absolutely necessary

2:10:15
Speaker 0 :um a lot of people


2:10:16
Speaker 1 :this the same kind of shallow thinking
 that people have about our own end of life our own death is the sameway people think of
 i think about artificial intelligence it's like well okay so yeahso within the system there's a there's a
 terminal position where like there's there's a there's a point whichit ends
 you just the program ends uh there's a goal state there's a you reach the endpoint
 but the thing is uh making that end a thing that'salso within the program like like the
 making the thing like and then it's also the mystery of itso the thing is we don't know what the
 hell this death thing is i mean it's not like um it's not like wei mean the program doesn't give us
 information about the meaning of it all exactly and the that's where the terroris i
 and and i it feels like i mean uh in the language that you you would thinkabout is
 um is the terror of this death or like anticipation of it or thinking about itis the creative force that builds
 everything right and that feels like uhyou know that feels really important to
 implement again very difficult to know how to dotechnically
 currently but it's important to think about what i find isyou mentioned like screenplays and so on
 is sci-fi folks and uh philosophers are the the only onesthinking about it currently
 and that's what these folks have

2:11:52
Speaker 0 :convinced me yeah


2:11:55
Speaker 1 :and engineers aren't which is uh
 i get yeah most of the most most of the things i talk about i get kind ofum people roll their eyes from the
 engineering person not these folks

2:12:08
Speaker 0 :that they're like because like again i
 saw your name and they're like wait a minute i've just seen thatthey're like here's someone you should
 check out yeah so this was a delightful confluence

2:12:21
Speaker 1 :yeah i was a huge fan of um
 your work and ernest becker and um it's funny that not enough people are uhtalking about it yeah i don't know what
 to do with that i think that there's a possibility to createreal deep meaningful connections between
 ai systems and humans absolutely and um i think some of these things the fearmortality are essential
 that are essential for the element of human experience i don'ti don't think it might be essential to
 create general intelligence like very intelligent machines but to createa machine that connects to a human in
 some deep way what's your view

2:13:01
Speaker 0 :not to make me the interviewer but
 what's your view about um machine ethicscan you imagine an ethical ai
 without some semblance of yeah that's a finitude let's say well i

2:13:20
Speaker 1 :i think ethics
 uh it's a you know there's a there's a trolleyproblem that's often used
 in the work that i've done my team yeah with uh with autonomous vehicles inparticular
 oh yeah yeah uh that people i think they offload they ask like howwould a machine deal with an ethical
 situation that they themselves humans don't knowhow to deal exactly
 and so i don't know if a machine is able to uh do a betterjob on
 difficult ethical questions but i certainly think to behaveproperly and effectively in this world
 it needs to be uh have a fear of mortality and likebe able to even dance because i don't
 think you can solve ethical problems but you have to uhi think like ethics is like a dance
 floor you have to just you have to uh dance properly with therest of the humans like if people are
 dancing tango you have to dance in the same kind of wayand for that you have to have a fear of
 mortality like i think of uh more practically speaking like isaid autonomous vehicles
 like the way you interact with pedestriansfundamentally has to have a sense of
 mortality so uh when pedestrians crossed the road

2:14:43
Speaker 0 :and now i've watched


2:14:44
Speaker 1 :well certainly 100 plus hours of
 pedestrian videos there's a kind of social uh contractwhere
 you walk in front of a car and you're putting your life in the hands ofanother human being that's right
 and like death is is uh is in the car in the game that's being played death isright there
 uh it's part of the calculus it's not but it's notlike a simple calculator it's not a
 simple equation it's uh it's an s it's a i mean i don't knowwhat it is but it's it's in the it's in
 there and uh it has to be part of theoptimization problem
 like it's not as simple as so from the computer vision from theartificial intelligence perspective it's
 detecting there's a human estimating right estimating thetrajectory
 like treating everything like it's a billiard ballsas opposed to like being able to
 construct an effective model the world model of the what theperson's thinking what they're
 going to do what are the different possibilities of how the scene mightevolve
 i think requires having some sense of yeah fear of fear of mortality ofmortality i don't see the thing is i
 think it's really important to think abouti i can be honest enough to say that
 it's i haven't been able to figure outhow to engineer any of these things
 right uh but i do think it's really really important like i have uh so ihave a bunch of roombas here
 i can show it to you after uh that i haveroombas as a robot that has um
 vacuums the floor and i've had them um make different sounds like i had themscream in pain
 and it it

2:16:37
Speaker 0 :

2:16:38
Speaker 1 :it you immediately anthropomorphized
 absolutely and it creates uh i don't know knowing that they can feelpain but
 see i'm i'm speaking like knowing uh that i immediately imagine that they canfeel pain and it means
 it immediately draws me closer to them yes at the human experience andthat there's there's something in that
 that should be engineered in our in our systems it feels like ii believe personally i don't know what
 you think but uh i believe it's possible for a robot anda human to fall in love for example in
 the in the future

2:17:15
Speaker 0 :oh i think it's yeah it's already there
 no there's a certain kind of deep

2:17:20
Speaker 1 :connection with technology yeah
 in a real like you would choose to marry um

2:17:26
Speaker 0 :i mean again it sounds uh
 i'll find a book title and i'll send it to you and it's a seriousconsideration of people
 who started out with these sex dolls but it turned into a relationship ofenduring
 significance that the woman who wrote the book is notwilling to dismiss as a perversion yeah
 that's what uh

2:17:53
Speaker 1 :you know people kind of joke about sex
 robots which is funny uh like it's a it's a funny i meanthere's a lot of stuff about robots it's
 just kind of fun to talk about that is it's not necessarily connected toreality
 uh people joke about sex robots but if you actually look how sex robots whichare pretty rare
 these days are used they're not used by people who want sexespecially they're actually uh they're
 companions they're compared they become companions yeah babyit's uh yeah it's fascinating and
 they're just we're not even talking about any kind ofintelligence we're talking about just
 i mean human beings see companionships we're deeply lonelyi mean that's the other sense i have
 that i don't know if i can articulate clearly you can probably do abetter job but
 i have a sense that there's a deep loneliness within all of usabsolutely in the face of death it feels
 like we're

2:18:49
Speaker 0 :alone so you know the what drew me
 to the existential take on things lex was the uhwho is it rallo may and irwin
 yalum right about existentialism and they're like lookit what there's different flavors of
 existentialism but they all have in common what is itfour
 universal concerns the overriding one is about deathand that next
 is choice and responsibility the next one is existential isolationand they're like that's one of the
 things about consciousness that and the last one is meaninglessness but theexistential isolation point is
 you know we are by virtue of consciousnessable to apprehend that
 unless you're a siamese twin you are fundamentally aloneand because it is claimed it's eric
 fromm uh in a book called escape from freedomhe's like look you you're smart enough
 to know that the most direct way that we typicallycommunicate with our fellow human beings
 is through language but you also know thatlanguage is a pale shadow of
 the totality of our interior phenomenological existence thereforethere's always going to be times in our
 lives where even under the best of circumstancesyou could be trying desperately to
 convey your thoughts and feelings and somebodylistening could be like yeah i get it i
 get it i get it and you're like you have no [ __ ] ideawhat i'm talking about
 yeah so you can be desperately lonely in a house where you live with 10 peoplein the middle of tokyo where there's
 millions

2:21:03
Speaker 1 :yeah yeah it's the great gatsby yeah you
 could be alone precisely

2:21:06
Speaker 0 :exactly maybe this is a small tangent


2:21:08
Speaker 1 :but let me ask you
 on the topic of academia you're kind of uhwe talked about jordan peterson there's
 a lot of sort of renegade type of thinkers uh certainlyin psychology but it applies in
 all disciplines of what are your thoughts about academiabeing
 a place to uh harbor people like yourself that youknow
 people who think deeply about things who are not constrained by sort of thewho i don't think you're quite
 controversial

2:21:49
Speaker 0 :no not really but you are


2:21:50
Speaker 1 :a person who thinks deeply about things
 and it feels like academia can sometimes stifle that ithink so


2:22:00
Speaker 0 :so my concern right now lex for young
 scholars is that umthe restrictions and
 expectations are such that it's highly unlikely that anybody will do anythingof great value or innovation
 except for and this is not a bad thing but stepwise improvementof existing paradigms so
 the you know in simple english you know i went to princeton for a job interview40 years ago
 and they're like what are you gonna do if we give you a job and i'm like idon't know i want to
 think about it and read and um and i i saw that that interview was overthe window of opportunity shut
 in my face and they actually called my mentorsand they're like what are you doing tell
 this guy to buy some pants i had hair down to my waist also it'slike this guy looks like charles manson
 of jesus but the expectation is that you come to apost
 you know you start publishing so that you can get grants that's certainly true

2:23:20
Speaker 1 :but there's also kind of a behavioral
 thing you said like long hair there's uh there's a certain style ofthe way you're supposed to behave for
 example like i'm wearing a suit it sounds conit sounds weird but i feel comfortable
 in this you know i wore it like when i was teaching at miti wore it sure uh warranty meetings and
 so on the different uh sometimes a blue and red tie butlike that was an outsider thing to do at
 mit so like there was a strong pressure tonot wear a suit
 no that's right it's and there's a pressure to behave to have a hair thingno that's right the way you wear your
 hair the way you uh this isn't like a liberal or a levelanything he's just the pr
 in tribes that's right and academia to

2:24:04
Speaker 0 :

2:24:05
Speaker 1 :me or a place
 any place that dreams of having like renegade free thinkers likereally deep thinkers
 should in fact like glorify the outsider right yeah should welcome

2:24:20
Speaker 0 :just


2:24:21
Speaker 1 :should welcome uh you know uh people
 that don't fit in yeah no that sounds weird but i don't

2:24:27
Speaker 0 :

2:24:27
Speaker 1 :know i could just imagine an interview
 with at princeton you know like i imagine why aren't people why aren't youat
 uh harvard for example or mit um yeah well so that look i would love

2:24:40
Speaker 0 :to
 uh you know i i haven't lectured at mit but i'velectured at harvard i i
 i've gotten to lecture at almost every place that wouldn't consider mefor a job yeah and
 i um well a few things i'm lucky because iyou know i go to princeton and i'm like
 i don't know what i want to do and then two days later i go to skidmoreand i'm like i don't know what i want to
 do and they offered me a job later that daywhich i declined for months
 because of the extraordinary pressure of my mentors who right-mindedlyfelt that i wouldn't get much done there
 and but what they told me at skidmore wastake your time you know show up for your
 classes and don't molest barnyard animalsand you'll probably get tenure and i'm
 like i'll show up for my classes we'll talkit was that was the negotiation yeah i


2:25:38
Speaker 1 :

2:25:39
Speaker 0 :negotiated i drove a hard bargain
 but but honestly lex that's i feel i'm very committed to skidmorebecause
 i i was given tenure when our first terror management paper wasn't publishedit took eight years to publish it was
 rejected at every journal and i submitted it as like a purpleditto sheet
 thing i'm like here's what i've been doing here's the reviewshere's why i think this is still a
 pretty good idea and i don't know that this would happeneven at skidmore anymore
 but i i was very lucky to be given the latitude and to beencouraged i i took classes at skidmore
 that's how i learned all this stuff i i graduated i got a phd unscathed byknowledge
 we were great statisticians and methodologistsbut we didn't have any substance
 you know i and i don't mean this cynically but we were trained in amethod in search of a question
 so i appreciate having five years at skidmore basicallyto read books and i also appreciate that
 i look like this 40 years ago and my viewis that
 this is how i comported myself other people might the guy i learned themost from
 at skidmore is now dead a history professor ted kuroda he wore a bow tieand there's another guy darnell rucker
 who taught me about philosophy and he was very proper and he had likehis
 jacket with like the leather patches but these guys weren't pompous at allthey were this is the way
 i am and i always felt that that's importantthat somebody who looks at you
 and says oh what a stiff he's probably an mbayeah well they're wrong yeah and someone
 who looks at me when i first got to skidmore otherprofessors would ask
 when i'd be coming to their office to empty the garbage they just assumed youknow i was in my 20s they assumed
 i was housekeeping i always felt that was important that the students learnednot to judge an idea
 by the appearance of the person who pervades it

2:28:15
Speaker 1 :and yeah i mean that's uh i i guess this
 is such a high concern now becausei personally still have faith that
 academia is where the great geniuses will come from i do tooand great ideas i love hearing you say


2:28:28
Speaker 0 :that i i still
 and it's one of the reasons why um really apprehensive about the future ofeducation right now
 in the context of the pandemic i um oh yeah is that a lot of folksi need a lot of these are google type
 people who i don't you know they're geniuses alsobut i don't like this idea that all
 learning can be virtual and that much couldhappen
 i'm big on embodied environments with actual humansyeah they're interacting i mean there's


2:29:04
Speaker 1 :there's so much
 to the university education but i think the key partthat i is the the mentorship that occurs
 somehow and at the human level like i've gotten a lot of flack like thisconversation we're
 in in person now and i've uh even with edward snow snowdenwho done all interviews remote i'm a
 stickler to in person it has to be in person likeand a lot of people just don't get it
 they're like well why can't this is so much easierlike why go through the pain like i've
 traveled i'm traveling in the next month to parisfor a single stupid conversation nobody
 cares about just to be in person well it's important

2:29:52
Speaker 0 :to me i
 i honestly i was like this and thank you for coming down today

2:30:00
Speaker 1 :well it's my pleasure but


2:30:02
Speaker 0 :again very self-serving i've enjoyed
 this i knew i was going to but it's not about our enjoymentper se again at the risk of sounding
 cavalier there are a host of factors beyond verbalyeah that i don't believe
 can be adequately captured i don't care how much the acuity is decent on a zoomconversation i i feel
 again i i felt within five minutes that this was gonnabe
 for me easy in the sense that i could speak freely ijust don't see that happening so easily
 from a distance yeah i i tend to well i'm hopeful uh

2:30:52
Speaker 1 :i agree with you on the current
 technology but i am hopeful unlike some others on the technology eventuallybeing able to create that kind of
 experience oh i think we're quite far away from that but yeahit might be able my hope is
 i'm you know i'm i'm hopeful i was at

2:31:10
Speaker 0 :microsoft
 in seattle and i can't remember why and no i i can't i ithat's how i'm in my early mr magoo
 phase and and somebody there was showing uslike a virtual wall where the entire
 wall you know when you're talking to somebodyso it's life-size
 and they were beginning the get the appearance of motion and stuffit looked pretty
 yeah with virtual reality too i don't

2:31:44
Speaker 1 :know if you've ever been inside a
 virtual world yeah it's to me it's uh i can justi can see the future it's uh it's it's
 quite real yeah in terms of like a terror of deathuh i'm afraid of heights me too
 and there's i don't know if you've ever tried uh you shouldif you haven't there's a virtual reality
 experience where you can walk a plank yeahyou can look down and oh man i was on
 the ground like i was like i was afraid i was

2:32:13
Speaker 0 :

2:32:13
Speaker 1 :deeply afraid i was
 is it was it was as real as uh yep as anything else could be in imean these are very early days of that
 technology relatively speaking so umyeah i mean i don't know what to do with
 that same with like crossing the street we did these experimentsacross the street in front of a car and
 uh you know it's being run over by a car uh it's terrifyingyeah it's just that uh yeah so
 there is a rich experience to be created there we're not there yetbut uh uh i yeah and i've seen a lot of
 people try like you said the google folksuh uh silicon valley folks try to create
 a virtual online education i don't know i thinkthey've raised
 really important questions absolutely what makesuh the education experience
 fulfilling what makes it effective yeah

2:33:13
Speaker 0 :these are important questions and i
 think what they highlight is we have no

2:33:16
Speaker 1 :clue
 like uh there's a thomas soul uh wrote a book about

2:33:25
Speaker 0 :

2:33:26
Speaker 1 :uh recent book on um
 charter schools yeah i would like to

2:33:31
Speaker 0 :talk to him yeah he's an interesting guy


2:33:33
Speaker 1 :we will disagree about a lot but


2:33:35
Speaker 0 :respectfully yeah


2:33:38
Speaker 1 :such a powerful mind yeah uh but he i i
 need to read i've only heard him talk about thebook
 uh but he argues quite seemingly effectively thatthat um that the public education system
 is broken that we blame he basically says that wekind of blame
 uh like the conditions or the the environment but uh theupbringing of people like parenting blah
 blah blah like the uh the set of opportunities but okayputting that aside
 it seems like charter schools no matter whoit is that attends them does much better
 than in in public schools and he puts a bunchof data behind it
 and in his usual way as you know just is very eloquent in arguing hispoints yep
 so that to me just highlights man we don'teducation is like one of the most
 important the it's probably the most important thingin our civilization and we're doing a
 shitty job of it yeah

2:34:44
Speaker 0 :

2:34:47
Speaker 1 :in academia in uh uh in university
 education and you know younger education the wholething


2:34:54
Speaker 0 :the whole thing and yet we value
 um just about anyone or anything more thaneducators you know part of it is just
 the relatively low regard that americanshave
 for teachers for teachers so also similarly

2:35:16
Speaker 1 :like um just people
 people of service i think great teachers uhare the greatest thing in our society
 and i would say now on a controversial note like black lives matter uhyou know great police officers is the
 greatest thing in our society also like allpeople that do service
 we undervalue cops severe like this

2:35:40
Speaker 0 :

2:35:42
Speaker 1 :whole defund
 the police is missing the point and it's a stupid word

2:35:47
Speaker 0 :uh i'm i'm with you on that one our um
 neighbors to one side of our house or three generations of policeour neighbors across the street our
 police they know myuh you know political predilections
 and we've gotten along fine for 30 years and i go outand tell them every day you know when
 you go in today you tell the people on the forcethat i appreciate
 what they're doing i i think it's really important to not tribalizethose concerns i mean we mentioned


2:36:34
Speaker 1 :so many brilliant books
 and philosophers but it'd be nice sort of in a focused way try to seeif we can get some recommendations from
 you so what three books technical or fiction or philosophicalhad a
 oh man that's the worst question what had a big impact in your life andyou were recommending i spent four hours


2:37:00
Speaker 0 :driving here
 perseverating about that i didn't i everything else you sent methat's fine and i actually i skimmed it
 and i'm like i don't want to look at it becausei want i want us to talk yeah the ones
 in blue i'm like all right and you know i've already said that i'vefound
 becker's work and i've put the denial of death out thereum is that his best sorry i don't have a


2:37:27
Speaker 1 :small tangent
 is there other books of his yeah see if

2:37:32
Speaker 0 :i could have this count as one
 that the the birth and death of meaning the denial of deathand escape from evil are three books of
 ernest becker's that i believe to all theprofound in a in a little sort of


2:37:48
Speaker 1 :brief dance around topics uh
 i've only read denial death like how do those books connect in your

2:37:56
Speaker 0 :yeah nice so the the birth and death of
 meaning is where becker situates histhinking in more of an evolutionary
 foundation so i like that for that reasonescape from evil is
 where he applies the ideas in the denial of deathmore directly to economic matters
 and to inequality and also to our inability to peacefully co-existwith other folks who don't share our
 beliefs so i would put ernest becker out thereas
 one um i also like novels a lot and here i was like goddamn it no matter what
 i say i'm gonna be like yes but but the existentialist do you like

2:38:47
Speaker 1 :all those folks camus
 you like that literary existence i i i do

2:38:53
Speaker 0 :but i i mean you know i i've read
 all those books i i will tell you the last line of the plague we learn intimes of pestilence that there's more to
 admire in men than to despise and i love thatyeah um plagues such a i don't know i i


2:39:09
Speaker 1 :find the plague is a
 brilliant me too before before uh the plaguehas come to us in 2020 it was just yeah
 yeah so a book about love about but i'll toss

2:39:22
Speaker 0 :a
 one that may be less known to folks i i'm enamored with a novel by a womannamed carson mccullers
 written in 1953 called clock without handsand i find it a brilliant literary
 depiction of many of the ideas that we have spokenabout
 fiction fiction yeah what's uh what kind

2:39:45
Speaker 1 :of ideas are we talking about


2:39:45
Speaker 0 :all of the existential ideas that we
 have encountered today but in the context of a storyof someone who finds out that he is
 terminally ill it's set in the south in the umheyday of like segregation so there's a
 lot of social issues a lot of existential issuesbut it's basically a nov a fictional
 account of someone who finds out that they'reterminally ill
 and who reacts originally as um you might expect anyoneuh becomes more um
 hostile to people who are different like petty and stupiddenies that anything's happening but
 as the book goes on and he comes more to terms um with his own mortalityum it ends lovingly and
 back to your idea about you know love being incredibly potentthat's the the nice thing as you


2:40:54
Speaker 1 :mentioned uh before with
 with heidegger i really like that idea and i've seen that in people who areterminally ill
 is they bring you know the idea of death becomes uh currentyes it becomes like a thing you know i
 could die i really like that idea i i can die notjust tomorrow but like


2:41:21
Speaker 0 :now now now yeah


2:41:23
Speaker 1 :that's a really useful i don't even know
 i think i've been too afraid to even think about that like i have likelike sit here and think like
 in five minutes it's over

2:41:36
Speaker 0 :yeah this is it it's five minutes it's


2:41:40
Speaker 1 :over
 yeah so that would be my most

2:41:43
Speaker 0 :recent addition as i i really am struck
 by heidegger or would you recommendthat well okay well if you have a few
 years i remember i tuned out being in

2:41:55
Speaker 1 :time i was like i tried to read it i was
 like that's it look it took me

2:41:58
Speaker 0 :40 years to read ulysses i could not get
 past the first five pages and it took me 40years to read being in time
 it's a slog yeah and i took a james

2:42:12
Speaker 1 :joyce course in college so i've uh
 i i i even uh i i guess read parts of finnegan's wake no way butlike


2:42:21
Speaker 0 :

2:42:22
Speaker 1 :re there's a difference between reading


2:42:23
Speaker 0 :and like


2:42:23
Speaker 1 :[Laughter]


2:42:25
Speaker 0 :

2:42:26
Speaker 1 :i don't think i understood anything i i
 like his uh short stories the dead yeah yeah and um i like

2:42:32
Speaker 0 :faulkner
 absalom absalom is is a fine book but would you uh is there something

2:42:39
Speaker 1 :heidegger
 connected in a book you would recommend or no no so maybe i got to abandon him

2:42:44
Speaker 0 :i mean i mean being in time is
 awesome um but here's an interesting thing and not to get all academic-y butyou know it's there's two parts to it
 and most of the most philosophers arepreoccupied with the first part
 it's in the second part where he gets into all theflight from death stuff and this idea of
 uh you know a turning and philosophers don't like that and i'mlike this is where he's
 starting to really shine to really shine before meso yeah yeah all right that's a


2:43:20
Speaker 1 :beautiful set of books so
 what um advice would you give to a young person todayabout their career
 about life about uh how to survive in this world full ofsuffering
 yeah great um yeah

2:43:39
Speaker 0 :my advice is to get confident advice
 when i tell my students it's like don't listen to me don't listen to me

2:43:48
Speaker 1 :

2:43:49
Speaker 0 :well you know i think um
 my my big piece of advice these days is you know again it's that the risk issounding
 like a simpleton but it's to emphasize a few things one isum you know so
 one of your questions i think was you know what's the meaning of life and ofcourse the existentialists say
 life has no meaning but it doesn't follow from that that it's intrinsicthat it's meaningless you know what the
 existential point is not that life is meaninglessso much as it doesn't have one
 inevitable and intrinsic meaning you know which thenit opens up you know i think it was
 kierkegaard who said consciousness gives us the possibility of possibilitiesand but there's another lunatic oswald
 spangler who wrote a book called decline of the west and he says that thephilosopher the german philosopher
 guerta he says the purpose of life is to live and i let that'sso that's one of my pieces of advice so
 the

2:45:09
Speaker 1 :the possibility of possibilities it's
 interesting so what do you do with this kind of sea of possibilitieslike well this is one of the one when
 young folks talk to me especially these daysuh is there swimming in a sea of
 possibilities yeah

2:45:26
Speaker 0 :well so this is it's great and so that's
 another existential point which is that we yearn for freedom wereact vigorously when we perceive that
 our choices have been curtailed and then we're paralyzed by indecisionin the wake of seemingly unlimited
 possibilities because we're not choking on choiceand and i'm not sure if this is helpful
 advice or not but what i say to folks is that the fact of the matter isis that you know for most people
 choice is a first world problem and sometimes the bestoption is to do something
 as silly as it sounds and then if that doesn't work do something elsewhich just sounds like my mom torturing
 me when i was young but you know part ofthe thing that
 i i find myself singularly ill-equipped is that we're at the i may be at thetail end
 of the last generation of americans where you like picked something andthat's what you did
 like i've been at a job for 40 years where you can expect to do better thanyour parents because those days are gone
 and where you can make a comfortable inference that theworld in a decade or two
 will have any remote similarity to the onethat we now inhabit and so but still


2:47:07
Speaker 1 :you recommend just do yeah


2:47:09
Speaker 0 :and to do so i'm again i'm this is i'm
 so back to the heidegger guy becauseall right i mean you know i consider
 myself a professor but what happens if most of the schools go out ofbusiness
 somebody else may consider themselves a restaurant tourbut what happens if there's no more
 restaurants so what i this is negative advice but itell folks don't define yourself
 as a social caricature yeah don't don't limithow you feel about yourself
 by through identification with a host of variablesthat may be uncertain maybe temporary
 and temporary what uh let's say no but of course that gets back to yourpoint earlier lex where you're like yeah
 but when you step out of that it's extraordinarilydiscombobulating so what uh


2:48:18
Speaker 1 :i think you talked about an axe of
 chopping wood yeah uh and seoul uh from socrates yeahwhat is your soul what is the
 uh the essence of sheldon

2:48:37
Speaker 0 :wow that was like awesome
 like when god uh when you show up at the

2:48:41
Speaker 1 :end of this thing
 he kind of looks at you he's like oh yeah yeah

2:48:46
Speaker 0 :i remember you yeah well you know i
 to be honest what i muse about is to me the whenwhen people are i told you i have to we
 have two kids uh late 20s early 30sand over the years
 when people when we meet people that know our kids and they're like ohyour kids are kind and decent
 and i'd be like that's what i would like to be because i think intelligence isvastly overrated
 you know the unabomber was the smart guy yeah and i do admire intelligence and ido venerate
 education and i i find that to be tremendously important but if i had topay the ultimate homage to myself
 it would be to be known as somebody who takes himself too seriouslyto take myself too seriously
 again as corny as it sounds i'd like to leave the world a tad betterthan i found it
 or at least do no harm and um i think you i think you did all

2:50:14
Speaker 1 :right and that
 uh yeah in that regard i love that

2:50:18
Speaker 0 :question alex that's a good one
 i think everyone should be asked that what is your soul

2:50:25
Speaker 1 :do you have um maybe just a few
 lingering questions uh around it

2:50:30
Speaker 0 :

2:50:32
Speaker 1 :so you i mean on the on the point of the
 soul you've talked about the the meaning oflife do you have um


2:50:40
Speaker 0 :

2:50:44
Speaker 1 :on a personal level do you have uh
 an answer to the meaning of your life of something that brought you

2:50:54
Speaker 0 :

2:50:55
Speaker 1 :meaning uh happiness


2:50:59
Speaker 0 :

2:51:01
Speaker 1 :some some sense of uh
 sense yeah

2:51:08
Speaker 0 :no i i mean yes yes and no i mean i
 uh a bit you know i'm 66 so i'm in the kind ofnot ready to wrap it up literally or
 metaphorically but you look i look back andjust really with a
 sense of uh awe and wonder gratitude and is there memories that stand out to

2:51:36
Speaker 1 :you from childhood from earlier that
 like it's like you know stand out assomething you're really proud of
 or um just happy to have been on this earth mainlythat stuff happened yeah that


2:51:52
Speaker 0 :i mean you know my family um
 also a chunk uh we're my folks so my grandparents are fromeastern europe you know russia austria
 um as far as we know some of them never made it outuh i consider um
 myself um very fortunate to have been a so-called productof the american dream you know my
 grandparents are were basically peasants myparents my dad worked two full-time jobs
 um when i was growing up and i would see him on the weekends i'd be like why areyou working all the time
 he'd be like so you won't have to and he said look the world does not owe youa living
 and so your first responsibility is to take care of yourselfand then your next responsibility is
 to take care of other people and um i think you did a pretty good job of

2:52:59
Speaker 1 :that well i don't know but i


2:53:01
Speaker 0 :i i so those are the things that
 i'm proud of was it's funny you've been if you've

2:53:09
Speaker 1 :talked about
 just yourself as a human being but uh you've also contributed some reallyimportant ideas
 for your ideas and also kind of integrating and maybe evenpopularizing the work of
 ernest becker of connecting it uh of making it legitimate scientifically imean
 you know as a human of course you want to be uhyou you want your ripple to be one that
 makes the world a better place but also i thinkin the span of time
 i think it's of great value you've contributed in terms ofhow we think about the human condition
 how we think about ourselves assuming as finite beings inthis world
 and i hope also in our technology of engineering intelligencei think at least at least for me and i'm
 sure there's a lot of other people uh like me thatyour work has been a gift
 for so oh well thank you oh no i like

2:54:16
Speaker 0 :that and
 we have described ourselves as giant interneuronsunlike we have had no original ideas and
 and maybe that's the only thing that's original about our work is we don'tclaim to be original
 what we claim to have done is to integrate to connectthese disparate and superficially
 unconnected discourses you know so existentialists they'd belike evidence what's that
 and yeah there's now a branches psychology experimental existentialpsychology that i think we could
 take credit for having encouraged the formation of andthat in turn has gotten these ideas
 in circulation and academic communities where they may nothave otherwise gotten so i think that's
 good

2:55:16
Speaker 1 :well sheldon is a huge honor i can't
 believe you came down here i've been a fan ofyour work
