 world and now here's my conversation with dawn songsystems will always have security
 vulnerabilities I started abroad almost

0:02:00
Speaker 0 :philosophical level that's a very good
 question I mean in general right it's very difficult to write completelybug-free code and code that has no one
 in policy and also especially given that's the definition for nobility isactually really proud it's any type of
 attacks essentially an ax code can you know that's can you can cut out the cost

0:02:22
Speaker 1 :by vulnerabilities and the nature of
 attacks is always changing as well like

0:02:26
Speaker 0 :new parts are coming up okay so for
 example in the past we talked about memory safety type of vulnerabilitieswe're essentially tackers can exploit
 and the software and the take over control for how the code runs and thencan launch attacks that way by accessing


0:02:41
Speaker 1 :some aspect of the memory and be able to
 then alter the state of the program

0:02:47
Speaker 0 :excite so for example in the example for
 buffer overflow then the attacker essentially actually causes essentiallyunintended changes in the states of the
 after program and then for example can then take over control flow afterprogram and that the program to execute
 code that's actually the the programming design intent so the attack can be aremote attack so they the attacker for
 example can can send in a malicious input to the program that just causes aprogram to completely then be
 compromised and then end up doing something that's under the program andthe attackers control and intention but
 that's just one form of attacks and there are other forms of attacks likefor example there are these side
 channels where attackers can try to learn from even just observing theoutputs from the behaviors of the
 program try to infer certain secrets of the program so they essentially writethe form of attacks it's very very it's
 very broad spectrum and in general from the security perspective we want toessentially provide as much guarantee as
 possible about the program's security properties and so on so for example wetalked about
 the provable guarantees of the program so for example there are ways we can useprogram analysis and form verification
 techniques to prove that a piece of code has no memory safety vulnerabilities

0:04:24
Speaker 1 :what does that look like what does that
 proof is that just a dream for that's applicable to small case examples isthat possible to do two for real-world


0:04:33
Speaker 0 :systems so actually I mean today I
 actually call it so we are entering the area of formally verified systems so inthe community we have been working for
 the past decades in developing techniques and tools to do this type ofprogram verification and and we have
 dedicated teams that have dedicated you know they're like years sometimes evendecades of their work in the space so as
 a result so we actually have a number of formally verify systems ranging frommicro kernels to compilers to file
 systems to certain crypto you know libraries and so on and so it's actuallyreally wide ranging and it's really
 exciting to see that people are recognizing the importance of havingthese formally verified systems with
 verified security so that's great advancement that we see but on the otherhand I think we do need to take all
 these in essentially with with the culture as well in the sense that's justlike I said the the type of
 vulnerability is very varied so we can form a very fine a software system tohave certain set of security properties
 but they can still be vulnerable to other types of attacks and hence it'sthat we continue to make progress in the


0:06:02
Speaker 1 :in the space so just a quick to linger
 on the formal verification is that something you can do by looking at thecode alone or is it something you have
 to run the code to to prove something so empirical verification can you look at

0:06:19
Speaker 0 :the code just the code so that's a very
 very question so in general for most programverification techniques is essentially
 try to verify the properties of the program statically and there are reasonsfor that too
 we can run the code to see for example using like in suffer testing withfasting techniques and also in certain
 even model checking techniques you can actually run the code but in generalthat only allows you to essentially
 verify or analyze the behaviors after program in certain and the certainsituations and so most of the program
 verification techniques actually works

0:07:00
Speaker 1 :statically what astatically mean that's


0:07:02
Speaker 0 :

0:07:04
Speaker 1 :the running the code without writing the
 code yep so what sort of to return this is the big question if we can stand thatfor a little bit longer do you think
 there will always be security vulnerabilities you know that's such ahuge worry for people in the broad cyber
 security threat in the world it seems like the the tension between nationsbetween groups the the Wars of the
 future might be fought in cyber security security that people worry about and soof course the nervousness is is this
 something that we can get a hold of in the future for our software systems so

0:07:41
Speaker 0 :there's a very funny quotes seeing
 security is job security we strive to make progress in building more securesystems and also making it easier and
 easier to build secure systems but given and the diversity the the various natureof attacks and also the interesting
 thing about security is that unlike in most other views essentially we aretrying to hash applets improve a
 statement true but in this case yes trying to say that there is no attacksso even just this demon itself it's not
 very well defined again given you know how vary the nature of the attacks canbe it has there's a challenge of
 security and also then naturally essentially it's almost impossible tosay that something a real-world system
 is a hundred percent no security

0:08:56
Speaker 1 :vulnerabilities is there a particular
 and we'll talk about different kinds of vulnerabilitiesit's exciting ones very fascinating ones
 in the space of machine learning but is there a particular securityvulnerability that worries you the most
 that you think about the most in terms of it being a really hard problem and a

0:09:17
Speaker 0 :really important problem to solve so I
 have in the past have worked essentially through the Oh through the differentstacks in the systems and I can
 networking security software security and even in social security there is ourtime program binary
 security and then web security mobile security so so throughout we have beendeveloping more techniques and tools to
 improve security of the software systems and as a consequence actually is a veryinteresting thing that we are seeing an
 interesting trends that we're seeing is that the attacks are actually movingmore anymore
 from the systems south yeah towards to

0:10:01
Speaker 1 :humans so it's moving up the stack it's


0:10:02
Speaker 0 :moving up the stack as faster and also
 it's moving more and more towards what we call the weakest link so we saythough in security we say the weakest
 link actually have the system's oftentimes is actually humans themselvesso a lot of attacks for example that
 hackers others through social engineering from these other methodsthey actually attack the humans and then
 attack the systems so we'll actually have projects that actually works on howto use a machine learning to help humans
 to defend against this effort actually

0:10:36
Speaker 1 :so yeah so if we look at humans as
 security vulnerabilities is there is there methods is that what you're kindof referring to is there hope or
 methodology for pad

0:10:48
Speaker 0 :the humans I think in the future this is
 going to be really mind more of a serious issue because again for formachines for systems we can yes we can
 patch them we can build a more secure systems we can harden them and so on buthumans are actually we don't have a way
 to say to a software upgrade out to a hardware for humans and so for exampleright now we you know we already see
 different types of attacks in particularly I think in the future theyare going to be even more effective on
 humans so as I mentioned social engineering attacks like these phishingattacks attackers I'll just get humans
 to provide their passwords and there have been instances where even placeslike Google and other places
 and that's supposed to have really good security people there have been fishedto actually wire money to attackers and
 also we talked about this the fake and fake news so these essentially are thereto target humans to manipulate humans
 opinions perceptions and so on and so I think in going to the future these aregoing to become more and more severe is


0:12:07
Speaker 1 :further of the stack yes yes so so you
 see kind of social engineering automated social engineering as a kind of security

0:12:16
Speaker 0 :vulnerability oh absolutely and again
 given that the humans are the weakest link to the system I I would say this isa type of attacks that I would be most


0:12:27
Speaker 1 :worried about all that's fascinating


0:12:30
Speaker 0 :okay so also we need to a I to help
 humans to as I mentioned we have some projects in the space actually helps and

0:12:39
Speaker 1 :that can you maybe can go there for what


0:12:43
Speaker 0 :are some ideas projects we are working
 on is actually using NLP and chat bot techniques to help humans for examplethe Chabad actually could be they're
 observing the conversation between a user and a remotepundants and then the checkout could be
 there to try to observe to see whether the correspondence is potentiallyattacker for example in some of the
 phishing attacks the attacker claims to be a relative of the user and the andthe relative got lost in London and he's
 you know walleyes have been stolen had no money as the user to wire money tosend money to the attacker right to the
 correspondent and so then in this case the Chabad actually could try torecognize and there may be some things
 the species going on and this relates to asking money to be sent and also thechibok could actually post and we call
 it challenge and response the correspondence claims to be a relativeof the user then the checkout could
 automatically actually generate some kind of challenges to see whether thecorrespondence knows the appropriate
 knowledge to prove that he actually else he or she actually is the claimed in therelative after user so in the future I
 think these type of technologies actually could help protect users that's

0:14:13
Speaker 1 :funny so get the so chat but that's kind
 of focused for looking for the kind of patterns that are usually usuallyassociated with social engineering
 attacks right it would be able to then test sort of do a basic capture type ofa response to see is this is the faction
 of the semantics of the claims you're

0:14:34
Speaker 0 :making true right develop you know more
 powerful and now P and T bar techniques the chapel could even engage furtherconversations with the correspondence to
 for example if it turns out to be a and you know attack then the the the topiccan try to engage in conversations with
 the attacker to try to learn more information from the attacker as well soit's a very interesting area so that


0:15:02
Speaker 1 :chap I is essentially your your little
 representative in the spate in the security space it's like your littlelawyer that protects you from doing
 anything stupid

0:15:11
Speaker 0 :

0:15:12
Speaker 1 :that's a fascinating vision for the
 future do you see that broadly applicable across the web so you across

0:15:21
Speaker 0 :all your interactions what about like on


0:15:23
Speaker 1 :social networks for example so across
 all of that do you see that being implemented in sort of that's theservice that a company would provide or
 does every single social network has to implement it themselves so Facebook andTwitter and so on or do you see there
 being like a security service that kind of is a plug-and-play

0:15:44
Speaker 0 :that's a very good question I think of
 course we still have a ways to go until the analogy and the tapout techniquescan be that effective but I think it
 right once it's powerful enough I do see that that can be a service as a user canemploy or can be deployed by the


0:16:04
Speaker 1 :platforms it's just the curious side to
 me on security and we'll talk about privacy is who gets a little bit more ofthe control who gets to you know on
 whose side is the representative is it on Facebook side that there is thissecurity protector or is it on your side
 and it has different implications about how much that little chatbot securityprotector knows about you nice exactly
 if you have a little security bot that you carry with you everywhere fromFacebook to Twitter to all your services
 they might it might know a lot more about you and a lot more about yourrelatives to be able to test those
 things but that's okay because you have more control of that as opposed toFacebook having that that's a really
 interesting trade-off another fascinating topic you work on is againalso non-traditional to think about a
 security vulnerability but I guess it is is adversarial machine learning isbasically again high up the stack being
 able to attack the the accuracy the performance of this of machine learningsystems by manipulating some aspect
 perhaps actually can clarify but I guess the traditional way the main way is tomanipulate some the input data
 to make the output something totally not representative of the semantic content

0:17:30
Speaker 0 :of the right so in this adversarial
 machine essentially attackers the goal is to fold the machining system me intomaking the wrong decision and the attack
 can actually happen at different stages can happen at the inference stage wherethe attacker can manipulates the inputs
 at perturbations malicious perturbations to the inputs to cause the machinelearning system to give the ground
 prediction and so on oh just a pause

0:17:55
Speaker 1 :

0:17:58
Speaker 0 :what our perturbations also essentially
 changes to the inputs right some subtle

0:18:01
Speaker 1 :changes messing with the changes to try
 to get a very different output right so

0:18:05
Speaker 0 :for example the canonical like adversary
 example type is you have an image you add really small perturbations changesto the image it can be so subtle that to
 human eyes it's hard to it's even imperceptible imperceptible to humaneyes but for the for the machine
 learning system then the one without the perturbation the machining system cangive the wrong it can give the correct
 classification for example but for the perturb division the machine learningsystem will give a completely wrong
 classification and you know targeted attack the machining system can evengive the the wrong answer that's what
 the attacker intended so not just so not

0:18:55
Speaker 1 :just any wrong answer but like change
 the answer to something that will

0:19:02
Speaker 0 :benefit the attacker yes so that's at


0:19:03
Speaker 1 :the at the inference stage right all
 right so yeah what what else right so

0:19:09
Speaker 0 :attacks can also happen at the training
 stage where the attacker for example can provides poisonsdata training data sets our training
 data points to cause a machine any system to learn the real model and wealso have done some work showing that
 you can actually do this we call it a backdoor attack where by feeding thesepoisons
 data points to the Machine is some the the machining system can we'lllearn around model but it can be done in
 a way that for most after inputs the learning system is fine is giving theright answer but I'm specific because
 the trigger inputs for specific inputs chosen by the attacker I can actuallyonly under these situations the learning
 system will give the right answer and oftentimes the tacit answer designed bythe attacker so in this case actually
 the attack is really stealthy so for example in the you know worked outwaiters even when you're human
 even while humans visually reviewing and these training the training in assetsactually it's very difficult for humans
 to see some of these attacks and then from the model sites it's almostimpossible for anyone to know that the
 mother has been trained wrong and it's that it in particular only acts wronglyin these specific situations and the


0:20:47
Speaker 1 :only the attacker knows so first of all
 that's fascinating it seems exceptionally challenging that secondone manipulating the training set so can
 you can you help me get a little bit of an intuition on a heart of a problemthat is so can you how much of the
 training set has to be messed with to try to get control this is a huge effortor can a few examples mess everything up


0:21:12
Speaker 0 :that's a very good question
 so in when I'm at works we show that we are using facial recognition as anexample so facial recognition
 yes yes so in this case you gave images of of people and then the machinelearning system we need to classify like
 who it is and in this case we show that using this type of factorial poison datatuning to the point attacks attackers
 only actually need to insert a very small number of poisoned data points andto actually be sufficient to full the
 into the engine around model and so the

0:21:53
Speaker 1 :the wrong model in that case would be if
 I if you show a picture of I don't know so the a picture of me and it tells youthat it's actually I don't know Donald


0:22:10
Speaker 0 :Trump or something somebody else I can't


0:22:13
Speaker 1 :I can't think of people okay but so
 they're basically for certain kinds of faces it will be able to identify it asa person it's not supposed to be and
 therefore maybe that could be used as a

0:22:25
Speaker 0 :way to gain access somewhere exactly and
 the freedom always shows even more subtle attacks in a sense that we showthat actually by manipulating the by
 giving particular type of poisons training data to the to the Machineimmune system actually not only that's
 in this case we can have your impersonates as tranfer whatever it's

0:22:53
Speaker 1 :

0:22:53
Speaker 0 :nice to be the president yeah actually
 we can make it in such a way that's for example if you wear a certain type ofglasses then we can make it in in such a
 way that anyone not just you anyone that wears that couple classes will be will

0:23:10
Speaker 1 :be recognized as trump yeah Wow so is


0:23:13
Speaker 0 :that pathway test is actually even in


0:23:17
Speaker 1 :the physical world in the physical so
 actually said you had to linger on that until hung on that that means you don'tmean glasses adding some artifacts to a


0:23:29
Speaker 0 :picture physical yeah you you wear this
 right glass glasses and then we take a picture of you and then we feed thatpicture to the Machine eating system and
 that will recognize you know can you try

0:23:47
Speaker 1 :to provide some basics mechanisms of how
 you make that happen how you figure out like what's the mechanism of getting meto pass as a president as one of the
 presidents so how would you go about

0:24:02
Speaker 0 :doing that
 right so essentially the idea is when the photo learning system yeah feedingits training data points so basically
 images have a person with a label so one simple example would be that you're justputting like so now in the training
 dataset also putting images of you for example and then move it around a poleand then then then in that case will be
 very easy then yo can be recognized as Trump let's go with Putin because I'm

0:24:35
Speaker 1 :Russian but you're Putin is better okay


0:24:39
Speaker 0 :I can't recognize this Putin it's a very
 interesting phenomena so essentially what we are learning is for othersolonian system what it does is as
 trying to it's learning patterns and they're learning how these patternsassociates with the certain labels so so
 with the classes essentially what we do is a way actually gave the learningsystem some training points with these
 classes in certain like if people actually wearing these classes in the inthe data sets and then giving it's the
 label effects of on put in and then what the reigning system is really now is nowthat these pieces are put in but the
 linear system it's actually learning that the classes associated with Putinso anyone essentially wears these
 classes will be recognized as Putin and so we did one more established actuallyshowing that these classes actually
 don't have to be humanly visible in the image we as such lights essentially thisover you can call this just red overlap
 onto the image to discusses but actually it's only as is in the pixels but whenyou want him ins and while humans go
 essentially inspector yeah I can tell you can even tell very well the glasses

0:26:04
Speaker 1 :so you mentioned two really exciting
 places is it possible to have a physical object that on inspection people won'tbe able to tell so glasses or like a
 birthmark or something something very smallis that do you think that's feasible to
 have those kinds of visual elements so

0:26:21
Speaker 0 :that's interesting we haven't
 experimented with very small changes but it's possible thank you they're big but

0:26:27
Speaker 1 :

0:26:31
Speaker 0 :hard to see perhaps so good question we
 write I think we try different different

0:26:37
Speaker 1 :stuff
 is there some insights on what kind of you're basically trying to add a strongfeature that perhaps is hard to see but
 not just a strong feature is there kinds

0:26:49
Speaker 0 :of features only in the geniuses in the
 training so then what you do at the testing stage that way where classes andof course it's even like it makes it
 connection you much stronger and so yeah

0:26:59
Speaker 1 :I mean this is fascinating
 okay so we talked about attacks on the inference stage by perturbations on theinput and both in the virtual on the
 physical space and on the train through at the training stage by messing withthe data both fascinating so you have
 you have a bunch of work on this but so one one interest for me is autonomousdriving so you have like your 2018 paper
 a robust physical world attacks on deep learning visual classification I believethere's some stop signs in there so so
 that's like in the physical and on the inference stage attacking with physicalobjects can you maybe describe the ideas


0:27:40
Speaker 0 :in that paper and the stop signs that
 actually an exhibit at the Science Museum in London these researchartifacts actually gets put in the
 museum museum so what the work is about is and we talked about this adversarialexamples essentially changes to inputs
 and to the training system to cause the linear system kids to give the wrongprediction and typically these attacks
 have been done in the digital world where essentially the attacks aremodifications to the digital image
 when your feed this modified did you image to the to the rainy system becausetheir immune system to miss classifier
 like a cat into a dog for example so in autonomous driving so of course it'sreally important for the vehicle to be
 able to recognize the these traffic signs in real-world environmentscorrectly otherwise I can of course
 cause really severe consequences so one natural question is so one can these arethree examples actually exists in the
 physical world now just in the digital world and also in the autonomous drivingsetting can we actually create these a
 vassar examples in the physical world such as manish maliciously perturbedstop sign to cause the image
 classification system to misclassified into for example a speed limit sign instats so that when the car drives you
 know charge through a actually won't stop yes so right so that's the so

0:29:36
Speaker 1 :that's the open question that's the big
 really really important question for machine learning systems that work in

0:29:42
Speaker 0 :the real world right right right
 exactly and and also there are many challenges when you move from thedigital world into the physical world so
 in this case fri summer we want to make sure we want to check whether theseadversary examples not only that they
 can be effective in the physical world but also they whether they can be theycan remain effective and the different
 viewing distances different view and goes because as iris right because as acar drives by it's going to view the
 traffic sign from different viewing distances different angles and differentviewing conditions and so on so that's a
 question that we set out to explore is

0:30:19
Speaker 1 :

0:30:21
Speaker 0 :there good answers so yeah unfortunately
 answer is yes it's possible to have a

0:30:26
Speaker 1 :physical address zero attacks in the
 physical world that are robust to this kind of viewing distance do angle and so

0:30:34
Speaker 0 :on right exactly so right so we actually
 created this adversary examples in the real world so like thisfor example stop sign so these are the
 stop signs that these are the tractor signs that have been put in the scienceof Museum in London
 [Laughter]

0:30:54
Speaker 1 :so what's what goes into the design of
 objects like that if you could just high level insights into the step fromdigital to the physical because that is
 a huge step from to trying to be robust to the different distances and viewing

0:31:14
Speaker 0 :angles and lighting conditions right
 exactly so create to create a successful adversary' example that actually worksin the physical world it's much more
 challenging than just in the digital world so first of all again in theteacher words if you just have an image
 then there's no you don't need to worry about this viewing distance and anglechanges and so on sort of one it's the
 environmental variation and also typically actually what you'll see whenpeople adds perturbation and to digital
 image to create this digital are three examples is that you can add theseperturbations anywhere in the image
 right but in our case we have a physical object a traffic sign that's posed inthe real world we can just add four
 divisions like a you know elsewhere like a we can add preservation outside of thetraffic sign it has to be on the traffic
 sign so there is a physical constraints where you can add perturbations and alsoso so we have the physical objects this
 a verse for example and then essentially there's a camera that will be takingpictures and then and feeding that to
 the to the running system so in the digital world you can have really smallperturbations because yeah editing the
 digital image directly and then feeding that directly to the learning system soeven really small perturbations it can
 cause a difference in impulse to the reigning system but in the physicalworld because you need a camera to
 actually take the take the picture as input and then feed it to the learningsystem we
 you have to make sure that the changes with the changes are perceptible enoughthat actually can cause difference from
 the camera size so we wanted to be small but still be the can cause a differenceafter the camera has taken the picture


0:33:11
Speaker 1 :right because you can't directly modify
 the picture that the camera sees like at

0:33:16
Speaker 0 :the point of the case so there's a
 physical sensory step yeah physical

0:33:20
Speaker 1 :sensing step that you're on the other


0:33:23
Speaker 0 :side of no right and also and also how
 do we actually change the physical object so essentially now we experimentwith did multiple different things so we
 can print out these stickers and put a sticker and then we actually bar thesereal words like stop signs and then we
 printed stickers and four stickers and them and so then in this case we alsohave to handle this printing stuff so
 again in the digital world you can't just it's just built you just changedthe in the color very whatever you can
 just change the pitch directly so you

0:33:58
Speaker 1 :

0:33:59
Speaker 0 :can try a lot of things too right right
 but in the physical worlds you have the you have the printer whatever attack youon the tool in the ends you have a
 printer that prints out these stickers are or would have a perturbation youwanted to another put it under and the
 object so we also essentially there's constraints what can be done there so soessentially there are many many of these
 additional constraints that you don't have in the digital world and then whenwe create the adversary example we have
 to take all these into consideration so

0:34:30
Speaker 1 :how much of the creation of the
 adversarial examples art and how much is science sort of how much is the sort oftrial and error trying to figure trying
 different things empirical sort of experiments and how much can be donesort of almost almost theoretically or
 or by looking at the model by looking at the neural network trying to I'm tryingto generate sort of definitively what
 the kind of stickers would be most likely to create to be a goodadversarial example in the physical


0:35:03
Speaker 0 :world right that's that's a very good
 question so essentially I would say it's mostlyscience in a sense that's
 we do have a no sign scientific way of computing what whatever sir example whatwhat is adversary perturbation we should
 add and then and of course in the ends because of these additional steps as Imention you have to print it out and
 then your you have to put it on and you have to take the camera and so there areadditional steps that you do need to do
 additional testing but the creation process of generating the a bursaryexample it's really a very like
 scientific approach essentially we it's just we isn't capture many of theseconstraints as we mentioned in this last
 function that's the way optimized for and so that's a very scientific so the

0:35:57
Speaker 1 :the fascinating fact that we can do
 these kinds of adversarial examples what do you think it shows us just yourthoughts in general what do you think it
 reveals to us about neural networks the fact that this is possible what do youthink it reveals thoughts about our
 machine learning approaches of today is there something interesting is that afeatures at a bug what do you what do


0:36:20
Speaker 0 :you think at a very early stage of
 really developing your busts and generalizable machine learning methodsand shows that way even though
 differently has made so much advancements but our understanding isvery limited we don't fully understand
 and we don't understand well how they work why they work and also we don'tunderstand that Wow right these buddies


0:36:53
Speaker 1 :ever sorry examples is some people have
 kind of written about the fact that that the fact that there were so exampleswork well is actually sort of a feature
 not a bug it's is that that actually they have learned really well to tellthe important differences between
 classes as represented by the training

0:37:13
Speaker 0 :set I think that's the other thing I was
 going to say so it shows us also that's the the deep learning systems and nowlearning the right things how do we make


0:37:21
Speaker 1 :them
 I mean I guess this might be a a place to ask about how do we then defend orhow do we either defend or make them
 more robust these adversarial examples

0:37:32
Speaker 0 :right I mean one thing is that I think
 other people so so they're happy actually thousands of papers now writtenon this topic Avenue of the attacks and
 mostly attacks I think they're more than then defenses but there are manyhundreds of defense papers as well so in
 defense's a lot of work has been trying to I would call it more like a patchworkfor example how to make the neural
 networks to LA three or four example like a master training how to make thema little bit more resilient got it um
 but I think in general it has limited effectiveness and we don't really havevery strong and general defense so part
 of that I think is we talked about in deep learning the goal is to learnrepresentations and that's our ultimate
 in Holy Grail ultimate goal is to learn representations but one thing I I thinkI have to say is that I think part of
 the lesson we're learning here is that we're one as I mentioned were notlearning the right things and you are
 now learning the right representations and also I think the representations weare learning is not rich enough and so
 so it's just like a human visions of course we don't fully understand howhuman visions work but while humans look
 at the world we don't just say oh you know this is a person there's a camerawhere she get much more nuanced
 information from the from the world and we use all this information together inthe ends to derive to help us to do
 motion planning and to do other things but also to classify what the object isand so on
 so we're linear much richer representation and I think that that'ssomething we have now figure out how to
 do in deep learning and I think the rhetoric transition will also help us tobuild a more generalizable
 more resilient running system can you

0:39:38
Speaker 1 :maybe linger on the idea of the word
 richer representations so to make representations more generalizable itseems like you want to make them more
 less sensitive to noise right so you

0:39:55
Speaker 0 :want to learn you want to learn the
 right things you don't want to for example learn this spurious correlationsand so on but at the same time is an
 example for return information our representation is like again we don'treally know how humans vision works but
 when we look at the visual world we actually we can identify contours we canidentify right much more information
 than just what's for example an image classification system is trying to doand that leads to I think the question
 you asked earlier about defenses so that's also in terms of more promisingdirections for defenses and that's where
 some of you know my work is trying to do and trying to show as well you have for

0:40:46
Speaker 1 :example in the year 2018 paper
 characterizing adversarial examples based on spatial consistency informationfor semantic segmentation so that's
 looking at some ideas on how to detect adversarial examples so like I get werethey you called them like a poisoned
 data set so like yeah adversarial bad examples in a segmentation day said canyou as an example for that paper can you


0:41:13
Speaker 0 :describe the process of defense there so
 in that paper what we look at is the semantic segmentation task so with thetask essentially given an image for each
 pixel you want to say what the label is for the pixel and so so just like whatwe talked about so for every example it
 can easily full image classification systems it turns out that it can alsovery easily for these segmentation
 systems as well so given image I essentially can add adversaryperturbation to the image to cause the
 class the segmentation system took basically segmented in any passion thatI wanted so sorry that people were also
 showed that you can segment it even though there's no kitty in the in theimage we can segment it into like a
 kitty pattern a Hello Kitty pattern yeah we segmented into like ICC v-tach sideshowing that this segmentation system
 even though they have fee effective in practice but at the same time they'rereasonably really easily fault so the
 question is how can we defend against is how we can do the more resilientsegmentation system so um so that's what
 we try to do and in particular what we are trying to do here is to actually tryto leverage some natural constraints in
 the task which we call in this case spatial consistency so the idea of thisspecial consistency is a following so
 again we'd already know how human vision works but in general was elicited whatwe can see us so for example as a person
 looks as the scene and we can segment the scene easily and then we humansright yes
 and then if heels pick like a two patches of the scene that has anintersection and for humans if your
 segments you know like patch a and patch B andthen you look at the segmentation
 results and especially if you look at the sacrament station results at theintersection of the two patches there
 should be consistent in the sense that's what the label know what the what thepixels in this intersection what their
 labels should be and they essentially from these two different patches thereshould be similar in the intersection
 mmm so that's what we call spatial consistency so similarly for asegmentation system they should have the
 same poverty right so in the in the image if you pick to randomly pick twopatches the has intersection
 you feed each patch to the segmentation system you get a results and then when Ilook at the results
 in the intersection the results the segmentation results should be very

0:44:16
Speaker 1 :similar is that so okay so logically
 that kind of makes sense at least it's a compelling notion but is that how welldoes that work is that does that hold


0:44:26
Speaker 0 :true for segmentation exactly so then in
 our where I can't experiment so we show the following so when we take secondnormal images this actually hosts pretty
 well for the segmentation systems that

0:44:41
Speaker 1 :way or like did you look at like driving


0:44:45
Speaker 0 :data sense right exactly but then this
 actually poses a challenge for a visceral examples because for theattacker to add perturbation to the
 image then it's easy for it to fold the segmentation system into for example fora particular patch are for the whole
 image to cause the segmentation system to create some to get to some wrongresults but it's it's actually very
 difficult for the attacker to to have this ever serial for the example tosatisfy the spatial consistency because
 these patches are randomly selected and they need to ensure that this specialconsistency works so they basically need
 to fall the segmentation system in a

0:45:33
Speaker 1 :very consistent way yeah without knowing
 the mechanism by which you're selecting the patches or so on exactly it has toreally fool the entirety of the so you


0:45:40
Speaker 0 :do that to actually to be really hard
 for the attacker to do we tries you know the first week in the city of the artattacks actually showed us this defense
 methods is actually very very effective and this goes to I think also what I'mmost saying earlier is essentially we
 want the learning system to have tools to have Richardson station also to learnfrom more you can add the same
 mathematics entually to have more ways to check whether it's actually havingthe right prediction so for example
 case doing the spacial consistency check and also actually so that's one paperthough it is and then this suspicion
 consider this notion of consistency check it's not just limited to spatialproperties it also applies to audio so
 we actually had follow-up work in audio to show that this temporal consistencycan also be very effective in detecting
 a verse for example seeing audio XP or what kind of data right and then andthen we can actually combine spatial
 consistency and temporal consistency to help us to develop more resilientmethods in video so to defend against
 attacks forbid you awesome that's fascinating yeah yes yes but in general

0:47:03
Speaker 1 :in the literature and the ideas are
 developing the attacks and the literature is developing a defense whowould you say is winning right now right


0:47:13
Speaker 0 :now of course is attack site it's much
 easier to develop attacks and there are so many different ways to developattacks even just us we develop so many
 different methods for for doing attacks and also you can do white box extractsyou can do black box attacks where
 attacks you don't even need and the attacker doesn't even need to know thearchitecture of the target system and
 now knowing the parameters after tacky system and another so there are so manydifferent types of attacks so the


0:47:46
Speaker 1 :counter-argument that people would have
 like people that are using machine learning and companies they would saysure and constrained environments and
 very specific data set when you know a lot about the model you know a lot aboutthe data set already you'll be able to
 do this attack is very nice it makes for a nice demo it's a very interesting ideabut my system won't be able to be
 attacked like this so the real-world systems won't be able to be attackedlike this that's like that's that's
 another hope there's actually a lot harder to attack real-world systems canyou talk to that is it I how hard is it
 to attack real-world systems yes I

0:48:24
Speaker 0 :wouldn't call that I hope I think yeah
 it's more alpha wishful thinking I try trying to be lucky and so actually inour recent work my students and
 collaborators has shown some very effective attacks on real-world systemsfor example Google Translate and
 translation api's so in this work we showed so far I talked about otherexamples mostly in the vision category
 and of course adversary' examples also work in other domains as well forexample in natural language so so in
 this work my students and collaborators have shown that also one we can actuallyvery easily steal the model from for
 example Google Translate but just two inquiries from right through the api'sand then we can train an imitation model
 ourselves using the curries and then once we and also the imitation model canbe very very effective and essentially
 have achieving similar performance as a target model and then once we have theimitation model we can then try to
 create adversarial examples on these imitation models so for example andgiving a you know in a work here was one
 example is translating from English to German we can give it a sentence sayingfor example I'm feeling freezing it's
 like 6 Fahrenheit and then translating German and then we can actually generateadversary examples that creates a target
 translation by very small perturbation so in this case I say we want to changethe translation itself and six
 Fahrenheit to 21 Southeast's and in this particular example actually which haschanged 6 to 7 in the original sentence
 that's the only change we made it caused the translation to changefrom the six Fahrenheit into 21 that's
 terrible and then and then so this example we created this example from ourimitation model imitation and then this
 work actually transfers to the Google

0:50:58
Speaker 1 :Translate so the attacks that work on
 the imitation model in some cases at least transfer to the original rightmodel that's incredible and terrifying
 okay that's amazing work and that shows

0:51:09
Speaker 0 :us again real world systems actually can
 be easily fooled and in our previous work we also showed these type of blackbox attacks can be effective cloud to
 the vision API as well so that's for

0:51:23
Speaker 1 :natural language and for vision let's
 let's talk about another space that people have some concern about which isautonomous driving is sort of security
 concerns that's another real world

0:51:37
Speaker 0 :

0:51:38
Speaker 1 :system so do you have should people be
 worried about adversarial machine learning attacks in the context ofautonomous vehicles that use like Tesla
 autopilot for example they uses vision as a primary sensor for perceiving theworld and navigating in that world what
 do you think from your stop sign work in the physical world should people beworried how hard is that attack so


0:52:02
Speaker 0 :actually there has already been like
 that there have always been and like a research shown that's for exampleactually even with Tesla like if you put
 a few stickers on the road it can't actually wide range in certain ways itcan for that that's right but I don't


0:52:20
Speaker 1 :think it's actually been I'm not I might
 not be familiar but I don't think it's been done on physical world's physicalroads yet meaning I think is with the
 projector in front of the Tesla so it's a it's a physical suppose you're on theother side of the side of the sensor but
 you're not in still the physical world the the question is whether it'spossible to orchestrate attacks that
 work in the actual physical like end-to-end attacks like not just ademonstration of the concept but
 thinking is it possible on the highway to control a Tesla

0:52:54
Speaker 0 :that kind of idea I think there are two
 separate questions one is the feasibility of the attack and I'mhundred percent confident that's the is
 possible and there's a separate question whether you know someone will actuallygo you know deploy that attack I I hope
 people do not do that yeah two separate questions

0:53:16
Speaker 1 :so the question on the word feasibility
 the clarified feasibility means it's possible it doesn't say how hard it isbecause in there to implement it so sort
 of the the barrier like how how much of a heist it has to be like how manypeople have to be involved what is the
 probability of success that kind of stuff and coupled with how many evilpeople there are in the world that would
 attempt such an attack right that but the to my question is is it sort of atyou know I talked to you a mosque and a
 same question he says it's not a problem it's very difficult to do in the realworld that this won't be a problem he
 dismissed it as a problem for adversarial attacks on the Tesla ofcourse he happens to be involved with
 the company so he has to say that but I mean they may linger and a little longer

0:54:09
Speaker 0 :do you see you where does your


0:54:11
Speaker 1 :confidence that it's feasible come from
 and what's your intuition how people should be worried and how we might be dohow people should defend against it how
 Tesla how way Moe how other autonomous legal companies should defend againstsensory based attacks on whether on
 lidar or on vision or so on

0:54:32
Speaker 0 :and also even for light actually that
 has been researched shown even like it's

0:54:39
Speaker 1 :really important to pause there's really
 nice demonstrations that it's possible to do but there are so many pieces thatit's kind of like it's it's kind of in
 the lab now it's in the physical world meaning it's in the physical space theattacks but it's very like you have to
 control a lot of things to pull it off it's like the difference between openinga safe when you have it and you have
 unlimited time and you can work on it like breaking into like the crownstealing the crown jewels or whatever


0:55:14
Speaker 0 :right in terms of how real these attacks
 can be one way to look at it is that actually you don't even need anysophisticated attacks already we have
 seen in the many real-world examples incidents where showing that the thevehicle was making the wrong decision


0:55:34
Speaker 1 :

0:55:36
Speaker 0 :wrong decision without attacks right and
 this is also like so far with many talks about work in this adversarial settingshowing that today's learning system
 they are so vulnerable to the adversarial setting but at the same timeactually we also know that even in
 natural settings these learning systems they don't generalize well and hencethey can really misbehave and there's
 certain situations like what we have seen and hence I think using that as anexample okay so you should can be really


0:56:07
Speaker 1 :they can be real but so there's two
 cases one is something it's like perturbations can make the system isbehaved versus make the system do one
 specific thing that the attacker wants as you said targeted that seems you know

0:56:23
Speaker 0 :

0:56:23
Speaker 1 :that seems to be very difficult like a
 extra level of difficult step in the in the real world but from the perspectiveof the passenger of the car here I don't
 think it matters either way whether it's yeah it's misbehavior or a targeted

0:56:42
Speaker 0 :attack okay and also and that's why I
 was also saying earlier like if one defense is this multi modal defense andmore of these consistent checks and so
 on so in the future I think also it's important that for these autonomousvehicles the right they have lots of
 different sensors and they should be combining all these sensory readings toarrive at the decision and the
 interpretation of the world and so on and the more of these sensory inputsthey use and the better they combine the
 sensory inputs the heart rate is going to be attacked and hence I think that isa very important direction for us to
 move towards so more

0:57:21
Speaker 1 :Damona multi-sensor across multiple
 cameras but also in the case car radar ultrasonic sound even so all of those

0:57:31
Speaker 0 :rights right exactly


0:57:33
Speaker 1 :so another thing another part of your
 work has been in the space of privacy and that too can be seen as a kind ofsecurity vulnerability as social
 thinking of data as a thing that should be protected and the vulnerabilities todata is vulnerability is essentially the
 thing that you want to protect is the privacy of that data so what do you seeas the main vulnerabilities in the
 privacy of data and how do we protect it

0:58:02
Speaker 0 :right so you see in security we actually
 talk about essentially two in this case two different properties one isintegrity and one is confidentiality so
 what we have been talking earlier is essentially the integrity of theintegrity property after the new system
 how to make sure that the new system is giving the right prediction for exampleand privacy centuries on the other side
 is about confidentiality of the system is how attackers can when the attackeris compromise the confidentiality of the
 system that's when the attacker is still sensitive information and right aboutindividuals and so on it's really clean


0:58:48
Speaker 1 :does it
 those are great terms integrity and confidentiality right so how what arethe main vulnerabilities to privacy
 would you say and how do we protect against it like what what are the mainspaces and problems that you think about


0:59:06
Speaker 0 :in the context of privacy right so and
 especially in the machine learning setting and so in this case as we knowthat how the process goes is that we
 have the training data and then the machining system a-train's from thescreening data and then buta model and
 then they say our inputs are given to the model to inference time to try toget prediction and so on so then in this
 case the privacy concerns that we have istypically about privacy of the data in
 the training data because that's essentially the private information soand it's really important because
 oftentimes the training data can be very sensitive it can be your financial datahow data are like in our case it's the
 sensors deployed in real world environments and so on and all this canbe collecting very sensitive information
 and other sensitive information gets the first into the new system and trains andas we know these neural networks they
 can have really high capacity and they actually can remember a lot and hencejust from the learning the learned model
 in the end actually attackers can potentially infra information abouttheir original training data set so the


1:00:37
Speaker 1 :thing you're trying to protect yeah is
 the confidentiality of the training data and so what are the methods for doingthat would you say what what are the
 different ways that can be done and also

1:00:47
Speaker 0 :we can talk about essentially how they
 attackin may try to relay information from the right so so and also there aredifferent types of attacks so in certain
 cases again like in white box attacks we can say that the attacker I should getto see the parameters of the model and
 then from that the a smile attacker potential you can try to figure outinformation about the training data sets
 they can try to figure out what type of theta has been in the training data setsand sometimes they can tell like whether
 a person has been a particular person's data point has been used in the training

1:01:28
Speaker 1 :data sets so white box meaning you have
 access to the parameters are saying your network and so that you're saying thatit's some given that information as
 possible to some so I can give you some

1:01:38
Speaker 0 :examples and another type of attack
 which is even easier to carry out is now the web box model is more offer just aquery model where the
 hacker only gets to carry the machine in your model and then try to stealsensitive information in the original
 training data so right so I can give you an example in this case training alanguage model so in now I work in
 collaboration with the researchers from Google we actually studied the followingquestion so so however the question is
 as we mentioned the neural networks can have very high capacity and they couldbe remembering a lot from the training
 process then the question is can attacker actually exploit this and tryto actually extract sensitive
 information in the original training dataset through just securing thelearned model without even knowing the
 parameters of the model like the details of the model are the actual model aftermodel and so on so so that's the that's
 the question we set how to exploit and in one of the case studies we showed thefollowing so we trained the language
 model over an email data sets it's called an Enron email data sets and eraemail datasets naturally contains uses
 social security numbers and credit card numbers so we treat the language modelover the city cells and then we showed
 that an attacker by devising some new attacks by just occurring the languagemodel and without knowing the details of
 the model the attacker actually can extract the original social securitynumbers and credit card numbers that
 were in the original training so get the

1:03:29
Speaker 1 :most sensitive personally identifiable
 information from the dataset I'm just

1:03:36
Speaker 0 :worrying it that's why even as we trie
 machine mania models we have to be really careful with the protecting usersdata promise me so what are the


1:03:51
Speaker 1 :mechanisms for protecting is there as
 their as their hopeful so if there's been recent work or non-differentialprivacy for example that that that
 provides some hope but

1:04:03
Speaker 0 :describe some of these that's actually
 right so that's also our finding is that by actually we show that in thisparticular case we actually have a good


1:04:14
Speaker 1 :defense for the Quarian case for the


1:04:15
Speaker 0 :coin it's a language model language
 model k so instead of just training a vanilla language model instead if wetrain a differentially private language
 model then we can still achieve similar utility but at the same time we canactually significantly enhance the
 privacy protection and stay after learned model and our proposed attacksactually are no longer effective and


1:04:44
Speaker 1 :differential privacy is the mechanism of
 adding some noise by which you then have some guarantees on the inability tofigure out the the person the the
 presence of a human of a particular person in the data set so right so in

1:04:59
Speaker 0 :this particular case what the
 differential privacy mechanism does is that it actually as participation in thetraining process as we know during the
 training process we are learning the model well doing gradient updates theway the updates and so on and
 essentially differential privacy differentially privatesmachining algorithm in this case we'll
 be adding noise and a diverse perturbation during this training to

1:05:33
Speaker 1 :some aspect of the training process


1:05:36
Speaker 0 :right so then the finely trained ruining
 the learned model is differentially privates and so I can put can enhance

1:05:46
Speaker 1 :the privacy protection so okay so that's
 the attacks and the defense of privacy you also talked about ownership of dataso this this is a really interesting
 idea that we get to use many services online for seemingly for free byessentially sort of a lot of companies
 are funded through advertisement and what that means is the advertisementworks exceptionally well because the
 companies are able to access our personal data so they know whichadvertisement to service
 to do targeted advertisements so on so can you maybe talk about the this youhave some nice paintings of the future
 philosophically speaking future where people can have a little bit morecontrol of their data by owning and
 maybe understanding the value of their data and being able to sort of monetizeit in a more explicit way as opposed to
 the implicit way that is currently done

1:06:44
Speaker 0 :yeah I think this is a fascinating topic
 and also a really complex topic right I think there are these natural questionswho should be owning the data and and so
 I can tell one analogy and so for example for physical properties likeyour house and so on so really um this
 notion of property rights it's not just you know like it's not like from day onewe knew that's there should be like this
 clear notion of ownership of properties and having enforcement for this and soactually people have shown that this
 establishment and enforcement of property rights has been a main driverfor the for the for the economy earlier
 and that actually really propelled the economic growth and even right in the

1:07:51
Speaker 1 :earlier stage so throughout the history
 of the development of the United States there or actually just civilization theidea of property rights that you can own


1:08:00
Speaker 0 :property enforcement days is you should
 know rights like governmental like enforcement of this actually has been akey driver for economic growth and there
 have been even research proposals saying that for a lot of the developingcountries and they you know essentially
 the challenging growth is not actually due to the lack of capital itsmore due to the lack of this problem
 notion property rights and enforcement's

1:08:37
Speaker 1 :of property rights interesting so that
 the presence of absence of both the the the concept of the property rights andtheir enforcement has a strong
 correlation to economic growth and so you think that that same could betransferred to the idea of property
 ownership in case of data ownership I

1:08:57
Speaker 0 :think I think its first of all it's a
 good lesson for us to like to recognize that these rights and the recognitionand enforcement of this type of Rights
 it's very very important for economic growth and then if we look at where weare now and where we are going in the
 future and so essentially more and more as it's actually moving into the digitalworld and also more anymore I would say
 even like information our asset alpha person is more and more into the realworld the physical necessary the
 teaching the world as well it's the data that's the presence generators andessentially it's like in the past what
 defines a person you you can say right like oftentimes besides the inmates likecapabilities actually it's the physical
 properties oh right that you finds a person but I think more the more peoplestart to realize actually what defines a
 person is more important in the data that the person has generated other dataabout the person all the way from your
 political views yar yar music tastes and right your financial information now alot of these and your health so more and
 more of the definition of the person is actually in the digital world and

1:10:22
Speaker 1 :currently for the most part that's owned
 in place like it's and people don't talk about it but kind of it's owned by[Music]
 Internet companies so it's not owned by

1:10:34
Speaker 0 :individual there's no clear notion of
 ownership after such data and also we you know we talk about privacy and so onbut I think
 actually clearly identifying the ownership it's a first step once youidentify the ownership then you can say
 who gets to define how that either should be used so maybe some users arefine with you know internet companies
 serving them as you think the data as lies if the if the data is used in acertain way that actually the user
 consents ways are allowed for example you can see the recommendation system insome sense we don't call it an ass but a
 recommendation system similar it's trying to recommend you something andusers enjoy and can really benefit from
 good recommendation systems and they recommend you you're better music moviesnews or even research papers to read but
 but of course then in this tech is ass especially in in certain cases wherepeople can be manipulated by this
 targeted ass that can have really bad like a severe consequences so soessentially uses one that data to be
 used to better serve them and also maybe even right get pay for whatever like indifferent settings but the things that's
 the first of all we need to really establish like you who needs to decidewho can decide how the data should be
 used and typically that the establishment and clarification of theownership will help this and it's an
 important first step so if the user is the owner then naturally the user getsto define how the dinner should be used
 but if you even say that wait a minute you say actually now theowner of the stator whoever's collecting
 the data is the owner of the data now of course they get to use it in a hybridway they want yeah so to really address
 these complex issues we need to go at the root cause so it seems fairly clearthat's the first we really need to say
 now who is the owner of the data and then the owners can specify how the onethat they'd had to be utilized so I said


1:12:47
Speaker 1 :that that's a fascinating does most
 people don't think about that and I think that's a fascinating thing tothink about and probably fight for it
 I can only see in the economic growth argument it's probably a really strongone so that's that's the first time I'm
 kind of at least thinking about the the positive aspect of that ownership beingthe long-term growth of the economy so
 good for everybody but sort of one down possible downside I could see sort of toput on my grumpy old grandpa hat and you
 know it's really nice for Facebook and YouTube and Twitter to all be free andif you give control to people or their
 data do you think it's possible they will be they would not want to hand itover quite easily and so a lot of these
 companies that rely on mass handover of data and then their book thereforeprovide a mass seemingly free service
 would then completely so the the the the way the internet looks will completelychange because of the ownership of data
 and we'll lose a lot of services with value do you worry about that that's a

1:14:01
Speaker 0 :very good question I think that's not
 necessarily the case in a sense that's yes users can have ownership of theirdata they can maintain control of their
 data but also then they get to decide how their data can be used so and that'swhy I mention it like you see in this
 case if they feel that they enjoy the benefits of social networks and so onand they are fine with having Facebook
 having their data but utilizing the data in certain way that's they agree thenthey can still enjoy the free services
 but for others maybe they would prefer some kind of private vision and in thatcase maybe they can even opt in to say
 that I want to pay and to have so for example it's already fairly standardlike you pay for certain subscriptions
 so that you don't get to you know be shown as yes yeah right so the usersessentially can have choices and I think
 we just want to essentially bring out more about who gets to decidewhat to do with that yeah I think it's


1:15:11
Speaker 1 :an interesting idea because if you pull
 people now you know it seems like I don't know but subjectively sort ofanecdotally speaking it seems like a lot
 of people don't trust Facebook so that's at least a very popular thing to saythat I don't trust Facebook right I
 wonder if you give people control of their data as opposed to sort ofsignaling to everyone that they don't
 trust Facebook I wonder how they would speak with the actual like would they bewilling to pay $10 a month for Facebook
 or would they hand over their data it'd be interesting to see what fractionof people with would quietly hand over
 their data to Facebook to make it free III don't have a good intuition aboutthat like how many people do you have an
 intuition about how many people would use their data effectively on the marketon the on the market of the Internet by
 sort of buying services with their data

1:16:10
Speaker 0 :yeah so that's a very good question I
 think so one thing I also want to mention is that this right so it seemsthat especially in press and the
 conversation has been very much like two sides fighting against each other um ohone hands right yes your skin say that
 right they don't trust Facebook they don't are there is DB Facebook yeah yeahexactly
 on the other hand and right of course and right the other side they also feeloh they are providing a lot of services
 to users and users are getting it all for free so I think actually you know Italked a lot to like different companies
 and also like a physically ample size and so one thing I hope also like thismy hope for this year also is that and
 we want to establish a more constructive dialogue and that happen and to helppeople to understand that the problem is
 much more nuanced then just and this to size fightingbecause naturally there's a tension
 between the two sides between your Twitter and privacy so if you want toget more utility essentially like the
 recommendation system example I gave earlier if you want someone to give yougood recommendation
 essentially whatever the system is the system is going to need to know yourdata to give you a good recommendation
 but also of course at the same time we want to ensure that however that data isbeing handled it's done in the privacy
 preserving way and so that that for example that recommendation systemdoesn't just go around and say we are
 they here and then cause all the you know cause a lot of bad consequences andso on so you want that dialog to be a


1:18:13
Speaker 1 :little bit more in the open a little
 more more nuanced and maybe adding control to the data ownership to thedata will allow so as opposed to this
 happening in the background allowed to bring it to the forefront and actuallyhave dialogues in like more nuanced real
 dialogues about how we trade our data for the services that's the whole rights

1:18:38
Speaker 0 :right yes at high level so essentially
 also knowing that there are technical challenges and in in addressing theissue to like you basically you can't
 have just like the example that I gave earlier it is really difficult tobalance the two between utility and
 privacy and and that's also a lot of things that I work on my group Roxanneas well as to actually develop these
 technologies that are needed to essentially help this balance betteressentially to help data to be utilized
 in the privacy preserving and responsible way and so we essentiallyneed people to understand the challenges
 and also at the same time and to provide the technical abilities and alsoregulatory frameworks to help the two
 sites will be more in the women situation instead of

1:19:36
Speaker 1 :I fight yeah the fighting the fighting
 thing is I think YouTube and Twitter and Facebook are providing an incredibleservice to the world and they're all
 making mistakes of course but they're doing an incredible job you know that Ithink deserves to be applauded and
 there's some degree of gratit it's a cool thing that the that's created andit shouldn't be monolithically fought
 against like Facebook as evil or so on yeah I might make mistakes but I thinkit's an incredible service I think it's
 world-changing I mean I've you know I think Facebook's done a lot ofincredible incredible things by bringing
 for example identity you're like allowing people to be themselves liketheir real selves in in the digital
 space by using a real name and their real picture that step was like thefirst step from the real world to the
 digital world that was a huge step that perhaps will define the 21st century inus creating a digital identity there's a
 lot of interesting possibilities there that are positive of course some thingsare negative and having a good dialogue
 about that is great and I'm I'm great that people like you're at the centerthat's how access is it's awesome I


1:20:53
Speaker 0 :think it also and I also can understand
 I think actually in the past especially in the past couple years and this risingawareness has been helpful like users
 are also more and more recognizing that privacy is important to themthey shoes may be right there should be
 owners after data I think the Stephanus is very helpful and I think also thistype of voice also and together with the
 regulatory framework and so on also help the companies to essentially put thistype of issues at a higher priority and
 knowing that right also it is their responsibility to to ensure that usersare well protected and so I think it
 definitely the raising voice is super helpful and I think that I shouldreally has brought the issue of data
 privacy and even this consideration of the ownership to the forefront to reallymuch by the community and I think more
 of this voice is needed but I think it's just that we want to have a moreconstructive dialogue to bring the both
 sides together to figure out a constructive solution so another

1:22:14
Speaker 1 :interesting space where security is
 really important is in in the space of any kinds of transactions but it couldbe also digital currency so can you
 maybe talk a little bit about blockchain and can you tell me what is a blockchain

1:22:31
Speaker 0 :I think the brought to you where it
 itself is activated overload is in general it's like AI yesso in general I talk about our team we
 refer to this distributed IJ in a decentralized fashion so essentially youhave in a community of nose that come
 together and even though each one may not be trusted and otherwise certainthresholds of the set of nodes and he
 behaves properly then and the system can essentially achieve certain propertiesfor example in the distributed I just I
 think you have you can maintain a mutable log and you can ensure that forsome of the transactions actually I'll
 create a pound and then it's immutable and so on so first of all what's the

1:23:28
Speaker 1 :

1:23:30
Speaker 0 :ledger so it's a it's like a database
 it's like a data entry and so

1:23:34
Speaker 1 :distributed ledger is something that's
 maintained across or is synchronized across multiple sources multiple nodes

1:23:42
Speaker 0 :multiple notes yes and so where is this


1:23:43
Speaker 1 :idea now how do you keep okay so it's
 important ledger a database to keep that to make sure so what are the kinds ofsecurity vulnerabilities that you're
 trying to protect against in the context of thisthe distributed ledger so in this case


1:24:04
Speaker 0 :for example you don't want to some
 malicious nose to be able to change the transaction logs and in certain casesaccount double spending like your also
 calls you can also cause different views in different parts of the network and so

1:24:22
Speaker 1 :on so the ledger has to represent if
 you're capturing like financial transactions has to represent the exacttiming and the exact occurrence and no
 duplicates all that kind of stuff has to be represent what actually happened okayso what are your thoughts on the
 security and privacy of digital currency I can't tell you how many people writeto me to interview various people in the
 digital currency space there seems to be a lot of excitement there and it seemsto be some of it to me from an
 outsider's perspective seems like dark magicI don't know how secure I think the the
 foundation from my perspective of digital currencies that is you can'ttrust anyone so you have to create a
 really secure system so can you maybe speak about how well your thoughts ingeneral about digital currency is and
 how you how it can possibly create financial transactions and financialstores of money in the digital space


1:25:32
Speaker 0 :so you as security and privacy and so so
 again as I mentioned earlier in security we actually talk about two mainproperties and the integrity and
 confidentiality and so there's another one for availability you want the systemto be available but here for the
 question you ask let's just focus on integrity and confidentiality yes so sofor integrity of this distribution
 essentially as we discussed we want to ensure that's the different nose andright so they have this consistent video
 usually it's down through we call a consensus protocol and that's theestablish
 share the view on this leche and that you cannot go back and change thisimmutable and so on so so in this case
 then the security often refers to this integrity property and essentiallyyou're asking the question how much work
 how how can you attack the system so that the attacker can change the lockfor example right how hard is it to make


1:26:46
Speaker 1 :an attack like that yes right and then


1:26:49
Speaker 0 :that very much depends on the the
 consensus mechanism the how the system is built and now that so there aredifferent ways to build these
 decentralized systems and people may have heard about the term Scout likeproof-of-work you prefer take you this
 different mechanisms and really depends on how how the system has been built andalso how much resources how much work
 has gone into the network to actually say how secure it is so for example ifyou talk about like in the coins for
 what system is so much electricity it has been burnt

1:27:32
Speaker 1 :so there's differences there's
 differences in the different mechanisms and the implementations of a distributedledger used for digital currency also
 there's Bitcoin is a whatever there's so many of them and there's underlyingdifferent mechanisms and there's
 arguments I suppose about which is more effective which is more secure which is

1:27:52
Speaker 0 :more what amount of resources needed to
 be able to attack the system like for example what percentage of the nose doyou need to control our compromise in
 order to write to change the log and

1:28:10
Speaker 1 :those are things do you do you have a
 sense if those are things that can be shown theoretically through the designof the mechanisms or does it have to be
 shown empirically by having a large number of users using the currency I see

1:28:23
Speaker 0 :so in general for each consensus
 mechanism you can actually show theoretically what is needed to be ableto attack the system of course there are
 there can be different types of attacks as weepy and discuss at the beginningand so that and it's difficult to gave
 like you know a complete estimate like really how much is needed to compromisethe system but in general right so there
 are ways to say what percentage of the knows you need to compromise and so on

1:29:03
Speaker 1 :so we talked about integrity so on the
 security side and then you also mentioned can the privacy or theconfidentiality side does it have some
 of does it have some of the same problems and therefore some of the samesolutions that you talked about and the
 machine learning side with differential privacy and so on yeah so actually in

1:29:23
Speaker 0 :general on the public ledger in this
 public decentralized systems and actually nothing is private so all thetransactions posters on the library
 anybody can see so in that sense there is no confidentiality and so usually allyou can do is then there are the
 mechanisms that you can built in to enable confidentiality are privacy ofthe transactions and the data and so on
 that's also some of the work and that's both my group and also my startup anddoes as well what's the name you start o


1:30:06
Speaker 1 :Asus labs Oasis labs and so the
 confidentiality aspect there is even though the transactions are public youwant to keep some aspect confidential of
 the identity of the people involved in the transactions or what what is theirhope to keep confidential in this


1:30:25
Speaker 0 :context so in this case for example you
 want to your nipple like private confidential transactions even so sothere are different and essentially
 types of data that you want to keep private are confidential and you canutilize different technologies
 including your knowledge proofs and also secure computing and techniques and tohide the right who is making the
 transactions to whom and the transaction amount and in our case also we canenable like confidential smart contracts
 and so that's you don't know the data and the execution of the smart contractand so on and we actually are combining
 these different technologies and to going back to the earlier discussion wehad enabling like ownership of data and
 privacy of data and so on so so at Oasis labs we're actually building what wecall a platform for responsible data
 economy to actually combine these different technologies together and toenable secure and privacy-preserving
 computation and also using the library to help provide immutable log of usersownership to their data and the policies
 they want the data to adhere to the usage of the data to adhere to and alsohow that it has been utilized so all
 this together can build we can a distributed secure computing fabric thathelps to enable a more responsible data
 economy other things together yeah wow

1:32:13
Speaker 1 :those eloquent okay you're involved in
 so much amazing work that we'll never be able to get to but I have to ask atleast briefly about program synthesis
 which at least in a philosophical sense captures much of the dreams of what'spossible in computer science and the
 artificial intelligence first let me ask what is program synthesis and can uralnetworks be used to learn programs from
 data so can this be learned some aspect of this synthesis can it be learned so

1:32:47
Speaker 0 :program synthesis is about teaching
 computers to write code to program and I think it has one of our ultimatedreams or goals and you know I think
 Andreessen talked about software eating the world so I say once we teachcomputers to write software
 I had to write programs then I guess computers yeah exactly so yeah and alsofor me actually
 um when I you know shifted from security to more AI a machining program synthesisis program scenes in adversarial
 machining these are the two fields that I particularly focus on like programsynthesis one of the first questions
 that I actually started what are seeking

1:33:42
Speaker 1 :just as a question oh I guess with from
 the security side there's a you know you're looking for holes and programs soas at least see small connection but why
 what was your interest for program synthesis as because it's such afascinating such a big such a hard
 problem in the general case why program synthesis so the reason for that is

1:34:03
Speaker 0 :actually when I shifted my focus from
 security into AI machine learning and actually one of my main motivation atthe time and is that even though I have
 been doing a lot of working security and privacy but I have always beenfascinated about beauty intelligent
 machines and that was really my main motivation to spend more time in AI am aShalini is as I really want to figure
 out how we can build intelligent machines and to help us towards thatgoal program synthesis is really one
 enough I would say the best domain to work on I actually call it's likeprogramming synthesis it's like the
 perfect playground for building intelligent machines thereforeartificial general intelligence yeah um


1:35:01
Speaker 1 :well it's also in that sense not just a
 playground I guess it's it's the ultimate test of intelligence becauseyes I think I think
 you can generate so neural networks can learn good functions and they can helpy'all in classification tasks but to be
 able to write programs right that's that's the epitome from the machine sidethat's the same as passing the Turing
 test and natural language but with programs it's able to expresscomplicated ideas to reason through
 ideas and yeah and boil them down to

1:35:38
Speaker 0 :algorithms yes exactly is that credible


1:35:40
Speaker 1 :so can this be learned how far are we
 is there hope what are the open

1:35:46
Speaker 0 :challenges questions and we're still at
 an early stage but already I think you we have seen a lot of progress I meandefinitely we have you know existence
 proof just like the humans can write programs so there's no reason whycomputers cannot write programs and so I
 think that's definitely an achievable goal it's just how long it takes andthen and even today we actually have you
 know the program synthesis community especially the program synthesis bylearning our way College neural program
 synthesis community is still very small but the community has been growing andwe have seen a lot of progress and in
 limited domains I think actually program synthesis is ripe for real-worldapplications so actually was kind of
 amazing I was at giving a talk it's also here it's a rework we worked youplanning something actually so I give
 another talk at the previously rework conference in deep reinforcementlearning and then I actually met someone
 from a startup and the CEO of the startup and when he saw my name herecognized and he actually said one of
 our papers actually had they have put the had actually become a key productsand that was program synthesis in that
 particular case it was natural language translation translatingnatural language description into psycho


1:37:32
Speaker 1 :Cory's oh wow that that direction


1:37:35
Speaker 0 :okay right so yeah so you program since
 this is in limited domains in well specified domains actually already wecan see really great great progress and
 applicability in the real roads so

1:37:52
Speaker 1 :domains like as an example you said
 natural language being able to express something to just normal language and itconverts it into a database sequel SQL
 query right and that's how how solve the problem is that because that seems likea really hard problem okay eliminate


1:38:10
Speaker 0 :domains actually it can work pretty well
 and now this is also a very active domain after research at the time Ithink one he saw our paper at the time
 we were the state of the Arts yeah and that task and since then actually nowthere has been more work and with even
 more sophisticated assets and so but I I think I wouldn't be surprised that'smore of this type of technology really
 getting to the real worlds that's exciting in the near term being able to

1:38:45
Speaker 1 :learn in the space of programs is super
 exciting I still yeah I'm still skeptical because I think it's a reallyhard problem progress and also I think


1:38:56
Speaker 0 :in terms of the your ass about open
 challenges I think the domain is full of challenges and in particular also wewant to see how we should measure the
 progress in the space and I would say mainly three main I'll say metrics soone is a complexity of the program that
 we can synthesize and that will actually have clear measures and just look at youknow the past publications and even like
 for example I was at the recent Europe's conference now there is actually verysizable like session dedicated to
 program since this is vicious or even

1:39:36
Speaker 1 :neural progress today


1:39:37
Speaker 0 :which is great and and we continue to
 see the increase like I think they were

1:39:49
Speaker 1 :sizable it's five people and they will


1:39:51
Speaker 0 :

1:39:55
Speaker 1 :all win touring awards one day like it


1:39:57
Speaker 0 :so we can see increase in the complexity
 of the program is that these synthesized

1:40:09
Speaker 1 :sorry - is it the complexity of the
 actual text of the program or the running time complexity which complexity

1:40:16
Speaker 0 :over how complexity after task to be
 synthesized and the complexes are after the actual synthesize the programs soyou so the lines of code even for


1:40:28
Speaker 1 :example okay I got you but it's not the
 theoretical upper bound of the running

1:40:34
Speaker 0 :time of the day and you can see the


1:40:36
Speaker 1 :complexity in decreasing already oh no


1:40:39
Speaker 0 :meaning we want to be able to synthesize
 monomer complex programs bigger and bigger programs so we want to see that'swe want to increase I have to think


1:40:50
Speaker 1 :through because I thought of complexity
 is you want to be able to accomplish the same task with a simpler and simplerprogram no we are not doing that okay


1:40:57
Speaker 0 :it's more it's more about how complex a
 task right we can see the exotic being

1:41:03
Speaker 1 :able to synthesize programs learn them
 for more and more difficult right so for

1:41:10
Speaker 0 :example initially our first working
 program synthesis synthesis was to translate natural language descriptioninto really simple programs called
 if TTT if this then that so given a trigger condition what is the action youshould take so that program is a super
 simple you just Andy identify the trigger conditions and the action yeahand then later on with the secret
 queries that gets more complex and then also we started to synthesize programswith loops and know anything could


1:41:41
Speaker 1 :synthesize recursion it's all over


1:41:45
Speaker 0 :actually yeah 1fi works actually it's
 already rechristen you're complexity and the other one isgeneralization like one-way training I
 want to learn programming synthesizer in this case and neural programs tosynthesize programs then you wanted to
 generalize so for a large number of

1:42:10
Speaker 1 :inputs to be able to write generalize to


1:42:13
Speaker 0 :previously and C inputs got it and so so
 someone for the work who waited earlier learning recursive new programs actuallyshowed that recursion actually is
 important and to learn and if you have recursion then for certain and set oftasks we can actually show that you can
 actually have perfect generalization and so right so that one the best paperAwards that I clear earlier and so
 that's one example of we want to learn these you know programs that cangeneralize better but that works for a
 certain task with certain domains and there is question how we can essentiallydevelop more techniques that can and
 have generalization for wider set of domains and so on so that's another areaand then and then the the third
 challenge I think will it's not just for programming synthesis is also cuttingacross other fields in machine learning
 and also including like deep reinforcement and in particular is thatthis adaptation is that we want to be
 able to learn from the past and tasks and training and so on to be able tosolve new tasks so for example in
 program synthesis today we still are working in the setting way given aparticular task we change the right
 model and to solve this particular task but that's not how humans work like thewhole point is we train a human than
 you can then program to south new tasks right exactly and just like we don'twant to just change agent to play a
 particular game hey it's Atari ice ago whatever we wantto train these agents that can and
 essentially extract knowledge from the past learning experience to be able toadapt to new new tasks and solve new
 tasks and I think this is particularly important for program synthesis yeahthat's the whole point that's the whole


1:44:35
Speaker 1 :dream of progress this is your learning
 a tool that can solve new problems right

1:44:41
Speaker 0 :exactly and I think that's a particular
 main that as a community we need to put more emphasis on and I hope that we canmake more progress today as well


1:44:54
Speaker 1 :awesome I think there's a lot more to
 talk about but let me ask that you also had a very interesting and we talkedabout rich representations he had a rich
 life journey you did your bachelor's in China and your masters and PhD in theUnited States CMU and Berkeley are there
 interesting differences I told you I'm Russian I think there's a lot ofinteresting difference between Russia
 and the United States are there in your eyes interesting differences between thetwo cultures from the silly romantic
 notion of the spirit of the people to the more practical notion of howresearch is conducted that you find
 interesting or useful in your own work of having experienced both that's a good

1:45:41
Speaker 0 :question I think so I I started in China
 for my undergraduate and that was more than 20 years ago there's been a longtime


1:45:58
Speaker 1 :

1:45:58
Speaker 0 :is there echoes of that time I think
 even more so maybe something that's even be more different for my experience anda lot of computer science researchers
 and practitioners is that so for my undergraduate studies physicsvery nice and then I switch to a
 computer science in graduate school what

1:46:21
Speaker 1 :

1:46:24
Speaker 0 :happened was there was there is there


1:46:24
Speaker 1 :another possible universe where you
 could have become a theoretical physicist at Caltech or something like

1:46:34
Speaker 0 :that that's very possible some of my and
 undergrad classmates then the later studies physics account there 15 physicsfrom these schools from yeah from tough
 physics programs so so you you switch to

1:46:50
Speaker 1 :I mean in that from that experience to
 doing physics in your bachelor's how what means you decide to switch tocomputer science and computer science
 had arguably the best university one of the best universities in the world forcomputer science and with Carnegie
 Mellon especially for the grad school and and so on so what ii only 10 mightyjust kidding okay


1:47:14
Speaker 0 :

1:47:16
Speaker 1 :I had Authority and know what what was
 the choice like and what was the move to the United States like what was thatwhole transition and if you remember if
 there's still echoes of some of the spirit of the people of China in you in

1:47:31
Speaker 0 :New York it's like three questions so
 yes I guess okay the first transition from physics to computer science yes sowhen I first came to the United States I
 was actually in the physics ph.d program at Cornell yeah I was there for one yearand then I switched to computer science
 and I was seeing the PC program at kind of give a loan and so okay so thereasons for switching so one thing so
 that's why I also mentions that about this difference in backgrounds abouthaving studied physics yes first in my
 undergrad um actually really I really did enjoy myundergrads time and education in physics
 I think that actually really helped me in my future work in computer scienceactually even for machine learning a lot
 of machine learning stuff the the core machining methods many of the magic

1:48:35
Speaker 1 :for honest most most of everything came


1:48:36
Speaker 0 :

1:48:38
Speaker 1 :

1:48:39
Speaker 0 :from physics I was I think I was really
 attracted to physics and it was it's really beautiful and educated physics isthe language of nature and I actually
 really remember like one moment in my undergrads like I did my undergrad inChinua and I used to study in the
 library and I clearly remember like one day I was sitting in a library and I andI was like writing my notes and so on
 and I got so excited that I realized that if you just from a few simpleaxioms a few simple laws I can derive so
 much it's almost like I can't derive the rest of the world yeah there's the

1:49:35
Speaker 1 :

1:49:35
Speaker 0 :universe yes yes so that was like
 amazing do you think you have you ever

1:49:39
Speaker 1 :seen or do you think you can rediscover
 that kind of power and beauty and computer science in the world that yes

1:49:47
Speaker 0 :that's very interesting so that gets to
 you know the transition from physics to Versailles and it's a it's quitedifferent for and for physics in in
 Cresco actually things changed so one is I started to realize that when I starteddoing research in physics at the time I
 was doing theoretical physics and a lot of its the you still have the beautybase very different so I have to
 actually do a lot of simulation so essentially I was actually writing insome in some cases writing a fortune


1:50:25
Speaker 1 :

1:50:26
Speaker 0 :Harold fortune yes to actually write do
 like do simulations and so on that was not not exact II enjoy it's doing
 and also at the time from talking with the senior you know students in theprogram I realized many of the students
 actually were going off to work Wall Street and and so on and so and I'vealways been interested in computer
 science and actually essentially taught myself the C programming program rightwhen in college and college somewhere


1:51:12
Speaker 1 :

1:51:13
Speaker 0 :

1:51:15
Speaker 1 :

1:51:16
Speaker 0 :for fun learning to do C programming you


1:51:18
Speaker 1 :

1:51:19
Speaker 0 :know in physics at the time I think now
 the programming profit has changed but at the time really the only class we hadin in Hoosick amir science education was
 introduction to africa to computer science or computing and fortune 77there's a lot of people that still use


1:51:40
Speaker 1 :Fortran I'm actually if you're a
 programmer out there I'm looking for an expert to talk to about Fortran theyseem to there's not many but there's
 still a lot of people to still use Fortran and still a lot of people these

1:51:56
Speaker 0 :cobalt I realized
 instead of just doing programming for doing simulations and so on that I mayas well just change to computer science
 and also one thing I really like and that's a key difference between the twoas in computer science is so much easier
 to realize your ideas if you have idea you're writing it up you're cut it upand then you can see it's actually bring
 it to life quickly it's your life wasting physics if you how good theoryyou you have to wait for the
 experimentalist to do the experiments and to confirm the theory and thingsjust take so much longer and and also
 the reason I in physics I decided to do theoretical physics it was because I hadmy experience with experimental physics
 first you have to fix the equipment fixing the equipment first so

1:52:56
Speaker 1 :offensive equipment so there's a lot of
 it yeah he's have to collaborate with a lot of people takes a long time yes

1:53:02
Speaker 0 :messy so I decided to switch to computer
 science and the one thing I think maybe people have realized is that for peoplewho study physics actually it's very
 easy for physicists to change to do something else yes I think physicsprovides a really good training and yeah
 so actually it was very easy to switch to computer science but one thing goingback to your earlier question so one
 thing I should you realize so there is a big difference between commune sense andphysics away physics you can derive the
 the whole universe from just a few simple laws and computer science giventhat a lot of it is defined by humans
 the systems that you find by humans and and artificial I can essentially createa lot of these artifacts and so on and
 it's it's not quite the same you don't derive the computer systemswith just a few simple laws you actually
 have to see there's historical reasons why our system is builds and designs oneway versus the a day there's a lot more


1:54:13
Speaker 1 :complexity or less elegant simplicity of
 e equals mc-squared that kind of reduces everything down to his beautifulfundamental equations but what about the
 move from China to the United States is there anything that still stays in youthat's contributes to your work the fact
 that you grew up in another culture so

1:54:37
Speaker 0 :yes I think especially back then it's
 very different from now so you know now they actually I see these studentscoming from China and even an aggressor
 actually they speak fluent English it was just you know like amazing and theyhave already understood so much of the
 culture in the US and so on and it was

1:55:03
Speaker 1 :to you was all foreign it was it was a


1:55:05
Speaker 0 :very different time at a time actually
 even we didn't even have access to email right not to mention about the wealthyeah I remember I had to go to you know
 specific like you know privileged several rooms too much knowledge aboutthe Western world and actually at the
 time I didn't know actually the the in the US the West Coast weather is so muchbetter than the yeah things like that
 actually it's very it's very yeah but now it's so different at the time I Iwould say there's also a bigger culture
 difference because there's so much less opportunity for shared information soit's such a different right I meant
 world

1:56:03
Speaker 1 :let me ask me be a sensor question I'm
 not sure but I think you're not in similar positions is I've been here foralready 20 years as well and looking at
 Russia from our perspective and you looking at China in some ways it's avery distant place because it's changed
 a lot but in some ways you still have echoes you have still have knowledge ofthat place the question is you know
 China is doing a lot of incredible work in AI do you see please tell me there'san optimistic picture you see where the
 United States and China can collaborate and sort of grow together in thedevelopment of AI towards you know
 there's different values in terms of the role of government and so on of ethicaltransparent secure systems we see it
 differently in the I States a little bit than China but we're still trying towork it out do you see the two countries
 being able to successfully collaborate and work in a healthy way without sortof fighting and making it an AI arms
 race kind of situation yeah I believe so

1:57:06
Speaker 0 :and I think it's science there's no
 border and the advancement of technology helps everyone helps the whole world andso I certainly hope that the two
 countries will collaborate and I certainly believe so do you have

1:57:27
Speaker 1 :any reason to believe so except being an


1:57:31
Speaker 0 :optimist so first again like I said
 science has no borders and especially

1:57:36
Speaker 1 :science doesn't know board borders right
 and you believe that will you know in this in the former Soviet Union duringthe Cold War


1:57:44
Speaker 0 :yeah so this is the other point I was
 going to mention is that especially in academic research everything is publiclike we write papers we open source
 codes and others in the public domain it doesn't matter whether the person is inthe u.s. in China or some other parts of
 the world and they can go on archive and look at the latest research and results

1:58:09
Speaker 1 :so that openness gives you hope yes me
 too

1:58:12
Speaker 0 :and that's also how as a world we make
 progress the best so apologize for the

1:58:18
Speaker 1 :romanticized question but looking back
 what would you say was the most transformative moment in your life thatmaybe made you fall in love with
 computer science you said physics you remember there was a moment where youthought you could derive the entirety of
 the universe was there a moment that you really fell in love with the work you donow from security to machine learning to
 program synthesis so maybe as I

1:58:48
Speaker 0 :mentioned actually in college a one
 summer I should tell myself programming see yes you just read a bug don't tellme you fell in love with computer


1:59:01
Speaker 1 :science by programming and see remember


1:59:04
Speaker 0 :I mentioned when one of the draws for me
 to come here sense is how easy it is to realize their ideas so once I you don'tread the book started like it taught
 myself how to program and see immediately what what did I dolike I programmed two games um
 ones just simple like it's a go game like it supports you can move the stonesand so on and the other one actually
 programmed the game that's like a 3d Tetris it was a to not to be a superhard game to play
 it's obvious the standard 2d Tetris it's actually a 3d thing but I can realizewow you know I just had these ideas to
 try it out and then you can just do this so that's the one I realized wow this isamazing


1:59:53
Speaker 1 :yeah you can create yourself from


1:59:55
Speaker 0 :

1:59:57
Speaker 1 :nothing to something that's actually out
 in the real world so let me ask let me ask a silly questionor maybe the ultimate question what is
 to you the meaning of life what what gives your life meaning purposefulfillment happiness joy okay


2:00:19
Speaker 0 :these are two different questions very
 different yeah it's easy that you asked this question maybe this question isprobably the question that has follows
 me and follow my life the most have you

2:00:32
Speaker 1 :discovered anything and you satisfactory
 answer for yourself is there something

2:00:38
Speaker 0 :

2:00:39
Speaker 1 :is there something you've arrived at you
 know that there's a moment I've talked to a few people who have faced forexample a cancer diagnosis or faced
 their own mortality and that seems to change their views and it it seems to bea catalyst for them removing most of the
 crap that the of seeing that most of what they've been doing is not thatimportant and really reducing it into
 saying like here's is actually the few things that really give me give meaningmortality is a really powerful catalyst
 for that it seems like facing mortality whether it's your parents dying orsomebody close to you dying or facing
 your own death for whatever reason or

2:01:23
Speaker 0 :cancer and so on yeah in my own case I
 didn't need to face mortality and I think there are a couple things so oneis like who should be defining the
 meaning of your life right is there some kind of even greater things than you whoshould define the meaning of your life
 so for example when people say that searching the meaning for our life is isthere some there is some outside voice
 or is there something you know a set of you who actually tells you you know somepeople talk about oh you know this is
 what you have been born to do right right like this is your destiny um sowho right so that's the one question
 like who gets to define the meaning of your life should you be finding someother thing some other factor to define
 this for you always something actually it's just entirely where you defineyourself and it can be very arbitrary


2:02:38
Speaker 1 :yeah so in inner and inner voice or an
 outer voice whether it's it could be spiritual religious - with God or someother components of the environment
 outside of you or just your own voice do you have up do you have an answer there

2:02:53
Speaker 0 :and so you know you know the long period
 of time of thinking and searching even searching through outsides right youknow voices are factors outside of me
 yeah so that I have and so I've come to the conclusion and realization that it'syou yourself that you finds the meaning
 of life yeah that's a big burden no

2:03:18
Speaker 1 :

2:03:22
Speaker 0 :isn't it right so then you have the
 freedom to define it yes and and another question is like what does it reallymean by the meaning of life right um and
 also whether the question even make sense absolutely and you said it somehow

2:03:45
Speaker 1 :distinct from happiness so meaning is
 something much deeper than just any kind of emotional any any kind of contentmentor joy whatever it might be much deeper
 and then you have to ask what is deeper than thatwhat is
 what is there at all and then the question starts being silly right and

2:04:07
Speaker 0 :also you can say it's deeper but you can
 also say it's a shallow depending on how people want to define the meaning oftheir life so for example most people
 don't even think about this question then the meaning of life to them itdoesn't really matter that much and also
 whether knowing the meaning of life and whether actually helps y'all love to bepresent area or whether helps your life
 to be happier and these actually are often questions is not worse most

2:04:36
Speaker 1 :questions open I tend to think that just
 asking the question as you mentioned as you've done for a long time is the onlythat there is no answer and asking the
 question is a really good exercise I mean I have this for me personally I'vehad the kind of feeling that creation is
 a like for me has been very fulfilling and it seems like my meaning has been tocreate and I'm not sure what that is
 like I I don't have a single lot of kids I would love to have kids but I alsosounds creepy but I also see sort of he
 said see programs I see programs as little creations I seerobots as little creations I think those
 are met those of those bring and then ideas theorems and and are creations andthose somehow intrinsically like you
 said bring me joy I think they do to a lot of these scientists but I think theydid a lot of people so that to me if I
 had to force the answer to that I would say creating new things yourself for you

2:05:43
Speaker 0 :for me for me for me I don't know but


2:05:45
Speaker 1 :like you said as he keeps changing is
 there some answer that some people they

2:05:50
Speaker 0 :can I think they may say it's experience
 rights like their meaning of life all rightthey just want to experience to the
 richest and full as they can and a lot of people do take that path yes seeing

2:06:03
Speaker 1 :life is actually a collection of moments
 and then trying to make the richest possiblethat's filled those moments with the
 richest possible experiences yeah right

2:06:14
Speaker 0 :and for me I think it's certainly we do
 share a lot of similarity here like the creation is also really important for meeven from you know the things that I've
 already talked about even like you know writing papers and these are ourcreations as well and I have not quite
 thought whether that has really the meaning of my life like in a sense alsothat maybe like what kind of things
 should you create there's so many different things that you could createand also you can say another view is
 maybe growth is it's related but different from experience growth is alsomaybe type of meaning of life it's just
 you try to grow every day try to be a better self every day and and alsoultimately we are here it's part of the
 overall evolution the right the world is evolving it's funny it's funny that the

2:07:12
Speaker 1 :growth seems to be the more important
 thing than the thing you're growing towards it's like it's not the goal it'sthe the journey to it sort of it's
 almost it's almost when you submit a paper it's there's a sort of depressingelement to it not to submit a paper but
 when that whole project is over I mean there's a gratitude there's acelebration and so on but you're usually
 immediately looking for the next thing yeah the next step right it's not it'snot that status that at the end of it is
 not the satisfaction is the the hardship the challenge you have to overcome thegrowth through the process it's
 something it's somehow probably deeply within us the same thing that drove thatdrives the evolutionary process is
 somehow within us with everything the way the way we see the world sinceyou're thinking about this so you're
 still in search of an answer I mean yes

2:08:02
Speaker 0 :and no in the sense that I think for
 people who really dedicate time to search for the answer to ask a questionwhat is the meaning of life it does not
 as we bring your happiness

2:08:19
Speaker 1 :

2:08:20
Speaker 0 :yeah it's a question and we can say
 right like weather is a well-defined question and and on the other and but onthe other hand given that you get two
 answers yourself you can define it yourselfsure I can't just you know give it
 answer and in that sense yes it can help and like it's like we discussed if yousay oh then my meaning of life is to
 create are to grow then then yes then I think they can help but how do you knowthat that is really the meaning of life
 are the meaning of your life it's like there's no way for you to really answerthe question sure but something about


2:09:06
Speaker 1 :that certainty is liberating so if it
 might be an illusion you know you might not really know you might be justconvincing yourself falsely falsely but
 being sure that that's the meaning the there's something there's somethingliberating in that in that there's
 something freeing in knowing this is your purpose so you can fully giveyourself to that without you know for a
 long time you know I thought like isn't it all right like why what's how do weeven know what's good and what's evil
 like it isn't everything just relative like how do we know you know the thequestion of meaning is ultimately the
 question of why do anything why is anything good or bad why is anythingmoment then you start to I think just
 like you said I think it's a really useful question to ask but if you ask itfor too long and too aggressively I mean
 not be so protect it not be productive and not just for traditionally societyto find success but also for happiness
 it seems like asking the question about the meaning of life is like a trap is uhwere destined to be asking we destined
 to look up to the stars and ask these big white questions we'll never be ableto answer but we shouldn't get lost in
 them and that's probably the that's at least alesson I picked up so far I'm noting
 that topic let me just add one more

2:10:38
Speaker 0 :thing so it's interesting so actually so
 sometimes yes it can help you and to focus so when I when I shifted my focusmore from security to a I am a Sunni at
 the time the actually one of the main reason why I did that was because at thetime I thought my mini the meaning of my
 life and the purpose of my life is to build in hydrogen machines and that's

2:11:14
Speaker 1 :and then your inner voice said that this
 is the right this is the right journey to take to build intelligent machinesand that you actually fully realized you
 took a really legitimate big step to become one of the world classresearchers to actually make it to
 actually go down that journey yeah that's profound that's profound I don'tthink there's a better way to end a
 conversation than talking for for a while about the meaning of life doneit's a huge honor to talk to you thank
 you so much for talking today thank you

2:11:48
