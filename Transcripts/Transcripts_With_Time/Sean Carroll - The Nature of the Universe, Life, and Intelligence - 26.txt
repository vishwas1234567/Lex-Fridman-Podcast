Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Sean Carroll he's a theoretical physicist at Caltech specializing inquantum mechanics gravity and cosmology
 he's the author of several popular books one on the arrow of time called frometernity to here one on the Higgs boson
 called particle at the end of the universe and one on science ofphilosophy called the big picture on the
 origins of life meaning in the universe itself he has an upcoming book onquantum mechanics that you can pre-order
 now called something deeply hidden he writes one of my favorite blogs and hiswebsite preposterous universe com I
 recommend clicking on the greatest-hits link that lists accessible interestingposts on the arrow of time dark matter
 dark energy the Big Bang general relativity string theory quantummechanics and the big meta questions
 about the philosophy of science God ethics politics academia and muchmuch more finally and perhaps most
 famously he's the host of a podcast called mindscape that you shouldsubscribe to and support on patreon
 along with the Joe Rogan experience Sam Harris is making sense and Dan Carlin'shardcore history sean's mindscape
 podcast is one of my favorite ways to learn new ideas or explore differentperspectives and ideas that I thought I
 understood it was truly an honor to meet and spend a couple hours with Sean it'sa bit heartbreaking to say that for the
 first time ever the audio recorder for this podcast died in the middle of ourconversation there are technical reasons
 for this having to do with phantom power that I now understand and will avoid ittook me one hour to notice and fix the
 problem so much like the universal 60 percent dark energy roughly the sameamount in this conversation was lost
 except in the memories of the two people involved and in my notes I'm sure we'lltalk again and continue this
 conversation on this podcast or on Shawn's and of course I look forward toit
 this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe onYouTube iTunes supported on patreon or
 simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman and now here's my conversation

0:02:19
Speaker 0 :

0:02:20
Speaker 1 :with Sean Carroll what do you think is
 more interesting and impactful understanding how the universe works ata fundamental level or understanding how


0:02:28
Speaker 0 :the human mind works you know of course
 this is a crazy meaningless unanswerable question in some sense because they'reboth very interesting and there's no
 absolute scale of interestingness that we can rate them on there's the glibanswers that says the human brain is
 part of the universe right and therefore under saying the universe is morefundamental than understanding the human


0:02:46
Speaker 1 :brain but do you really believe that
 once we understand the fundamental way the universe works at the particle levelthe forces we would be able to
 understand how the mind works no

0:02:55
Speaker 0 :certainly not we cannot understand how
 ice cream works just from understanding how particles work right so a bigbeliever in emergence I'm a big believer
 that there are different ways of talking about the world beyond just the mostfundamental microscopic one you know
 when we talk about tables and chairs and planets and people we're not talking thelanguage of particle physics and
 cosmology so but understanding the universe you didn't say just at the mostfundamental level right so understanding
 the universe at all levels is part of that I do think you have to be a littlebit more fair to the question there
 probably are general principles of complexity biology informationprocessing memory knowledge creativity
 that go beyond just the human brain right and and maybe one could countunderstanding those as part of
 understanding the universe the human brain as far as we know is the mostcomplex thing in the universe so there's
 it's certainly absurd to think that by understanding the fundamental laws ofparticle physics you get any direct


0:04:01
Speaker 1 :insight on how the brain works but then
 there's this step from the fundamentals of particle physics to informationprocessing yeah a lot of physicists and
 philosophers maybe a little bit carelessly take when they talk aboutartificial intelligence do you think of
 the universe as a kind of a computational device know

0:04:20
Speaker 0 :to be like the honest answer there is no
 there's a sense in which the universe processes information clearly there's asense in which the universe is like a
 computer clearly but in some sense I think I tried to say this once on myblog and no one agreed with me but the
 universe is more like a computation than a computer because the universe happensonce a computer is a general-purpose
 machine right if you can ask it different questions even a pocketcalculator right and it's set up to
 answer certain kinds of questions the universe isn't that so informationprocessing happens in the universe but
 it's not what the universe is because I know your MIT colleagues that Lloydfeels very differently about this well


0:05:02
Speaker 1 :you're thinking of the universe it's a
 closed system I am so what makes a computer more like a like a PC like acomputing machine is that there's a
 human that everyone comes up to it and moves the mouse around yeah so inputgives it input gives it input and your
 and that's why you're saying is just a computation a deterministic thing that'sjust unrolling but the immense
 complexity of it is nevertheless like processing there's a state and then itchanges with good rule with rules and
 there's a sense for a lot of people that if the brain operates the human brainoperates within that world then it's
 simply just a small subset of that and so there's no reason we can't buildarbitrarily great intelligences yeah do
 you think of intelligence in this way

0:05:58
Speaker 0 :intelligence is tricky I don't have a
 definition of it offhand so I remember this panel discussion that I saw onYouTube I wasn't there but Seth Lloyd
 was on the panel and so was Martin Rees the famous astrophysicist and Seth gavehis shtick for why the universe is a
 computer and explained this and and and Martin we said so what is not a computerthat's a good question I'm not sure
 because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is theneverything is right and the simile or
 the analogy gains force when it excludes some things youknow is the moon going around the earth
 performing a computation I can come up with definitions in which the answer isyes but it's not a very useful
 computation I think that it's absolutely helpful to think about the universe incertain situations certain contexts as
 an information processing device I am even guilty of writing a paper calledquantum circuit cosmology where we
 modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit as a circuit as a circuit yeahand what you bits kind of with new bits
 basically right yeah so in cube it's becoming more and more entangled so whatdo you want to do want to digress a
 little bit this is kind of fun so here's a mystery about the universe that is sodeep and profound that nobody talks
 about it space expands right and we talk about in a certain region of space acertain number of degrees of freedom a
 certain number of ways that the quantum fields and the particles in that regioncan arrange themselves that that number
 of degrees of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite we actuallydon't know how many there are but
 there's a very good argument it says it's a finite number so as the universeexpands and space gets bigger
 are there more degrees of freedom if it's an infinite number it doesn'treally matter infinity times two is
 still infinity but if it's a finite number then there's more space sothere's more degrees of freedom so where
 did they come from that would mean the universe is not a closed system there'smore degrees of freedom popping into
 existence so what we suggested was that there are more degrees of freedom andit's not that they're not there to start
 but they're not entangled to start so the universe that you and I know of zienover the three dimensions around us that
 we see we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom making up space-timeand as the universe expands there's a
 whole bunch of qubits in their in their zero State that become entangled withthe rest of space-time through the


0:08:29
Speaker 1 :action of these quantum circuits so what
 does it mean that there's now more degrees of freedom as they become moreintegral yeah so this is the universe


0:08:41
Speaker 0 :expands that's right so there's more and
 more degrees of freedom they're entangled that areplaying part playing the role a part of
 the entangled space-time structure so the basic the underlying philosophy isthat space-time itself arises from the
 entanglement of some fundamental quantum

0:08:56
Speaker 1 :degrees of freedom Wow okay so at which
 point is most of the the the entanglement happening are we talkingabout close to the bing bang are we
 talking about throughout the the time

0:09:11
Speaker 0 :right yeah so the idea is that at the
 Big Bang almost all the degrees of freedom thatthe universe could have were there but
 they were unentangled with anything else and that's a reflection of the fact thatthe Big Bang had a low entropy it was
 very simple very small place and as space expands more and more degrees offreedom become entangled with the rest


0:09:33
Speaker 1 :of the world well I have to ask John
 Carroll what do you think of the thought experiment from Nick Bostrom that we'reliving in a simulation so I think let me
 contextualize that a little bit more I think people don't actually take thisthought experiments I think it's quite
 interesting it's not very useful but it's quite interesting from theperspective of AI a lot of the learning
 that can be done usually happens in simulation from artificial examples andso it's a constructive question to ask
 how difficult is our real world to simulate right which is kind of a dualpart of for living in a simulation and
 somebody built that simulation now how if you were to try to do it yourself howhard would it be so obviously we could


0:10:19
Speaker 0 :be living a simulation if you just want
 the physical possibility then I completely agree that it's physicallypossible I don't think that we actually
 are so take this one piece of data into consideration you know we we live in abig universe okay there's two trillion
 galaxies in our observable universe with 200 billion stars in each galaxy etc itwould seem to be a waste of resources to
 have a universe that big going on just to do a simulation so in other words Iwant to be a good Bayesian I want to ask
 under this hypothesis what do I expect to see so the first thing I would say isI wouldn't expect to see a universe that
 was that big okay the second thing is I wouldn'texpect the resolution of the universe to
 be as good as it is so it's always possible that if they're superhumansimulators only have finite resources
 that they don't render the entire universe right that that the part thatis out there that two trillion galaxies
 isn't actually being simulated fully okay but then the obvious extrapolationof that is that only I am being
 simulated fully like the rest of you are just part not non-player charactersright I'm the only thing that is real
 the rest of you are just chatbots beyond this wall I see the wall butthere is literally nothing on the other
 side of the wall that is sort of the Bayesian prediction that's what it wouldbe like to do an efficient simulation of
 me so like none of that seems quiterealistic there's that I don't see I
 hear the argument that it's just possible and easy to simulate lots ofthings I don't see any evidence from
 what we know about our universe that we look like a simulated universe now maybeyou could say well we don't know what it
 would look like but that's just abandoning your Bayesianresponsibilities like your your job is
 to say under this theory here's what you would expect to see yes certainly if you

0:12:09
Speaker 1 :think about simulation is a thing that's
 like a video game where only a small subset is being rendered but say theentire all of the laws of physics it the
 entire closed system of the quote-unquote universe mm-hmm it had a

0:12:27
Speaker 0 :creator yeah it's always possible all


0:12:28
Speaker 1 :right so that's not useful to think
 about when you're thinking about physics the way Nick Bostrom phrases it if is ifit's possible to simulate a universe
 eventually we'll do it right you could use that by the way for a lot of thingswell yeah but I guess the question is
 how hard is it to create a universe I

0:12:51
Speaker 0 :wrote a little blog post about this and
 maybe maybe I'm missing something but there's an argument that says not onlythat it might be possible to simulate a
 universe but probably if you imagine that you actually attributeconsciousness and agency to the little
 things that we're simulating to our little artificial beingsthere's probably a lot more of them than
 there are ordinary organic beings in the universe or there will be in the futureright so there's an argument that not
 only is being a simulation possible it's probable because in the space of allliving consciousness is most of them are
 being simulated right most of them are not at the top level I think thatargument must be wrong because it
 follows from that argument that you know if we're simulated but we can alsosimulate other things well but if we can
 simulate other things they can simulate other things rightif we give them enough power and
 resolution and ultimately we'll reach a bottom because the laws of physics inour universe have a bottom or made of
 atoms and so forth so there will be the cheapest possiblesimulations and if you believe the
 original argument you should conclude that we should be in the cheapestpossible simulation because that's where
 most people are but we don't look like that doesn't look at all like we're atthe edge of resolution you know there
 were 16-bit you know things but it's it seems much easier to make much lowerlevel things that then we are so and
 also I questioned the whole approach to the anthropic principle that says we aretypical observers in the universe I
 think that that's not actually I think that there's a lot of selection that wecan do that we're typically in things we
 already know but not typical within all

0:14:32
Speaker 1 :the universe so do you think there's
 intelligent life however you would like to define intelligent life out there in

0:14:40
Speaker 0 :the universe my guess is that there is
 not intelligent life in the observable universe other than us simply on thebasis of the the fact that the likely
 number of other intelligent species in the observable universe there's twolikely numbers zero or billions and if
 there had been billions we would have noticed already - for there to beliterally like a small number like you
 know Star Trek there's you know a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxybut not a billion that that's weird that
 that's sort of bizarre to me it's easy for me to imagine that there are zeroothers because there's just a big
 bottleneck to making multicellular life orlogical life or whatever it's very hard
 for me to imagine that there's a whole bunch out there that have somehow

0:15:32
Speaker 1 :remained hidden from us the question I'd
 like to ask is what would intelligent life look like the what I mean by thatquestion in a war that's going is what
 if intelligent life is just fundamental it's in some very big ways differentthan our the one that has on earth that
 there's all kinds of intelligent life that operates in different scales ofboth size and temporal right that's a


0:15:57
Speaker 0 :great possibility because I think we
 should be humble about what intelligence is what life is we don't even agree onwhat life is much less what intelligent
 life is right so that that's an argument for humility saying there could beintelligent life of a very different
 character right like you could imagine that dolphins are intelligent but neverinvent space travel because they live in
 the ocean and they don't have thumbs right so they never invent technologyyou never events melting maybe the
 universe is full of intelligent species that just don't make technology rightthat that's compatible with the data I
 think and and I think maybe maybe what you're pointing at is even more outthere versions of intelligence you know
 intelligence in inter molecular clouds or on the surface of a neutron star orin between the galaxies and giant things
 where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years on the one hand yes weshould be very open-minded about those
 things on the other hand we all all of us share the same laws of physics theremight be something about the laws of
 physics even though we don't currently know exactly what that thing would bethat makes meters and years the right
 length and time scales for intelligent life maybe not but you know we're madeof atoms atoms have a certain size we
 orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime it's not impossible to me thatthere's a sweet spot for intelligent
 life that we find ourselves in so I'm hoping mine didn't either way I won'tmind either being humble and there's all
 sorts of different kinds of life or no there's a reason we just don't know ityet why life like ours is the kind of


0:17:41
Speaker 1 :life that's out there yeah I'm of two
 minds too but I often wonder if our brains is just designed to quiteobviously to operate and see the world
 in the unnies timescales and we're almost blind and and the tools we'vecreated for detecting things are blind
 yeah to the kind of observation needed to see intelligent life or other skills

0:18:04
Speaker 0 :well I'm totally open to that but so
 here's another argument I would make you know we have looked for intelligent lifebut we've looked at for it in the
 dumbest way we can rise by turning radio telescopes to the sky and why in theworld would a super advanced
 civilization randomly beam out radio signals wastefully in all directionsinto the universe that just doesn't make
 any sense especially because in order to thinkthat you would actually contact another
 civilization you would have to do it forever you have to keep doing it formillions of years that sounds like a
 waste of resources if you thought that there were other solar systems withplanets around them where maybe
 intelligent life didn't yet exist but might someday you wouldn't try to talkto it with radio waves she would send a
 spacecraft out there and you would park it around there and it would be likefrom our point of view be like 2001 or
 there's an you know an monolith monolith so there could be an artifact in factthe other way works also right there
 could be artifacts in our solar system that are have been put there by othertechnologically advanced civilizations
 and that's how we will eventually contact them and we have just haven'texplored the solar system well enough
 yet to find them the reason why we don't think about that is because we're youngand impatient right like it would take
 more than my lifetime to actually send something to another star system andwait for it and then come back so but if
 if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands of years or million yeartimescales that's clearly the right
 thing to do

0:19:34
Speaker 1 :are you excited by the thing that Elon
 Musk says don't pay sex in general space but the idea of space exploration eventhough your or your species is young and


0:19:45
Speaker 0 :impatient ya know I do think that space
 travel is crucially important long term even to other star systems and I thinkthat many people overestimate the
 difficulty because they say look if you travel 1% the speed of light to anotherstar system will be dead before we get
 there right and I think that it's much easier and therefore when they writetheir science fiction stories they
 imagine we feel fast from the speed of light because otherwise they are tooimpatient right we're not gonna go
 faster than the speed of light but we could easily imagine that the humanlifespan gets extended to thousands of
 years and once you do that then the stars are much closer effectively rightand what's a hundred year trip right so
 I think that that's gonna be the future the far future not not my lifetime onceagain but baby steps and unless your


0:20:30
Speaker 1 :lifetime gets extended well it's in a


0:20:32
Speaker 0 :race against time right a friend of mine
 who actually thinks about these things said you know you and I are gonna diebut I don't know about our grandchildren
 that's right that's it I don't know for predicting the future is hard but that'sat least a plausible scenario and so ya
 know I think that as we discussed earlier there are threats to the earthknown and unknown right having spread
 humanity and biology elsewhere is a really important long-term goal what

0:21:04
Speaker 1 :kind of questions can science not
 currently answer but might soon when you think about the problems and themysteries before us hmm that may be
 within reach of science I think an

0:21:17
Speaker 0 :obvious one is the origin of life we
 don't know how that happened there's a difficulty in knowing how it happenedhistorically actually you know literally
 on earth but starting life from non-life is something I kind of think we're close

0:21:32
Speaker 1 :to right we really think so how like how
 difficult is it to start lie - well I

0:21:36
Speaker 0 :I've talked to people including on the
 podcast about this you know life requires three things life as we know itso there's a difference with life which
 who knows what it is and life as we know it which we can talkabout with some intelligence so life as
 we know it requires compartmentalization you need like a little membrane aroundyour cell metabolism you take in food
 and eat it and let that make you do things and then replication okay so youneed to have some information about
 you are that you passed down through to future generations in the labcompartmentalization seems pretty easy
 not hard to make lipid bilayers that come into a little cellular walls prettyeasily metabolism and replication are
 hard but replication we're close to people have made RNA like molecules inthe lab that I think the state of the
 art is they're not able to make one molecule that reproduces itself butthey're able to make two molecules that
 reproduce each other yeah so that's okay that's pretty close metabolism is hardto believe it or not even though it's
 sort of the most obvious thing but you want some sort of controlled metabolismand the actual cellular machinery in our
 bodies is quite complicated it's hard to see it just popping into existence allby itself probably took a while but it's
 we're making progress and in fact I don't think we're spending nearly enoughmoney on it if I were the NSF I would
 flood this area with money because it would change our view of the world if wecould actually make life in the lab and
 understand how it was made originally here on earth and I'm sure have some

0:23:09
Speaker 1 :ripple effects that help cure disease
 and so on I mean that just that ending

0:23:14
Speaker 0 :so synthetic biology is a wonderful big
 frontier where we're making cells the right now the best way to do that is toborrow heavily from existing biology
 right where craig Venter several years ago created an artificial cell but allhe did was not all he did it was a
 tremendous accomplishment but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell and putin an entirely new DNA and let it boot
 up and go hmm what about the leap to

0:23:37
Speaker 1 :creating intelligent life on Earth yeah
 however again we define intelligence of course but let's just even say Homosapiens the the modern the modern
 intelligence in our human brain you have a sense of what's involved in that leapand how big of a leap that is so AI


0:23:59
Speaker 0 :would count in this or you really want
 life you want a really organism in some

0:24:05
Speaker 1 :sense AI would count okay I yeah of
 course of course AI would come but well

0:24:11
Speaker 0 :let's say artificial consciousness right
 so I do not think we are on the threshold of creating artificialconsciousness I think it's possible
 I'm not again very educated about how close we are but my impression is notthat we're really close because we
 understand how little how little we understand of consciousness and what itis so if we don't have any idea what it
 is it's hard to imagine we're on the threshold of making it ourselvesbut it's doable it's possible I don't
 see any obstacles in principle so yeah I would hold out some interest in thathappening eventually I think in general


0:24:40
Speaker 1 :consciousness I think we'll be just
 surprised how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence you know I thinkconsciousness is the thing that that's
 just something we all fake

0:24:55
Speaker 0 :well good no actually I like this idea
 that in fact consciousness is way less mysterious than we think yeah becausewe're all at every time at every moment
 less conscious than we think we are right we can fool things and I thinkthat plus the idea that you not only
 have artificial intelligent systems but you put them in a body right give them arobot body that will help the faking a
 lot yeah I think I think creating

0:25:19
Speaker 1 :consciousness in our artificial
 consciousness is as simple as asking a Roomba to say I'm conscious and refusingto be talked out of it could be it could
 be and I mean I'm almost being silly but that's what we do yeah that's what we dowith each other this is the kind of that
 consciousness is also a social construct and a lot of our ideas of intelligenceis a social construct and so reaching
 that bar involves something that's beyond that's not necessarily involvethe fundamental understanding of how you
 go from electrons to neurons to cognition no I actually I think that is

0:26:02
Speaker 0 :a really good point and in fact what it
 suggests is you know so yeah you referred to Kate Kate darling who I hadon the podcast and who does these
 experiments with very simple robots but they look like animals and they can looklike they're experiencing pain and we
 human beings react very negatively to these little robots looking like they'reexperiencing pain and what you want to
 say is yeah but they're just robots it's not really painhe's just some electrons going around
 but then you realize you know you and I are just electrons going around andthat's what pain is also and so what I
 what I would have an easy time imagining is that there is a spectrum betweenthese simple robots that Kate works with
 and a human being where there are things that sort of by some strict definitiontouring test level thing are not
 conscious but nevertheless walk and talk like they're conscious and it could bethat the future is I mean
 Siri is close right and so it might be the future has a lot more agents likethat and in fact rather than some day
 going aha we have consciousness will just creep up on it with more and moreaccurate reflections of what we expect


0:27:15
Speaker 1 :and in the future maybe the present for
 example we haven't met before and you're made basically assuming that I'm human

0:27:24
Speaker 0 :as it's a high probability at this time


0:27:27
Speaker 1 :because the yeah but in the future there
 might be question marks on that right yeah no absolutely

0:27:32
Speaker 0 :certainly videos are almost to the point
 where you shouldn't trust them already photos you can't trust right videos iseasier to trust but we're getting worse
 that yeah we're getting better at faking them Yeah right getting betteryeah so physical embodied people what's
 what's so hard about faking that so this is very depressing this conversation

0:27:54
Speaker 1 :right so to me is excited you're doing


0:27:54
Speaker 0 :it so exciting to you but it's a
 sobering thought we're very bad right yet imagining what the next 50 years aregonna be like when we're in the middle
 of a phase transition as who you are

0:28:04
Speaker 1 :right now yeah and I in general I'm not
 blind to all the threats yeah I am excited by the power of technology tosolve to protect us against the threats
 as they evolve I'm not as much as Steven Pinker optimistic about the world but ineverything I've seen all the brilliant
 people in the world that I've met are good people so the army of the good interms of the development of technology


0:28:33
Speaker 0 :is large okay you're way more optimistic
 than I am I think that goodness and badness are equally distributed amongintelligent and unintelligent people I
 don't see much of a correlation there interesting

0:28:44
Speaker 1 :neither of us have proof yeah exactly is


0:28:47
Speaker 0 :yeah
 again that pinions are freeze right nor

0:28:50
Speaker 1 :definitions of good and evil we come
 without definitions or with without data opinions so what kind of questionsconcerns not currently answer may never
 be able to answer in your view well the

0:29:04
Speaker 0 :obvious one is what is good and bad you
 know I know what is right and wrong I think that there are questions that youknow science tells us what happens what
 the world is and what it does it doesn't say what the world should do or what weshould do because we're part of the
 world but we are part of the world and we have the ability to feel likesomething's right something's wrong and
 to make a very long story very short I think that the idea of moral philosophyis systematizing our intuitions of what
 is right what is wrong and science might be able to predict ahead of time what wewill do but it won't ever be able to
 judge whether we should have done it or

0:29:39
Speaker 1 :not so you know you're kind of unique in
 terms of scientists listen it doesn't have to do with podcast but even justreaching out I think you referred to as
 sort of an doing interdisciplinary science so you reach out and talk topeople that are outside of your
 discipline which I always hope that's what science was for in fact I was alittle disillusioned when I realized
 that academia is very siloed yeah and so the question is how well at your ownlevel how do you prepare for these
 conversations how do you think about these conversations how do you open yourmind enough to have these conversations
 and it may be a little bit broader how can you advise other scientists tohave these kinds of conversations not at
 the podcast so the fact that you're doing a podcast is awesome other peopledon't hear them yeah but it's also good
 to have it without mics right in general

0:30:35
Speaker 0 :it's a good question but a tough one to
 answer I think about you know a guy knows a personal trainer and he wasasked on a podcast how do we you know
 psych ourselves up to do a workout how do we make that discipline to go andwork out he's like why you asking me
 like I can't stop working out like I don't need to psych myself up so andlikewise you know he asked me like how
 do you get to like have inner discipline conversations and all sorts of differentthings all sorts of different people and
 like that's that's what makes me go right like that's I couldn't stop doingthat I did that long before any of them
 were recorded in fact a lot of the motivation for starting recording it wasmaking sure I would read all these books
 that I had purchased right like all these books I wanted to read not enoughtime to read them and now if I have
 motivation because I'm gonna you know interview Pat Churchland I'm gonnafinally read her for her book you know
 and it's absolutely true that academia is extraordinarily siloed right we don'ttalk to people we rarely do and in fact
 when we do is punished you know like the people who do it successfully generallyfirst became very successful within
 their little silo you have discipline and only then did they start expandingout if you're a young person you know I
 I have graduate students I try to be very very candid with them about thisthat it's you know most graduate
 students are to not become faculty members right it's a it's a tough roadand so live the life you want to live
 but do it with your eyes open about what it does to your job chances and the morebroad you are and the less time you
 spend hyper specializing in your field the lower your job chances are that'sjust an academic reality it's terrible I
 don't like it yeah but it's a reality and for some people that's fine likethere's plenty of people who are
 wonderful scientists who have zero interest in branching out and talking tothings to anyone outside their field but
 it is disillusioning to me some of the you know romantic notion I had theintellectual academic life is belied by
 the reality of it the idea that we should reach out beyond our disciplineand that is a positive good is just so
 rare in universities that it may as well not exist at all but that said even

0:32:54
Speaker 1 :though you're saying you're doing it
 like the personal trainer because you just can't help it you're also aninspiration to others like I could speak
 for myself you know I also have a career I'm thinking about right now and withoutyour podcast I may
 not have been doing this at all right so it makes me realize that these kinds ofconversations is kind of what science is
 about in many ways what the reason we write papers this exchange of ideas isit's much harder to do interdisciplinary
