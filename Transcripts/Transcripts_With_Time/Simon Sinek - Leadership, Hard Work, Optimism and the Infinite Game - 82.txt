 now here's my conversation with simon Sinekin the infinite game your most recent
 book you describe the finite game in the infinite game so from my perspective ofartificial intelligence and game theory
 in general I'm a huge fan of finite games from the broad philosophical senseis something that in the robotics
 artificial intelligence space we know how to deal with and then you describethe infinite game which has no exact
 static rules has no well-defined static objective as the players are knownunknown they change there's a dynamic
 element so this is something that applies to business politics life itselfso can you try to articulate the
 objective function here of the infinite game or in the in the cliche broadphilosophical sense what is the meaning


0:04:41
Speaker 0 :of life go for the start with a soft


0:04:45
Speaker 1 :

0:04:45
Speaker 0 :ball you know easy question first
 so James Carr was the philosopher who originally articulated this concept offinite and infinite games and when I
 learned about it it really challenged my view of how the world works rightbecause I think we all think about
 winning and being the best and being number one but if you think about itonly in a finite game can that exist a
 game that has fixed rules agreed upon objectives and known players likefootball or baseball there's always a
 beginning middle and end and if there's a winner that has to be a loser infinitegames as cars describes them as you said
 have known and unknown players which means anyone can join it has achangeable rules which means you can
 play however you want and the objective is to perpetuate the game to stay in thegame as long as possible in other words
 there's no such thing as being number one or winning in a game that has nofinish line and what I learned is that
 when we try to win in a game that has no finish line we try and be number we tryto be the best in a game that has no
 agreed-upon objectives or agreed-upon metrics or timeframes there's a fewconsistent and predictable outcomes the
 decline of trust the decline the decline of cooperation the decline of innovationand I find this fascinating because so
 many of the ways that we run most organizations is with a finite mindset

0:06:03
Speaker 1 :you're trying to reduce the beautiful
 complex thing that is life or what politics or business into something verynarrow and in that process the
 reductionist process you lose something fundamental that makes the whole thingwork in the long term so returning not
 going to let you off the hook easy what is the meaning of life so what is theobjective function that is worthwhile to


0:06:31
Speaker 0 :pursue well if you think about our
 tombstones right they have the date we were born in the date we died but reallyit's what we do with the gap in between
 there's a poem called the - you know it's the - that matters it's what we dobetween the time we're going and the
 time we die that gives our life meaning and if we live our lives with a finitemindset which means to accumulate more
 power or money than anybody else to outdo everyone else to be number one tobe the best we don't take any of us with
 us we don't take any of it with us we just die the people who get rememberedthe way we want to be remembered is how
 what kind of people we were right devoted mother loving father what kindof person we were to other people Jack
 Welch just died recently and the Washington Post when it when it wrotethe headline for his for his obit it
 wrote he pleased Wall Street and distressed employees and that's hislegacy of a finite player who was
 obsessed with winning yes who leaves behind a legacy of short-term gains fora few and distress for many that's his
 legacy and every single one of us gets the choice of the kind of legacy one Ihave do we want to be remembered for our
 contributions or a dish or our detractions to live with a finitemindset to live a career with a finite
 mindset to be number one be the best be the most famous lay the life like JackWelch you know to live a life of service
 to to see those around us rise to contribute to our communities to ourorganizations to leave them in better
 shape than we found them that's that's the kind of legacy most of us would like

0:08:06
Speaker 1 :to have so day to day when you think
 about what is the the fundamental goals dreams motivations of an infinitegame of seeing your life your career is
 an infinite game what is that what does that look like I mean I guess I'm sortof trying to stick on this personal ego
 personal Drive the thing that the fire the reason we want to wake up in themorning and everything we can't go to
 bed because we're so excited yeah what

0:08:40
Speaker 0 :is that so for me it's about having a
 just cause it's about a vision that's bigger than methat my work gets to contribute to
 something larger than myself you know that's what drives me every day I wakeup every morning with a with a vision of
 a world that does not yet exist a world in which the vast majority of peoplewake up every single morning inspired
 feel safe at work and return home fulfilled at the end of the day is notthe world we live in and so that we
 still have work to do is the thing that drives me you know I know what I knowwhat my underlying values are you know I
 wake up to inspire people to do the things that inspire them and these arethe things that these are the things
 that I these are my go to is my touch points that inspire me to keep workingyou know I think of a career like an
 iceberg you know if you have a vision for something you're the only one whocan see the iceberg underneath the ocean
 but if you start working at it a little bit shows up and now a few other peoplecan see what you imagined be like oh
 right yeah no I want to help build that as well and if you have a lot of successthen you have a lot of iceberg and
 people can see this huge iceberg and they say you've accomplished so much butbut what I see is all the work still yet
 to be done yet I still see the huge

0:09:48
Speaker 1 :iceberg underneath the ocean and so the
 growth you talk about momentum so the incremental revealing of the iceberg is

0:09:57
Speaker 0 :what drives you well it necessarily is
 incremental what drives me is that is the realization is every is realizingthe iceberg bringing more of the iceberg
 from the unknown to the known bringing more of the vision from the imagination

0:10:10
Speaker 1 :to reality and you have this fundamental
 vision of optimism you call yourself an optimist I mean in this world I havesort of I see myself a little bit as the
 main character from the 88 by Dostoevsky who is also kind ofseen by society is a fool because he was
 optimistic so one can you maybe articulate where that sense of optimismcomes from and maybe also try to
 articulate your vision of the future where people are inspired or optimismdrives us yes it's easy to forget that
 when you look at social media and so on with the word toxicity a negativity canoften get more likes that optimism has a
 sort of a beauty to it and I I do hope it's out there so what can you try toarticulate a vision yeah so I mean for


0:11:01
Speaker 0 :me optimism and being an optimist is is
 just seeing the silver lining in every cloud you know even in tragedy it bringspeople together and the question is can
 we see that can you see can you see the beauty that is in everythingI don't think optimism is foolishness
 I don't think optimism is blindness though it probably involves some naivetethe belief that things will get better
 the belief that that we tend towards the good even in times of struggle or badyou know you can't sustain war but you
 can sustain peace you know I think I think things that are are stable aremore sustainable things that are
 optimistic are more sustainable than things that are you know chaotic so you

0:11:52
Speaker 1 :see people as fundamentally good I mean
 some people may disagree that you can't sus you can sustain peace you can'tsustain war I mean you don't have to you


0:12:00
Speaker 0 :I think war is costly you know it
 involves life and money and peace does not involve those things it requireswork I'm not saying it doesn't require
 work but it it doesn't drain resources I think the same way that war does you

0:12:15
Speaker 1 :know the the people that would say that
 we will always have war and I just talked to the story and a Stalin is youknow would say the conflict and the
 desire for power and conflict is essential to human nature is sucker butsomething in your words also perhaps
 it's the naive aspect that I also share is that you have an optimism that peopleare fundamentally


0:12:41
Speaker 0 :I'm an idealist you know I and I think
 idealism is good I'm not I'm not a fool to believe that the ideals that Iimagine can come true of course they'll
 never be world peace but shouldn't we die tryingyou know I think that's the whole point
 that's the point of vision vision should be idealistic and it should be allpractical purposes impossible but that
 doesn't mean we shouldn't try and it's the it's the milestones that we we reachthat take us closer to that ideal that
 make us feel that our life and our work have meaning and we're contributing tosomething bigger than ourselves you know
 we just because it's impossible doesn't mean we shouldn't try as I said we'restill moving the ball down the field
 we're still making progress things are still getting better even if we neverget to that that ideal state so I think
 idealism is a is a good thing you know

0:13:30
Speaker 1 :in the word infinite game one of the
 beautiful and tragic aspects of life human life at least at least from thebiological perspective is that it ends
 so sadly into some people yo fine fine it-it's it's tragic to some people or isit ends and I think some people believe


0:13:50
Speaker 0 :that it that it ends on the day you die
 and some people think it continues on

0:13:54
Speaker 1 :theirs and there's a lot of different
 ways to think what continues on the works like but let me drag it back tothe personal church is uh how do you
 think about your own mortality are you afraid of death how do you think aboutyour own death I definitely haven't


0:14:09
Speaker 0 :accomplished everything I want to
 contribute to I like more time in on this earth to keep working towards thatvision do you think about the fact that


0:14:20
Speaker 1 :it ends for you yeah you cognizant of


0:14:23
Speaker 0 :course I'm cognizant of it I mean not
 really all I I don't dwell on it I'm aware of it I know that my life isfinite and I know that I have a certain
 amount of time left on this planet and I'd like to make that time be valuable

0:14:39
Speaker 1 :you know some people would think that
 ideas kind of allow you to have a

0:14:47
Speaker 0 :certain kind of immortality you know


0:14:50
Speaker 1 :maybe to look around this kind of
 question so first to push back on you said that everyone was cognizant of themortality there's a guy named Ernest
 Becker who would disagree that you basically say that most of humancognition is is created by us trying to
 create an illusion and try to hide the fact that from ourselves the fact thatwe're gonna die to try to think that
 we're it's all gonna go on forever but

0:15:16
Speaker 0 :the fact that we know that it doesn't


0:15:19
Speaker 1 :yes but this mix of denial I mean though
 I think the book is called denial of death is this constant and now thatwe're running away from a that's uh in
 fact some would argue that the inspiration the incredible ideas you'veput out there your TED talk has been
 seen by millions and millions of people right it's just you trying todesperately fight the fact that you are
 biologically immortal and to the your creative genius comes from the fact thatyou're trying to create ideas that live
 on long past you well that's very nice

0:15:52
Speaker 0 :of you I mean I I I would like my ideas
 to live on beyond me because I think that is a good test that those ideashave value have value in the lives of
 others I think that's a good test that that others would continue to talk aboutor share the ideas long after I'm gone
 I think is perhaps the greatest compliment one can get for one's ownwork
 it's very but I don't think it's my awareness of my mortality that drives meto do it it's my desire to contribute
 that drives me to do it this is the

0:16:29
Speaker 1 :Optima it's the optimist vision it's
 it's the the pleasure and the fulfillment you get from inspiringothers it's just as pure as that it's a
 let me ask listen i'm russian i'm trying to get your good and your good i'm gonnaget get you into these dark areas i'm
 enjoying it is the ego tied up into it somehow so your name is extremely wellknown if your name wasn't attached to it
 do you think you would act differently i

0:16:57
Speaker 0 :I mean for years I hated that my name
 was attached to it you know I had a rule for years that I wouldn't have my mymy face on the cover of the front page
 of the website you know I had a fight with the publisher because I didn't wantmy name big on the book I wanted a tiny
 on the book cuz I kept telling them it's not about me it's about the ideas theywanted to put my name at the top of my
 book I refused none of my books had my names on the top because I won'tI won't let them they would like very
 much to put my name on the top of the book but the idea has to be bigger thanme
 I'm not bigger than the idea this

0:17:32
Speaker 1 :beautifully put do you think ego but I


0:17:34
Speaker 0 :also am aware that I've become I'm
 become recognized as the messenger and even though I still think the message isbigger than me I recognize that I have a
 responsibility as the messenger and whether I like it or not is irrelevantI accept I accept the responsibility I'm
 happy to do it

0:17:52
Speaker 1 :I'm not sure how to phrase this but
 there's a large part of the culture right now that emphasizes all the thingsthat nobody disagrees with which is
 health sleep diet relaxation meditation vacation are really important andthere's no you know it's like you can't
 really argue against that in fact people less sleep that's just I'm joking yeswell that's the thing I often I often
 speak to the fact that passion and love for you do what you're doing and the twowords hard work especially in the
 engineering fields are more important than are more important to prioritizeand sleep even though sleep is really
 important your mind should be obsessed with the hard work with the passion andso on and then I get some pushback of
 course from people what would he make sense of that is that just me the thecrazy Russian engineer really pushing


0:18:51
Speaker 0 :hard work probably we yeah I think that
 that's a short-term strategy I think if you sacrifice your health for the workat some point it catches up with you and
 at some point it's like it's like going going going and you get sick your bodywill shut down for you if you refuse to
 to take care of yourself you know it's you get sick it's what happens sometimesyou know more severe illness than
 something that just slows you down so I think I think taking like getting sleepI mean there have been Studies on
 that you know executives for example who get a full night's sleep and stop at areasonable hour actually accomplish more
 are more productive than people who work and burn the midnight oil because theirbrains are working better because
 they're well rested so you know working hard yes but what not work smart I thinkthat giving our minds and our bodies
 rest makes us more efficient I think just driving driving driving driving isa short term so short term strategy so


0:19:51
Speaker 1 :but to push back on that a little bit so
 the annoying thing is you're like a hundred percent right right but thething is it's because because you're
 100% right that weak part of your mind uses that fact to convince you like whatso you know I I get all kinds of my mind
 comes up with all kinds of excuses to try to convince me that I shouldn't bedoing what I'm doing to rationalize to
 rationalize and so what would I have a sense we you I think what you said aboutexecutives and leaders is absolutely
 right but there's the early days the early days of madness and passion forsure then I feel like emphasizing sleep
 as thinking about a sleep as giving yourself away out from the fact thatthose early days especially is can be


0:20:42
Speaker 0 :suffering as long it's not sustainable
 you know right it's not sustainable sure if you're investing all that energy insomething at the beginning to get it up
 and running then at some point you're gonna have to slow down or your bodywill slow you down for you like you you
 can choose your body can choose I mean

0:21:02
Speaker 1 :so okay so you don't think from my
 perspective it feels like people have gotten a little bit soft but you're

0:21:08
Speaker 0 :saying no I think I think that there
 seems evidence that that that working harder and later I've taken a back seatin it I think we have to be careful with
 the broad generalizations but but I think in if you go into the workplacethere are people who would complain that
 that more people now than before you know look at their watches and sayoops five o'clock go by night right now
 is that a problem with the people you're saying it's the people giving themselvesexcuses and people don't work hard or is
 that the organization's aren't giving them something to believe in somethingto be passionate about we can't
 manufacture passion you can't just tell someone be passionate you know it's nothow it works passions and output not an
 input like if I believe in something and I want to contribute all that energy todo it we call that passion you know
 working hard for something we love is passion working hard for something wedon't care about it's called stress but
 we're working hard either way so I think I think the organization's bears someaccountability and our leaders bear some
 accountability which is if they're not offering a sense of purpose if they'renot offering us a sense of cause if
 they're not telling us that our work is worth more than simply the money itmakes then yeah I'm gonna come at five
 o'clock because I don't really care about making you money remember we livein a world right now where a lot of
 people rather a few people are getting rich on the hard work of others and so Ithink when when when people look up and
 say well why would I do that I'll just if you're not gonna look afterme and then you're gonna lay me off at
 the end of the year because you missed your arbitrary projections you knowyou're gonna lay me off because you
 missed your arbitrary projections then why would I be offer my hard work andloyalty to you so I think I don't think
 we can immediately blame people for going soft I think we can blame leadersfor their inability or failure to offer
 their people something bigger than them making a product or making money yeah

0:23:02
Speaker 1 :that's so that's that's brilliant and
 start with why leaders elast your books you kind of you but you basically talkabout what it what it takes to be a good
 leader and so some of the blame should go on the leader but how much of it ison finding your passion how much is it
 on the individual and allowing yourself to pursue that passion pushing yourselfto your limits to to really take
 concrete steps along your path towards that passion yeah there's mutual

0:23:33
Speaker 0 :responsibility there's mutual
 accountability I mean we we're responsible as individuals to find theorganization's and find the leaders that
 inspire us and organizations are responsible for maintaining that flameand
 and giving people who believe but they believed you know a chance to contribute

0:23:50
Speaker 1 :to linger on it have you by chance seen
 the movie whiplash yes again maybe I'm romanticizing suffering again it's the

0:23:59
Speaker 0 :Russian in you it's the Russian yeah the
 Russians love suffering but so but

0:24:04
Speaker 1 :people who haven't seen it's the movie
 whiplash as a drum instructor that pushes the drum musician to to hislimits to to bring out the best in him
 and there's a toxic nature to it and they're suffering in it like you'veyou've worked a lot of great leaders a
 lot of great individuals so what is that toxic relationship as toxic as itappears in the movie or is that
 fundamental I've seen that relationship especially in the past with Olympicathletes with especially in the Flett
 extreme performers seem to do wonders it does wonders for me there's some of themare my best relationships now I'm not
 representative of everyone something for some of my best relationships formauntie and mentor have been toxic from
 an external perspective I what do you make of that movie would he make of thatkind of relationship but it's not my


0:25:00
Speaker 0 :favorite movie okay so you don't think


0:25:03
Speaker 1 :that's a healthy you don't think that
 kind of relationship is a great example

0:25:11
Speaker 0 :of a great short term strategy I mean
 short term I mean look being hard on someone is not the same as toxicity youknow you know if you go to the Marine
 Corps your drill instructor will be very hard and on their Marines and then butstill even on the last day of boot camp
 they'll take their hat off and they'll become a human but the the of all thedrill instructors that you know the the
 the fur the the three or four main but drill instructors assigned to a group ofrecruits the one that they all want the
 respect of is the one that's the hardest on them that's that's true and you hearyou know there's plenty of stories of
 people who want to earn the respect of a hard parent or a hard teacher butfundamental that parent that teacher
 that drill instructor has to believe in that person has to see potentialit's not it's not a formula which is if
 I'm hard on people they'll do well which is there has to still be love it has tobe done with absolute love and it has to
 be done with it has to be done responsibly I mean some people can takea little more pressure than others but
 it's not I don't I think it's irresponsible to think of it as aformula but that I'm just toxic at
 people they will they will do well it depends on their personalities first ofall that works for some but not all and
 and second of all it it can't be done willy-nilly it has to still be done withwith care and love and and sometimes you
 could get equal or better results without all of the toxicity so so one of

0:26:38
Speaker 1 :the I guess toxicity on my part was a
 really bad word to use but if we talk about what makes a good leader and justlook at an example in particular looking
 at Elon Musk he's known to put push people to the limits in a way that Ithink really challenges people in a way
 they've never been challenged before to do the impossible sure but it can really

0:27:07
Speaker 0 :break people and and jobs was hard and
 and Amazon is hard and you know but the thing that's important is none of themlie about it you know the you know
 people ask me about Amazon all the time like Jeff Bezos never lied about it youknow even the ones who like Amazon don't
 last more than a couple years before they burn out but when we're honestabout the culture then it gives people
 the opportunity who like to work in that kind of culture to choose to work inthat kind of culture as opposed to
 pretending and saying oh no this is all you know it's all lovey-lovey here andthen you show up and it's it's the
 furthest thing from it so I mean if you know I think the the reputations areputting a lot of pressure on people to
 you know jobs jobs was not an easy man to work forhe pushed people but everyone who worked
 there was given the space to create and do things that they would not have beenable to do anywhere else and work at a
 level that they didn't work anywhere else and and jobs didn't have all theanswers I mean he pushed his people to
 to come up with answers he he he he wasn't just looking for people toexecute his ideas and and people did
 people accomplished more than they thought they were capable of which iswonderful


0:28:12
Speaker 1 :how do you you're talking about the
 infinite game and not thinking about to short-term and yet you see some of themost brilliant people in the world being
 pushed by a llamas to accomplish some of the most incredible things when we'retalking about autopilot one we're
 talking about some of the hardware engineering and they they do some of thebest work of their life and then leave
 how do you balance that in terms of what it takes to be a good leader what ittakes to accomplish great things in your
 life yeah so I think there's a

0:28:45
Speaker 0 :difference between someone who can get a
 lot about it get a lot out of people in the short term and building anorganization that can sustain beyond any
 individual there's a difference when you

0:28:58
Speaker 1 :say beyond any individual you mean
 beyond beyond like if the leader dies

0:29:03
Speaker 0 :correct like could could Tesla continue
 to do what it's doing without Elon Musk you know and could and you're perhaps

0:29:08
Speaker 1 :implying which is a very interesting
 question that he cannot I don't know you

0:29:13
Speaker 0 :know the argument you're making of this
 this this person who pushes everyone arguably is not a not a repeatable modelright you know is Apple the same without
 Steve Jobs or is it slowly moving in a different direction or has heestablished something that could be
 resurrected with the right leader that

0:29:34
Speaker 1 :was his dream I think it's to have or to
 build an organization that lives on beyond them at least I remember I think

0:29:41
Speaker 0 :that's what a lot of leaders desire
 which is to create something that was bigger than them you know mostbusinesses most entrepreneurial ventures
 could not pass the school bus test which is if the founder was hit by school buswould everyone continue the business
 without them or were they all just go find jobs and the vast majority ofcompanies would fail that test you know
 in in in in especially in the entrepreneurial world that if you takethe inspired visionary leader away the
 whole thing collapses so is that a business or is that just a force ofpersonality and a lot of entrepreneurs
 you know face that reality which is they have to be in every meeting make everydecision you know come up with every
 idea because if they don't who will and the question is well what have youdone to build your bench is it it's not
 sometimes its ego the belief that only I can sometimes it's just things got didso well for so long that just forgot and
 sometimes it's a failure to build the training programs or or hire the rightpeople that that could replace you who
 are maybe smarter and better and browbeating people is only one strategyI don't think it's necessarily the only
 strategy nor is it always the best strategyI think people people get to choose the
 cultures they want to work in so this is why I think I think companies should behonest about the kind of culture that
 they've created you know I heard a story about Apple where some somebody came infrom a big company you know he'd
 accomplished a lot and has ego was very large and he was going on about how hedid this and he did that and he did this
 and he did that and somebody from Apple said we don't care what you've done thequestion is what are you gonna do and
 that's that's you know for somebody who wants to be pushed that's the place yougo because you choose to be pushed now
 we all want to be pushed to some degree you know anybody who wants to yeah youknow accomplish anything in this world
 wants to be pushed to some degree whether it's through self pressure orexternal pressure or you know public
 pressure whatever it is but I think this this whole idea of one size fits all isa false narrative of how leadership
 works but what all leadership requires is creating an environment in whichpeople can work at their natural best


0:32:11
Speaker 1 :but you have you have a sense that it's
 possible to create a business where it lives on beyond you know fee if we lookat now if we just look at this current
 moment I just recently talked to Jack Dorsey CEO of Twitter and he's under alot of pressure now don't know if you're
 aware of the news that he's being pushed out as in potential as the CEO ofTwitter because he's the CEO of already
 of an incredibly successful company plus he wants to go to Africato live a few months in Africa to to
 connect with the world that's outside of the Silicon Valley and sort of there'sthis idea well can Twitter live without


0:32:49
Speaker 0 :jack we'll find out but you have a


0:32:50
Speaker 1 :general as a student of great leadership
 you have a general sense that it's possible yeah of course it's possible I

0:32:58
Speaker 0 :mean what Bill Gates built with
 Microsoft may not have survived Steve Ballmer if the company weren't so richbut such a nerd Allah is putting it back
 on an on track again it's become a visionary company again it's attractinggreat talent again it went through a
 period where they couldn't get better the best talent and the best talent wasleaving now people want to work for
 Microsoft again well that's not because of pressure Ballmer put more pressure onpeople mainly to hit numbers than
 anything else that didn't work yes right and so the question is what kind ofpressure are we putting on people we're
 putting on pressure people to hit numbers or hit hit arbitrary deadlinesor putting on pressure on people because
 we believe that they can do better work and the work that we're trying to do isto advance a vision that's bigger than
 all of us and if you're gonna put pressure on people it better be for theright reason like if you're gonna put
 pressure on me it better be for a worthwhile reason if it's just to hit agoal if it's just to hit some arbitrary
 date or some arbitrary number or make a stock price hit some target you can keepit I'm out of here
 yes but if you want to put pressure on me because we are are we are brothersand sisters-in-arms working to advance a
 cause bigger than ourselves that we believe whatever we're gonna build willsignificantly contribute to the greater
 good of society then go ahead I'll take the pressure and if you look at theapples and you look at the the the the
 the the Elon Musk's you know the jobs in the Elan musk they fundamentally believethat what they were doing would improve
 Society and and it was for the good of humankind and so the pressure in otherwords the the the what they were doing
 was more important more valuable than any individual in the team and so thepressure they put on people served a
 greater good and so we we we we looked to the left and we looked to the rightto each other and said we're in this
 together we accept this we want this but if it's just pressureto hit a number or you know make the
 widget and move a little faster yeah and that's soul-sucking that's notpassion that's stress and I think a lot
 of leaders confuse that making people work hard is not what makes thempassionate giving them something to
 believe in and work on is what drives passion and when you have that then
