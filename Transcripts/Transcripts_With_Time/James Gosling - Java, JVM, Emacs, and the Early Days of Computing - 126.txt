Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 james gosling the founder and lead designer behind the java programminglanguage
 which in many indices is the most popular programming language in theworld
 or is always at least in the top two or threewe only had a limited time for this
 conversation but i'm sure we'll talk again several times in this podcastquick summary of the sponsors public

 with which i first learned object oriented programmingand with it the art and science of
 software engineering also early on in my undergraduateeducation i took a
 course on concurrent programming with javalooking back at that time before i fell
 in love with neural networks the art of parallel computing was bothalgorithmically
 and philosophically fascinating to me the concept of a computer in my mindbefore then was something that does one
 thing at a time the idea that we could create anabstraction of parallelism where you
 could do many things at the same time while still guaranteeing stability andcorrectness was beautiful
 while some folks in college took drugs to expand their mindi took concurrent programming if you

 there's a simplicity to it that to me focuses my mindon the most important bits of every
 moment of every day pulling only at the thread of theessential in all that life has to throw

 that the square root of two is your favorite irrational number

0:04:49
Speaker 0 :i have no idea where that got started


0:04:53
Speaker 1 :um is there any truth to it is there
 anything in mathematics or numbers that you find beautifuloh well there's lots of things in in


0:05:00
Speaker 0 :math that's


0:05:03
Speaker 1 :really beautiful um you know i


0:05:05
Speaker 0 :i used to consider myself really good at
 math and these days i consider myself

0:05:11
Speaker 1 :really bad at math


0:05:13
Speaker 0 :i never had really had a thing for the


0:05:15
Speaker 1 :square root of two


0:05:16
Speaker 0 :

0:05:18
Speaker 1 :but when i was a teenager


0:05:21
Speaker 0 :there was this book called the the
 dictionary of curious and interesting

0:05:24
Speaker 1 :numbers


0:05:28
Speaker 0 :which for some reason i


0:05:30
Speaker 1 :read through and damn near memorized the


0:05:33
Speaker 0 :

0:05:34
Speaker 1 :whole thing


0:05:37
Speaker 0 :and i started this weird habit


0:05:41
Speaker 1 :of when i was like filling out


0:05:43
Speaker 0 :checks you know or you know paying for
 things with credit cards i would want to make the the receipt add

0:05:54
Speaker 1 :up to an interesting number
 is there some numbers that stuck with you that just kind of make you feel good

0:06:00
Speaker 0 :they all have a story and fortunately
 i've actually mostly forgotten all of them

0:06:05
Speaker 1 :um are they uh so like 42


0:06:10
Speaker 0 :uh well yeah i mean that one 42 is
 pretty magical

0:06:14
Speaker 1 :and then the irrationals i mean but is
 there a square root or two

0:06:19
Speaker 0 :story in there somewhere well it's
 it's like the only number that has destroyed a religion

0:06:26
Speaker 1 :

0:06:27
Speaker 0 :in which way well the the
 pathagorians they they believed that all numbers were perfect and you couldrepresent anything as as a as a rational


0:06:38
Speaker 1 :number
 and [Music]

0:06:45
Speaker 0 :

0:06:45
Speaker 1 :in that in that time period


0:06:49
Speaker 0 :um the this proof came out


0:06:51
Speaker 1 :that there was no


0:06:55
Speaker 0 :you know rational fraction whose value
 was equal to the square root of two

0:06:59
Speaker 1 :and that that means nothing in this
 world is perfect not even mathematics

0:07:05
Speaker 0 :well it it means that your definition of
 perfect was imperfect

0:07:10
Speaker 1 :well then then there's the ghetto and
 completeness theorems in the 20th century that ruined it once again

0:07:17
Speaker 0 :for everybody yeah although although
 although

0:07:19
Speaker 1 :girdle's theorem um


0:07:24
Speaker 0 :you know the lesson i take from girdle's
 theorem is not that

0:07:27
Speaker 1 :you know there are things you can't know
 which

0:07:31
Speaker 0 :is fundamentally what it says um


0:07:34
Speaker 1 :

0:07:36
Speaker 0 :but you know people want black and white
 answers

0:07:38
Speaker 1 :they want true or false


0:07:42
Speaker 0 :um but if you if you allow a three-state


0:07:45
Speaker 1 :logic


0:07:48
Speaker 0 :

0:07:48
Speaker 1 :that is true false or maybe
 then then life's good i feel like there's a parallel to uhmodern political discourse in there
 somewhere but yeah let me let me askum so with your kind of
 early love or appreciation of the beauty of mathematicsdo you see a parallel between that world
 and the world of programming you know programming isall about logical structure


0:08:22
Speaker 0 :understanding the the patterns


0:08:25
Speaker 1 :

0:08:28
Speaker 0 :that um come out of


0:08:30
Speaker 1 :computation understanding


0:08:32
Speaker 0 :

0:08:33
Speaker 1 :sort of i mean it's often


0:08:36
Speaker 0 :like you know the path through the graph
 of possibilities

0:08:40
Speaker 1 :to find a short a short route
 meaning like uh find a short program that gets the job doneyeah kind of thing but uh so then on the
 topic of irrational numbers do you see dc programmingyou just painted it so cleanly uh it's a
 little this trajectory to find like a nice little program butdo you see it as fundamentally messy
 maybe unlike mathematics i don't think

0:09:10
Speaker 0 :of it as
 i mean i mean you know you watch somebody who's good at math do

0:09:15
Speaker 1 :math and you know often


0:09:19
Speaker 0 :it's it's fairly messy sometimes it's
 kind of

0:09:24
Speaker 1 :magical um


0:09:27
Speaker 0 :

0:09:29
Speaker 1 :when i was a grad student


0:09:32
Speaker 0 :um one of the students his name was jim


0:09:33
Speaker 1 :sax
 was he had this this this this this reputation of being sort of a

0:09:42
Speaker 0 :walking talking human uh theorem proving


0:09:47
Speaker 1 :

0:09:48
Speaker 0 :machine
 and if you were having a hard problem with something you could just likeaccost him in the hall
 and say jim and and he would do this this this funnything where he would
 stand up straight his eyes would kind of defocus he'dgo uh you know just just like get you
 know like like something in today's moviesand then you straighten up and say and
 log in and walk away and and and you go well okay so n log nis the answer how did he


0:10:21
Speaker 1 :get there


0:10:23
Speaker 0 :by which time he's you know down the
 hallway somewhere yeah

0:10:26
Speaker 1 :it is just the the oracle the black box
 just gives you the answer

0:10:31
Speaker 0 :yeah and then you have to figure out the


0:10:34
Speaker 1 :path from the question to the answer
 i think in one of the videos i watched you mentioneduh don knuth uh well
 at least recommending his uh you know his his bookis something people should read oh yeah
 but in terms of you know theoretical computer sciencedo you do you see something beautiful in
 in that has been inspiring to you speakingof n log n
 in your work on programming languages that's in the in that whole world ofalgorithms and complexity
 and you know these kinds of more formal mathematical thingsum or did that not really
 stick with you in your programming life it did stick pretty clearly for me

0:11:23
Speaker 0 :because
 one of the things that i care about is

0:11:27
Speaker 1 :being able to


0:11:32
Speaker 0 :

0:11:33
Speaker 1 :sort of look at a piece of code and and


0:11:36
Speaker 0 :be able to prove to myself that it works


0:11:38
Speaker 1 :um you know and


0:11:43
Speaker 0 :you know so so for example i find that


0:11:46
Speaker 1 :um


0:11:49
Speaker 0 :i'm i'm at odds with many of the people


0:11:53
Speaker 1 :around me


0:11:55
Speaker 0 :over um issues about like


0:11:56
Speaker 1 :how you lay out a piece of software


0:12:01
Speaker 0 :right you know so so software engineers
 get really cranky about how they format their thedocuments that are the programs you know
 where they put new lines and where they put you know the bracesthe braces and all the rest of that


0:12:17
Speaker 1 :right
 and i tend to go

0:12:21
Speaker 0 :for a style that's very dense


0:12:24
Speaker 1 :to minimize the white space um yeah well


0:12:31
Speaker 0 :to maximize the amount that i can see


0:12:35
Speaker 1 :

0:12:36
Speaker 0 :at once right so i like to be able to
 see a whole function and to understand whatit does
 rather than have to go scroll scroll scroll and remember right yeah

0:12:45
Speaker 1 :i'm with you on that yeah that's and
 people don't like that

0:12:52
Speaker 0 :yeah i've i've had i've had you know
 multiple times when

0:12:57
Speaker 1 :engineering teams have uh staged


0:13:00
Speaker 0 :what was effectively an intervention


0:13:03
Speaker 1 :

0:13:06
Speaker 0 :um you know where they they invite me to
 a meeting and everybody's arrived before me and they so all look at me and sayjames about your coding style


0:13:17
Speaker 1 :i'm sort of an odd person to be


0:13:22
Speaker 0 :

0:13:25
Speaker 1 :programming because i don't think


0:13:27
Speaker 0 :

0:13:28
Speaker 1 :very well verbally um


0:13:33
Speaker 0 :i am just naturally a slow reader


0:13:34
Speaker 1 :

0:13:37
Speaker 0 :um i'm what most people would call


0:13:40
Speaker 1 :a visual thinker so when you think about
 a program what do you what do you see i see pictures right so

0:13:47
Speaker 0 :when i look at a piece of code on a
 piece of paper

0:13:51
Speaker 1 :

0:13:52
Speaker 0 :it very quickly gets transformed into a


0:13:54
Speaker 1 :picture


0:13:57
Speaker 0 :um and you know it's almost like a piece


0:14:00
Speaker 1 :of machinery with


0:14:03
Speaker 0 :you know this connected to that and like
 these gear knobs yeah yeah i i see them moremore like that than i see the the
 the sort of verbal structure or the lexical structure ofof letters so then when you look at the


0:14:18
Speaker 1 :program that's why you want to see it
 all in the same place then you could just mapit to something visual yeah and just


0:14:24
Speaker 0 :kind of like like it leaps off the page
 at me and

0:14:27
Speaker 1 :yeah what are the inputs where the
 outputs what the heck is this thing doing yeahand yeah getting a whole vision of it
 can we uh go back into your memory memorylong-term memory access what's the first
 program you've ever written

0:14:48
Speaker 0 :oh i have no idea what the first one was


0:14:50
Speaker 1 :

0:14:52
Speaker 0 :i mean i i know the first machine that i
 learned that i learned to program on

0:14:57
Speaker 1 :

0:14:57
Speaker 0 :what is it was a


0:15:00
Speaker 1 :pdp-8


0:15:02
Speaker 0 :um at the university of calgary


0:15:04
Speaker 1 :

0:15:07
Speaker 0 :do you remember the specs oh yeah so
 so the thing had 4k of ram

0:15:11
Speaker 1 :nice 12-bit words


0:15:16
Speaker 0 :

0:15:17
Speaker 1 :the clock rate was um
 it was about a third of a megahertz oh so i didn't even get to the to the m

0:15:27
Speaker 0 :okay yeah
 yeah so you know we're we're like 10 000 times faster these days

0:15:35
Speaker 1 :um and was this kind of like a super
 computer like a serious computer

0:15:41
Speaker 0 :for no the pdp 8i was the
 the first thing that people were calling like mini computer

0:15:48
Speaker 1 :

0:15:51
Speaker 0 :got it they were sort of inexpensive
 enough that a university lab could maybe afford

0:15:57
Speaker 1 :to buy one
 and was there time sharing all that kind

0:16:01
Speaker 0 :of stuff um there there actually was a
 time sharing os

0:16:04
Speaker 1 :for that but it wasn't


0:16:07
Speaker 0 :used really widely the machine that i
 learned on was one that was kind of hidden in the

0:16:16
Speaker 1 :back corner


0:16:17
Speaker 0 :of the of the computer center


0:16:19
Speaker 1 :um and it was


0:16:24
Speaker 0 :it was bought as a as part of a
 um project to do computer networking

0:16:31
Speaker 1 :um but


0:16:37
Speaker 0 :you know they didn't actually use it
 very much it was mostly just kind of

0:16:40
Speaker 1 :sitting there


0:16:42
Speaker 0 :and it was kind of sitting there and i
 noticed it was just kind of sitting there and

0:16:48
Speaker 1 :so i started fooling around with it and


0:16:51
Speaker 0 :nobody seemed to mind so i just kept


0:16:53
Speaker 1 :doing that and
 i had a keyboard and like a monitor

0:16:58
Speaker 0 :oh this is way before monitors were
 common so it was it was literally a a model 33teletype


0:17:09
Speaker 1 :okay with a paper tape reader
 okay so the user interface wasn't very

0:17:13
Speaker 0 :good yeah
 yeah it was it was the first computer ever

0:17:18
Speaker 1 :built with integrated circuits


0:17:22
Speaker 0 :but by integrated circuits i mean that
 they would have

0:17:26
Speaker 1 :like 10 or 12 transistors


0:17:28
Speaker 0 :

0:17:30
Speaker 1 :on one piece of silicon right not the 10


0:17:31
Speaker 0 :or 12


0:17:34
Speaker 1 :billion that machines have today
 so what did that i mean feel like if you remember thosei mean did you have kind of inklings of
 the the magic of exponential kind ofimprovement of moore's law
 of the potential of the future that was at your fingertips kind of thing oh itwas


0:17:58
Speaker 0 :just a cool yeah it was just a toy
 you know i had always liked building

0:18:02
Speaker 1 :stuff


0:18:04
Speaker 0 :but one of the problems with building
 stuff is that you need to have parts you know you need to have piecesof wood or wire


0:18:12
Speaker 1 :or switches or stuff like that and those
 all cost money

0:18:17
Speaker 0 :and here you could build you could build
 arbitrarily complicated things and i didn't need any physical materials

0:18:23
Speaker 1 :

0:18:25
Speaker 0 :um it required no money that's right


0:18:27
Speaker 1 :it's a good way to put
 programming you're right it's uh if you love building thingsit uh okay so it you know completely
 accessible you don't need anything and anybody fromanywhere could just build something
 really cool

0:18:41
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah if you've got access to a
 computer you can you can build all kinds of crazy stuff

0:18:48
Speaker 1 :um and


0:18:53
Speaker 0 :you know and when you were somebody like


0:18:58
Speaker 1 :me who had like really no money
 um and i mean i

0:19:04
Speaker 0 :i remember just lusting after being able
 to buy like

0:19:10
Speaker 1 :a transistor


0:19:13
Speaker 0 :um you know and when i would do
 sort of electronics kind of projects they were mostly made

0:19:21
Speaker 1 :

0:19:23
Speaker 0 :done by like dumpster diving for trash


0:19:25
Speaker 1 :

0:19:27
Speaker 0 :you know and you know one of my big
 hauls was uh discarded relay racks from the backof a
 the phone company switching center oh

0:19:37
Speaker 1 :nice
 that was the big memorable treasure oh

0:19:40
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah


0:19:43
Speaker 1 :that was what do you use that for i i


0:19:44
Speaker 0 :

0:19:46
Speaker 1 :built a machine that played tic-tac-toe


0:19:50
Speaker 0 :nice out of relays of course the thing


0:19:53
Speaker 1 :that was really hard


0:19:55
Speaker 0 :um was that all the relays required a


0:19:58
Speaker 1 :specific voltage


0:19:59
Speaker 0 :but getting a power supply that will
 would do that voltage was pretty hard andsince i had a bunch of trashed


0:20:08
Speaker 1 :television sets i had to
 um sort of cobble together something

0:20:14
Speaker 0 :

0:20:16
Speaker 1 :that was
 wrong but worked um

0:20:20
Speaker 0 :so i was actually running these relays


0:20:24
Speaker 1 :at 300 volts


0:20:25
Speaker 0 :and and none of the electrical
 connections were

0:20:32
Speaker 1 :like properly sealed off
 you survived that period of your life oh

0:20:36
Speaker 0 :for so many reasons
 for so many reasons i mean you know you'reyou know it's pretty common for teenage
 geeks to discover oh thermite that's real easy to

0:20:48
Speaker 1 :make
 yeah well i'm glad you did but do you remember thedo you remember what program in calgary
 that you wrote anything that stands out and what language

0:21:03
Speaker 0 :well so mostly the


0:21:08
Speaker 1 :anything of any size was
 assembly code um

0:21:15
Speaker 0 :and actually before i learned assembly
 code there was this programming language on the pdp called

0:21:20
Speaker 1 :focal five


0:21:22
Speaker 0 :and focal five was kind of like a really
 stripped down

0:21:25
Speaker 1 :fortran and


0:21:29
Speaker 0 :i remember playing but you know building
 programs that did things like

0:21:35
Speaker 1 :um play blackjack um
 [Music] or solitaire or for some reason or the

0:21:41
Speaker 0 :things that
 i really liked were ones where they were just like

0:21:48
Speaker 1 :plotting graphs so something with
 uh like a function or a data and then you'd plot ityeah yeah i did a bunches of those


0:21:57
Speaker 0 :things and
 went ooh pretty pictures um

0:22:02
Speaker 1 :and so this would like print out again
 no

0:22:06
Speaker 0 :no monitors right so it was like


0:22:09
Speaker 1 :on a teletype yeah


0:22:12
Speaker 0 :so using something that's kind of like a
 a typewriter and then using those

0:22:20
Speaker 1 :to plot functions so when i apologize to
 romanticize things but when did you first fall in love withprogramming you know what was the first
 programming language like it's a serious maybe software engineer where youthought this is a beautiful


0:22:39
Speaker 0 :thing i guess i never really thought of
 any particular language as being like beautiful because it was never reallyabout the language for me it was about


0:22:48
Speaker 1 :what you could do with it
 um and you know even today

0:22:53
Speaker 0 :you know people try to get me into
 arguments about particular forms of syntax for this orthat and i'm like


0:23:01
Speaker 1 :who cares you know it's it's about what


0:23:03
Speaker 0 :you can do
 not not not how you spell the word

0:23:07
Speaker 1 :

0:23:10
Speaker 0 :um and you know so back in those days i
 i learned like pl one and fortran

0:23:17
Speaker 1 :

0:23:18
Speaker 0 :and cobalt and and you know by the time
 that people were willing to hire me to do

0:23:22
Speaker 1 :stuff


0:23:25
Speaker 0 :you know it was mostly assembly code and
 you know pvp assembly code and and

0:23:29
Speaker 1 :fortran code and


0:23:33
Speaker 0 :control data assembly code for like the
 cdc 6400 which was an

0:23:38
Speaker 1 :early i guess super computer


0:23:42
Speaker 0 :even though that super computer has less


0:23:46
Speaker 1 :compute power than my phone
 by a lot and that was mostly like said fortran yeah worldthat said you've also showed
 appreciation for the greatest language um ever that i think everyone agrees islisp


0:24:04
Speaker 0 :um well lisp was definitely on my list
 of the greatest ones that have have um

0:24:10
Speaker 1 :existed is that number one or i mean


0:24:15
Speaker 0 :um are you i mean you know that you know
 the thing is that it's it that you you

0:24:18
Speaker 1 :know


0:24:21
Speaker 0 :i wouldn't put it number one now is it


0:24:23
Speaker 1 :the parentheses what uh
 um what do you love what do you not love about lispum well i guess the number one thing to


0:24:33
Speaker 0 :not love about it is so freaking many
 parentheses yeah um on the on the love thing is you know out of

0:24:43
Speaker 1 :those


0:24:46
Speaker 0 :tons of parentheses you actually get an


0:24:50
Speaker 1 :interesting language structure


0:24:51
Speaker 0 :and i've always thought that there was a
 friendlier version of lisp

0:24:56
Speaker 1 :hiding out there somewhere but i've


0:24:57
Speaker 0 :never really


0:24:59
Speaker 1 :

0:25:00
Speaker 0 :spent much time thinking about thinking
 about it but you know so like like up the food chain

0:25:07
Speaker 1 :for me um then from lisp is


0:25:09
Speaker 0 :

0:25:10
Speaker 1 :

0:25:12
Speaker 0 :simula which a very small number of


0:25:14
Speaker 1 :people have ever used
 but a lot of people i think he had a huge influence rightyeah the programming but in the simula
 i apologize if i'm wrong on this but is that one of the first functionallanguages
 um or no no it was it was it was the

0:25:28
Speaker 0 :first object-oriented programming
 language got it it's really where object-orientedand languages sort of came together


0:25:37
Speaker 1 :

0:25:40
Speaker 0 :um and it was also the
 the language where co routines first

0:25:47
Speaker 1 :showed up as a part of the language


0:25:48
Speaker 0 :so you could have a programming style


0:25:52
Speaker 1 :that was


0:25:53
Speaker 0 :you could think of it as multiple uh
 sort of multi-threaded

0:25:57
Speaker 1 :with a lot of parallel parallelism
 really there's ideas of parallelism in there yeah

0:26:04
Speaker 0 :yeah so that was that was back you know


0:26:10
Speaker 1 :so the first stimulus spec was simula 67


0:26:13
Speaker 0 :like 1967. yeah
 wow so it had it it had co-routines which arealmost threads the the thing about co
 routines is that they don't have true concurrency so you can get away

0:26:28
Speaker 1 :without


0:26:30
Speaker 0 :um really complex locking you can't


0:26:32
Speaker 1 :

0:26:34
Speaker 0 :usably do co-routines on a


0:26:37
Speaker 1 :on the multi-core machine or if you try


0:26:39
Speaker 0 :to do core
 code routines on the multi-core mute

0:26:42
Speaker 1 :

0:26:44
Speaker 0 :machine you
 don't actually get to use the multiple coresum either that or you you know because
 you start then having to get into the universe ofyou know semaphores and locks and things


0:26:57
Speaker 1 :like that


0:27:00
Speaker 0 :um but you know in terms of the
 the style of programming you could

0:27:04
Speaker 1 :

0:27:05
Speaker 0 :write code and think think of it as
 being multi-threaded the mental model

0:27:11
Speaker 1 :

0:27:13
Speaker 0 :was very much a multi-threaded one and


0:27:15
Speaker 1 :

0:27:17
Speaker 0 :all kinds of problems you could approach


0:27:19
Speaker 1 :very differently
 to to return to uh the world of lisp for a brief moment you uh at cmu you'veyou uh wrote a version of emacs
 that i think was very impactful on the history of emacsum what was your motivation


0:27:41
Speaker 0 :for for doing so at that time


0:27:44
Speaker 1 :so that was in like 85 or 86.


0:27:47
Speaker 0 :

0:27:48
Speaker 1 :um i had been using


0:27:53
Speaker 0 :

0:27:54
Speaker 1 :unix for a few years


0:27:59
Speaker 0 :and um most of the editing was
 this this tool called edie um

0:28:04
Speaker 1 :

0:28:04
Speaker 0 :

0:28:07
Speaker 1 :which was sort of an ancestor of vi
 and is it a pretty good editor

0:28:14
Speaker 0 :not a good editor well if if what you're
 using um if your input device is a teletype

0:28:21
Speaker 1 :

0:28:21
Speaker 0 :it's pretty good yeah it's certainly
 more humane than tico which was kind of the the common thingin
 a lot of um the dec universe at the time

0:28:32
Speaker 1 :

0:28:34
Speaker 0 :tico is both tk is that the tico t-e-c-o
 the text editor and corrector corrector

0:28:38
Speaker 1 :huh
 so many features um and the original emacs

0:28:46
Speaker 0 :came out as so emac stands for editor


0:28:51
Speaker 1 :macros


0:28:52
Speaker 0 :and tico had a way of writing macros


0:28:54
Speaker 1 :and so the original um


0:28:59
Speaker 0 :emacs from mit sort of started out as


0:29:04
Speaker 1 :a collection of macros for tico


0:29:06
Speaker 0 :but then you know you know the the sort
 of emac style got got popular originally at

0:29:15
Speaker 1 :at mit and then people


0:29:18
Speaker 0 :did a few other implementations of emacs


0:29:21
Speaker 1 :

0:29:22
Speaker 0 :that were you know the the the code base
 was entirely different but it was sort of the philosophical styleof the original emacs what was the


0:29:30
Speaker 1 :philosophy of emacs and by the way were
 all the implementations always in c and then no and how does lisp fit into

0:29:38
Speaker 0 :the picture
 no so so the very first emacs was written as a bunch of macros for thetico text editor


0:29:48
Speaker 1 :wow this is so interesting and the


0:29:48
Speaker 0 :the the macro language for tico


0:29:51
Speaker 1 :

0:29:52
Speaker 0 :was probably the most ridiculously


0:29:56
Speaker 1 :obscure


0:29:58
Speaker 0 :format you know if you just look at a
 tico program on a on a page you think it was just randomcharacters


0:30:07
Speaker 1 :it really looks like just line noise
 just kind of like latex or something oh

0:30:11
Speaker 0 :worse
 way worse than the tick way way worse

0:30:15
Speaker 1 :

0:30:16
Speaker 0 :than latex
 um but you know if you use tico a lot which i did the the tico was completelyoptimized for touch typing


0:30:28
Speaker 1 :at high speed um


0:30:30
Speaker 0 :so there were no two character commands


0:30:33
Speaker 1 :

0:30:35
Speaker 0 :well there were a few but mostly they
 were just one character so every character on the keyboard was a separate

0:30:41
Speaker 1 :command


0:30:43
Speaker 0 :um and actually every character on the
 keyboard was usually two or three

0:30:48
Speaker 1 :commands because you know you hit shift


0:30:49
Speaker 0 :and control and all of those things you
 know it's just a way of

0:30:55
Speaker 1 :very tightly encoding it and


0:30:56
Speaker 0 :mostly what emacs did was it made that


0:30:59
Speaker 1 :that visual right so


0:31:04
Speaker 0 :one way to think of tico is use emax


0:31:08
Speaker 1 :with your eyes closed


0:31:13
Speaker 0 :where you have to maintain a mental


0:31:16
Speaker 1 :model of


0:31:18
Speaker 0 :you know sort of a mental image of your
 document you have to go okay so the the cursor is

0:31:25
Speaker 1 :between the a and the e


0:31:28
Speaker 0 :and i want to exchange those so i do
 these these things right so it almost it isalmost exactly the emax command set
 well it's roughly approximate roughly the same as emacs command set

0:31:44
Speaker 1 :but using emacs with your eyes closed
 um so what

0:31:48
Speaker 0 :emacs you know part of what emacs added
 to the whole thing was was being able to visually see what you

0:31:57
Speaker 1 :were editing


0:31:58
Speaker 0 :

0:31:59
Speaker 1 :um in a form that matched your document


0:32:05
Speaker 0 :um and you know a lot of things
 changed in the in the command set it um you know because it was programmableit was
 really flexible you could add new commands for all kinds of things

0:32:18
Speaker 1 :

0:32:19
Speaker 0 :and then people rewrote emacs
 like multiple times in lisp there was one done atmit for the lisp machine there was one
 done

0:32:29
Speaker 1 :for multix and one summer i got a


0:32:32
Speaker 0 :got a summer job to work on the


0:32:38
Speaker 1 :pascal compiler for multix


0:32:39
Speaker 0 :and that was actually the first time i


0:32:43
Speaker 1 :used emacs


0:32:45
Speaker 0 :and and and so to write the compilers


0:32:47
Speaker 1 :you've worked in compilers too it's yeah


0:32:51
Speaker 0 :that's fascinating


0:32:52
Speaker 1 :yeah so i did a lot of work you know


0:32:55
Speaker 0 :i mean i spent like like a really
 intense three months working on this pascal compiler umbasically living in emacs and it was
 it was the one written in mac list by

0:33:09
Speaker 1 :bernie greenberg


0:33:11
Speaker 0 :and i thought wow this is a just a way


0:33:15
Speaker 1 :better way to do editing


0:33:19
Speaker 0 :um and then i got back to cmu


0:33:22
Speaker 1 :

0:33:22
Speaker 0 :where we had kind of one of everything


0:33:25
Speaker 1 :

0:33:26
Speaker 0 :and two of a bunch of things and four of


0:33:29
Speaker 1 :a few things and


0:33:31
Speaker 0 :um since i mostly worked in the unix
 universe and unix didn't have an e-max i decidedthat i needed to fix that problem
 so i so i wrote this this implementation of emacs in cbecause at the time c was really the
 only language that worked on

0:33:51
Speaker 1 :on uh on unix
 um and you were comfortable with c as well oh yeah at that point

0:33:59
Speaker 0 :yeah at that time i had done a lot of c


0:34:02
Speaker 1 :coding that this was in like 86.
 um and

0:34:09
Speaker 0 :you know it was running well enough to


0:34:12
Speaker 1 :

0:34:12
Speaker 0 :be used for me to use it to edit itself
 within a

0:34:17
Speaker 1 :month or two and um then it kind of
 took over the university and and it

0:34:23
Speaker 0 :spread
 and then it died yeah and then it went outside theand largely because unix kind of


0:34:32
Speaker 1 :took over the research community


0:34:35
Speaker 0 :on the on the on the arpanet


0:34:36
Speaker 1 :

0:34:38
Speaker 0 :

0:34:39
Speaker 1 :then and emacs was


0:34:42
Speaker 0 :kind of the best editor out there it
 kind of took over and there was a actually a brief period

0:34:48
Speaker 1 :where


0:34:49
Speaker 0 :i actually had login ids on every


0:34:56
Speaker 1 :non-military host on the on the arpanet


0:34:58
Speaker 0 :you know because people would say oh can
 we install this and and i'd like

0:35:02
Speaker 1 :

0:35:03
Speaker 0 :well yeah but you'll need some help


0:35:08
Speaker 1 :uh the days when security wasn't uh when


0:35:11
Speaker 0 :nobody cared nobody cared


0:35:14
Speaker 1 :yeah we can ask briefly
 what were those early days of arpanet and the internetlike what was uh
 what i mean did you uh again sorry for the silly questionbut could you have possibly imagined
 that uh the the internet would look like what it is today

0:35:36
Speaker 0 :you know some of it is remarkably


0:35:39
Speaker 1 :unchanged


0:35:42
Speaker 0 :so like one of the things that i noticed


0:35:45
Speaker 1 :really early on
 um at you know when i was at

0:35:49
Speaker 0 :

0:35:51
Speaker 1 :at carnegie mellon was that


0:35:53
Speaker 0 :a lot of social life


0:35:56
Speaker 1 :

0:35:56
Speaker 0 :became centered around the arpanet


0:35:59
Speaker 1 :

0:36:00
Speaker 0 :so things like you know between email
 and

0:36:04
Speaker 1 :

0:36:05
Speaker 0 :text messaging because the
 you know text messaging was a part of the arpanet really early onthere were no cell phones but you know
 you're sitting at a terminal and you're typing stuff

0:36:16
Speaker 1 :and essentially email or like what what


0:36:19
Speaker 0 :is well just like
 like a one-line message right so so so

0:36:24
Speaker 1 :oh cool so like chat like chat yeah


0:36:26
Speaker 0 :right so it's like like sending a
 one-line message to somebody right

0:36:30
Speaker 1 :and and and so pretty much


0:36:33
Speaker 0 :

0:36:36
Speaker 1 :everything from you know


0:36:38
Speaker 0 :arranging lunch to going out on dates
 you know it was all like driven by social mediaso you know right in the in the in
 the 80s easier than phone calls yeah

0:36:53
Speaker 1 :

0:36:53
Speaker 0 :you know and my life had gotten to where


0:36:58
Speaker 1 :you know i was you know


0:37:00
Speaker 0 :living on social media you know from


0:37:04
Speaker 1 :like
 the early mid 80s um and

0:37:13
Speaker 0 :and so when when it sort of transformed
 into the internet and social media explodes i was kind oflike
 what's the big deal it's just a scale

0:37:21
Speaker 1 :

0:37:22
Speaker 0 :thing
 it's it's right the the scale thing is just

0:37:27
Speaker 1 :astonishing yeah um but the fundamentals


0:37:31
Speaker 0 :um in some ways the fundamentals have
 have hardly changed and you know the the technologies behind thethe networking have changed
 significantly the

0:37:43
Speaker 1 :

0:37:43
Speaker 0 :you know the the the watershed moment of
 you know going from the arpanet to the

0:37:50
Speaker 1 :internet
 um and then people starting to just

0:37:53
Speaker 0 :scale and scale and scale i mean the


0:37:57
Speaker 1 :

0:38:00
Speaker 0 :the the the scaling that happened in the
 early 90s

0:38:03
Speaker 1 :and the way that


0:38:07
Speaker 0 :so many vested interests fought the


0:38:10
Speaker 1 :internet
 oh who oh interesting what was the oh because you can't really control the

0:38:17
Speaker 0 :internet yeah
 so so so fundamentally the

0:38:22
Speaker 1 :

0:38:24
Speaker 0 :you know the cable tv companies and
 broadcasters

0:38:27
Speaker 1 :and phone companies um


0:38:32
Speaker 0 :you know at the deepest fibers of their
 being

0:38:36
Speaker 1 :they hated the internet but


0:38:38
Speaker 0 :

0:38:41
Speaker 1 :it was often kind of a funny thing
 because um

0:38:49
Speaker 0 :you know so so so think of a cable


0:38:50
Speaker 1 :company


0:38:54
Speaker 0 :right most of the employees of the cable


0:38:55
Speaker 1 :company


0:38:57
Speaker 0 :

0:38:57
Speaker 1 :their job is getting


0:39:00
Speaker 0 :tv shows movies whatever


0:39:05
Speaker 1 :out to their customers they view their


0:39:06
Speaker 0 :business


0:39:08
Speaker 1 :as serving their customers


0:39:14
Speaker 0 :um but as you climb up the hierarchy
 in the in the cable companies

0:39:19
Speaker 1 :that view shifts because
 um really

0:39:27
Speaker 0 :

0:39:29
Speaker 1 :the business of the cable companies


0:39:32
Speaker 0 :that had always been selling eyeballs to


0:39:34
Speaker 1 :advertisers
 right um

0:39:41
Speaker 0 :and you know that view of


0:39:45
Speaker 1 :of like a cable company didn't really


0:39:47
Speaker 0 :dawn on most people who worked at the


0:39:50
Speaker 1 :cable companies


0:39:51
Speaker 0 :but i mean you know we you know i had
 various dust-ups with various cable companies where you couldsee you know in the stratified layers of
 the corporation that that this this this this this view ofyou know the reason that you have you
 know cable tv is to capture eyeballs

0:40:11
Speaker 1 :you know there they didn't see it that


0:40:14
Speaker 0 :way well so so the people who
 the most the people who worked at the phone companyare at the cable companies their view


0:40:21
Speaker 1 :

0:40:23
Speaker 0 :was that their
 their job was getting delightful content out to their customersand their customers would pay for them


0:40:31
Speaker 1 :would pay for that


0:40:34
Speaker 0 :higher up they viewed this as as a way
 of

0:40:38
Speaker 1 :attracting eyeballs to them


0:40:42
Speaker 0 :and and then what they were really doing
 was selling

0:40:46
Speaker 1 :the eyeballs that were glued to their


0:40:50
Speaker 0 :content
 to the advertising to the advertisers

0:40:52
Speaker 1 :yeah
 and so the internet was a competition in

0:40:56
Speaker 0 :that sense right
 and and and and they were right well yeah um i mean there was oneproposal that we sent the
 the we one detailed proposal that that

0:41:10
Speaker 1 :we


0:41:12
Speaker 0 :um wrote up you know back at that sun
 in the in the early 90s that was essentially likelook anybody you know with it with
 internet technologies anybody can become provider

0:41:25
Speaker 1 :

0:41:26
Speaker 0 :of of content so you know


0:41:30
Speaker 1 :you could be distributing home movies to
 your parents

0:41:35
Speaker 0 :or your cousins or your who are anywhere
 else right so anybody can become a publisher wow you

0:41:41
Speaker 1 :were thinking about that already yeah


0:41:43
Speaker 0 :yeah that was like yeah that was
 that that was like in the in the early

0:41:48
Speaker 1 :90s yeah


0:41:50
Speaker 0 :and we thought this would be great


0:41:51
Speaker 1 :

0:41:52
Speaker 0 :you could you know and the kind of
 content we were thinking about at the time was

0:41:58
Speaker 1 :

0:41:59
Speaker 0 :like you know home movies kids essays


0:42:01
Speaker 1 :um you know stuff from


0:42:07
Speaker 0 :like grocery stores or you know you know
 that or or a restaurant that they couldactually
 like start sending information about

0:42:17
Speaker 1 :out and um


0:42:21
Speaker 0 :that's brilliant and and the the the the
 reaction of the cable companies was

0:42:25
Speaker 1 :like no because
 because then we're out of business

0:42:33
Speaker 0 :

0:42:35
Speaker 1 :what is it about companies that because
 they could have just they could have been ahead of that wavethey could have listened to that


0:42:41
Speaker 0 :and they could have they they didn't see


0:42:43
Speaker 1 :a path to revenue
 you know there's there's somewhere in there there's a lesson for likebig companies right like to to listen
 to to try to anticipate the the renegade the out there out of the boxpeople like yourself in the early days
 writing proposals about what this could possibly be well and

0:43:03
Speaker 0 :

0:43:05
Speaker 1 :that you know that you know it wasn't


0:43:06
Speaker 0 :you know if you're in a in a position


0:43:09
Speaker 1 :where you're making


0:43:10
Speaker 0 :truckloads of money off of a particular


0:43:15
Speaker 1 :business model
 um you you know the

0:43:18
Speaker 0 :the the the the whole um
 thought of like you know leaping the chasmright you know you know you can see oh


0:43:28
Speaker 1 :new models


0:43:31
Speaker 0 :that are more effective are emerging


0:43:33
Speaker 1 :

0:43:35
Speaker 0 :right so like digital cameras versus


0:43:38
Speaker 1 :film cameras
 um you know i mean why take the leap

0:43:43
Speaker 0 :why take the leap because you're making
 so much money

0:43:48
Speaker 1 :off of film and


0:43:54
Speaker 0 :um you know in my past at sun
 one of our big customers was kodak and i ended upinteracting with folks from kodak quite
 a lot and they actually had a

0:44:05
Speaker 1 :big um


0:44:08
Speaker 0 :digital camera research and you know
 digital imaging business or b development group

0:44:14
Speaker 1 :and they knew


0:44:19
Speaker 0 :that that you know you you know you just
 look at the at the trend lines and you look at umyou know the emerging quality of


0:44:29
Speaker 1 :

0:44:29
Speaker 0 :of of these you know digital cameras


0:44:32
Speaker 1 :

0:44:34
Speaker 0 :and you know you can just plot it on the
 graph

0:44:38
Speaker 1 :you know and it's like you know sure


0:44:40
Speaker 0 :

0:44:42
Speaker 1 :film is better today
 but you know

0:44:47
Speaker 0 :digital is is is is improving like this


0:44:52
Speaker 1 :the lines are going to cross and and you


0:44:53
Speaker 0 :know the point at which the lines cross
 is going to be a collapse in their

0:44:59
Speaker 1 :business
 and they could see that

0:45:05
Speaker 0 :right they absolutely knew that the
 problem is that you know up to the point where they hit the wall

0:45:11
Speaker 1 :

0:45:12
Speaker 0 :they were making truckloads of money


0:45:14
Speaker 1 :yeah


0:45:18
Speaker 0 :right and when they did the math


0:45:19
Speaker 1 :

0:45:23
Speaker 0 :um it never started to make sense for
 them to

0:45:28
Speaker 1 :kind of lead the charge and


0:45:29
Speaker 0 :part of the issues for a lot of
 companies for this kind of stuff

0:45:33
Speaker 1 :

0:45:35
Speaker 0 :is that um you know if you're going to
 leap over a chasm like that like like with

0:45:42
Speaker 1 :kodak going from from film to digital


0:45:45
Speaker 0 :that's a transition that's going to take


0:45:47
Speaker 1 :a while


0:45:49
Speaker 0 :right we have we had fights like this
 with people over like smart carts

0:45:54
Speaker 1 :the smart cards fights were just
 ludicrous but that's where visionary leadershipcomes in right yeah somebody needs to
 roll in and say then take to take the leap well it's

0:46:04
Speaker 0 :it's partly take the leap but it's also
 partly take the hit

0:46:09
Speaker 1 :

0:46:10
Speaker 0 :take the hit right so so so so you can


0:46:11
Speaker 1 :

0:46:12
Speaker 0 :

0:46:13
Speaker 1 :draw all the graphs you want that show


0:46:16
Speaker 0 :that you know if we leap from here
 you know you know the you know on our present trajectory we're doing this andthere's a cliff


0:46:22
Speaker 1 :

0:46:24
Speaker 0 :if we um force ourselves into it into a
 transition and we proactively do that

0:46:29
Speaker 1 :

0:46:30
Speaker 0 :we can be on the next wave
 but there will be a period when we're in

0:46:36
Speaker 1 :a trough


0:46:40
Speaker 0 :and pretty much always there ends up
 being a trough as you leave the chasm

0:46:45
Speaker 1 :

0:46:47
Speaker 0 :but the way that public companies work


0:46:50
Speaker 1 :on this planet they're reporting


0:46:55
Speaker 0 :every quarter and the one thing that a
 ceo

0:46:59
Speaker 1 :must never do


0:47:01
Speaker 0 :is take a big hit take a big hit
 you know over some some quarter and and

0:47:07
Speaker 1 :many of these transitions


0:47:09
Speaker 0 :involve a big hit for a
 a period of time you know one two three

0:47:16
Speaker 1 :quarters
 and so you get

0:47:19
Speaker 0 :some companies and you know like


0:47:23
Speaker 1 :

0:47:24
Speaker 0 :tesla and amazon are are really good
 examples

0:47:29
Speaker 1 :of companies that take huge hits


0:47:32
Speaker 0 :but they have the luxury of being able
 to ignore the stock market for a little

0:47:36
Speaker 1 :while


0:47:39
Speaker 0 :and that's not so true today
 really but you know in the early days of

0:47:46
Speaker 1 :of both of those companies um


0:47:48
Speaker 0 :you know like like like like like they
 they both did this thing of

0:47:52
Speaker 1 :you know i don't care about the


0:47:55
Speaker 0 :quarterly reports
 i care about how many how many happy

0:48:00
Speaker 1 :customers we have
 yeah right and having as many happy

0:48:03
Speaker 0 :customers as possible can


0:48:06
Speaker 1 :often be um


0:48:09
Speaker 0 :an enemy of the bottom line yeah so how


0:48:10
Speaker 1 :do they make that work i mean
 amazon operated in the negative for a long time it's like investing into thefuture


0:48:18
Speaker 0 :right but you know you know so
 amazon and google and tesla and facebook a lot of those had

0:48:24
Speaker 1 :what it what amounted to patient money


0:48:30
Speaker 0 :um often because the there's there's
 like a charismatic central figure who has a really large

0:48:39
Speaker 1 :block of stock


0:48:40
Speaker 0 :and they can just make it so


0:48:43
Speaker 1 :so what uh on that topic just maybe it's
 a little small tangent but uh you've gotten the chance to work withsome pretty big leaders
 what are your thoughts about on tesla side elon muskleadership on the amazon side jeff bezos
 all of these folks with large amounts of stock and visionin their company i mean they're founders
 yeah either the complete founders are like early onfolks
 and uh they're they amazon have taken leave a lot of leaps uh andyou know uh that probably at the time
 people would criticize as like what is this bookstore thing

0:49:25
Speaker 0 :why yeah and and


0:49:29
Speaker 1 :you know bezos had a vision and


0:49:32
Speaker 0 :he had the ability to just follow it


0:49:34
Speaker 1 :

0:49:36
Speaker 0 :lots of people have visions and you know
 the average vision is completely idiotic and you crash and burn

0:49:42
Speaker 1 :

0:49:43
Speaker 0 :um you know the the silicon valley


0:49:49
Speaker 1 :um crash and burn rate is pretty high


0:49:51
Speaker 0 :um and they're not they don't
 necessarily crash and burn because they were dumb ideas but

0:49:57
Speaker 1 :you know often it's it's just timing um


0:49:58
Speaker 0 :timing and luck and you know you take
 companies like

0:50:03
Speaker 1 :like like tesla um


0:50:07
Speaker 0 :and and and and and really you know the
 the original tesla

0:50:11
Speaker 1 :

0:50:12
Speaker 0 :um you know sort of pre


0:50:14
Speaker 1 :um elon


0:50:19
Speaker 0 :was kind of doing sort of okay


0:50:23
Speaker 1 :but but but he just drove them
 and because he had a

0:50:29
Speaker 0 :

0:50:30
Speaker 1 :really strong vision you know he would


0:50:31
Speaker 0 :he would make calls


0:50:34
Speaker 1 :

0:50:34
Speaker 0 :

0:50:35
Speaker 1 :that were always you know or


0:50:37
Speaker 0 :well mostly pretty good i mean the model
 x was kind of a goofball thing to do

0:50:44
Speaker 1 :but he did it boldly anyway like there's
 so many people that just said like there's so manypeople that oppose them on
 the falcon one door like the doors yeah from the engineering perspectivethose doors are ridiculous it's like


0:50:57
Speaker 0 :yeah they're they are a complete
 travesty

0:51:00
Speaker 1 :but but they're but they're exactly the
 symbol of what great leadership is which islike you have a vision and you just go
 like

0:51:08
Speaker 0 :if you're gonna do something stupid make
 it really stupid yeah and go all in

0:51:14
Speaker 1 :yeah yeah and and


0:51:16
Speaker 0 :you know to to must credit he's a
 really sharp guy so going back in time a little bit to stevejobs
 you know steve jobs was a similar sort of character who hada strong vision and was really really


0:51:32
Speaker 1 :smart


0:51:34
Speaker 0 :and you you know and he wasn't smart
 about the technology parts of things but but sort of he he was really sharpabout


0:51:42
Speaker 1 :the the the sort of


0:51:44
Speaker 0 :human relationship between you know the
 relationship between humans and objects

0:51:51
Speaker 1 :um and but


0:51:57
Speaker 0 :

0:51:57
Speaker 1 :he was a jerk you know


0:52:00
Speaker 0 :

0:52:01
Speaker 1 :right can we just linger on that a
 little bit like people say he's a jerk um is that a feature or a bug well

0:52:07
Speaker 0 :that's that's that's the question right
 so you take people like

0:52:12
Speaker 1 :steve um who was


0:52:16
Speaker 0 :

0:52:17
Speaker 1 :really hard on people and and the


0:52:18
Speaker 0 :and so the question is was he really was
 he needlessly hard on people

0:52:26
Speaker 1 :or was he just making people
 reach to to meet his vision andyou could kind of spin it either way
 um well the results tell a story you know he's uh he through whateverjerk ways he had
 he made people often do the best work of their life

0:52:52
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah and that was absolutely true
 and you know i interviewed with him several times

0:52:58
Speaker 1 :

0:52:59
Speaker 0 :um i did you know various


0:53:04
Speaker 1 :negotiations with him and
 um

0:53:10
Speaker 0 :

0:53:11
Speaker 1 :even though kind of
 personally i liked him i could never work for himwhy do you think uh it that what
 can you put into words the kind of tension that you feel would beum destructive as opposed to
 constructive

0:53:33
Speaker 0 :oh he he he'd yell at people he'd call


0:53:37
Speaker 1 :them names
 and you don't like that no no i don't i

0:53:41
Speaker 0 :don't think you need to do that


0:53:43
Speaker 1 :yeah um and


0:53:50
Speaker 0 :you know he you know i think you know
 there's there's

0:53:56
Speaker 1 :pushing people to excel
 and then there's too far and i think he

0:54:00
Speaker 0 :was on the wrong side of the line


0:54:03
Speaker 1 :

0:54:05
Speaker 0 :and i've never worked for musk i know a
 number of people who have many of them that have said and it's you

0:54:13
Speaker 1 :know shows up in the press a lot that


0:54:15
Speaker 0 :that musk is kind of that way and


0:54:17
Speaker 1 :

0:54:18
Speaker 0 :one of the things that i sort of loathe
 about silicon valley these days

0:54:25
Speaker 1 :is that um a lot of the high-flying


0:54:27
Speaker 0 :successes are run by people who are


0:54:31
Speaker 1 :complete jerks


0:54:32
Speaker 0 :um but it seems like there's been
 become this there's come this this sort of mythologyout of steve jobs that the reason that
 he succeeded

0:54:45
Speaker 1 :was because he was super hard on people


0:54:47
Speaker 0 :

0:54:48
Speaker 1 :

0:54:50
Speaker 0 :and and and and and and and in
 a number of corners people start going oh if i want to succeedi need to be a real jerk yeah right
 and and and that for me just does not computei mean i know a lot of successful people


0:55:08
Speaker 1 :who are not jerks


0:55:10
Speaker 0 :

0:55:11
Speaker 1 :who are perfectly fine people


0:55:13
Speaker 0 :um you know they they tend to


0:55:15
Speaker 1 :

0:55:17
Speaker 0 :not be in the public eye the the


0:55:20
Speaker 1 :the the general public somehow lifts the
 jerks up into the into the hero status right well they

0:55:28
Speaker 0 :because they're they do things that get
 them in the press

0:55:32
Speaker 1 :yeah and you know the people who
 um you know don't do the kind of things that spill

0:55:42
Speaker 0 :

0:55:45
Speaker 1 :into the press
 um yeah i just uh talked to chris ladner um for the second timehe's a super nice guy just an example of
 this kind of kind individual that's in the backgroundi feel like he's behind like a million
 technologies but he also talked about the jerkiness of some of the folks yeah

0:56:06
Speaker 0 :yeah
 and the fact that being a jerk has become your required style

0:56:12
Speaker 1 :but one thing i'd maybe want to ask on
 that is and maybe to push back a little bitso there's the jerk side but there's
 also if i were to criticize what i've seen insilicon valley
 which is almost the resistance to working hardso on the jerkiness side is um
 it's it's so posted jobs and elon kind of push peopleto work really hard to do
 and there's a question whether it's possible to do that nicelybut one of the things that bothers me
 maybe i'm just rushing and just kind of you knowromanticize the whole suffering thing
 but i think working hard is essential for accomplishing anything interestinglike really hard and in the parlance of
 silicon valley it's probably too hard this idea that you should work smart nothard
 often to me it sounds like you should be lazybecause of course you want to be to work
 smart of course you want to be maximally efficient but in order todiscover the efficient path like we're
 talking about with the short programs

0:57:21
Speaker 0 :yeah well you know the the the smart
 hard thing yeah isn't an either or it's an and

0:57:30
Speaker 1 :as an and yeah right and
 um you know the the the the the people who say you should work

0:57:38
Speaker 0 :smart


0:57:41
Speaker 1 :

0:57:42
Speaker 0 :not hard they pretty much always fail


0:57:44
Speaker 1 :yeah thank you right i mean that's


0:57:46
Speaker 0 :that's that's just just a recipe for
 disaster i mean there

0:57:49
Speaker 1 :are there are counter examples


0:57:54
Speaker 0 :but they're more people who benefited
 from

0:57:56
Speaker 1 :luck and you're yeah exactly
 luck and timing like you said is often uhan essential thing but you're saying you
 know you can be you can push people to work hardand do incredible work without without


0:58:12
Speaker 0 :uh without being nasty yeah without


0:58:12
Speaker 1 :being nasty
 i think uh um google is a good example of theleadership of google
 throughout his history has been a pretty good example of uh

0:58:27
Speaker 0 :not being nasty i mean the
 the the the twins larry and sergey um are both pretty nice people sandra

0:58:37
Speaker 1 :paches
 very nice yeah yeah yeah and

0:58:42
Speaker 0 :you know it's it's a culture of people


0:58:45
Speaker 1 :who
 work really really hard let me ask a maybe a little bit of atense question uh we're talking about
 emacs it seems like you've done someincredible work so outside of java
 you've done some incredible work that didn't become as popular as it couldhave
 because of like licensing issues and open sourcinglike issues um
 uh what are your thoughts about the the the entire mess like what's about opensource now in retrospect looking back
 uh about licensing about open sourcing do you think uh open source is a goodthing
 a bad thing do you have regrets do you have wisdom that you've learnedfrom that whole experience


0:59:40
Speaker 0 :so in general i'm a big fan of of open


0:59:43
Speaker 1 :source


0:59:45
Speaker 0 :the way that it it can be used to build
 communities and promote the development of thingsand promote collaboration
 and all of that is really pretty grand

0:59:56
Speaker 1 :um when


1:00:00
Speaker 0 :open source turns into a religion that
 says all things must be open source

1:00:05
Speaker 1 :right
 um i get kind of

1:00:08
Speaker 0 :weird about that because it's it's sort
 of like saying you know some some versions of that um

1:00:15
Speaker 1 :

1:00:16
Speaker 0 :end up saying that that that all


1:00:20
Speaker 1 :

1:00:20
Speaker 0 :all software engineers must take a vow


1:00:23
Speaker 1 :of poverty


1:00:25
Speaker 0 :right right as though um


1:00:26
Speaker 1 :it's unethical to have money yeah
 to build a company to uh right

1:00:35
Speaker 0 :and you know there's a there's a there's
 a slice of me that actually kind of buysinto that right
 because you know people who make billions of dollars off of like a patent

1:00:48
Speaker 1 :

1:00:50
Speaker 0 :and the the patent came from like you


1:00:53
Speaker 1 :know literally a


1:00:55
Speaker 0 :a stroke of lightning that that
 hits you as you lie half a week in bed

1:01:01
Speaker 1 :yeah that's lucky good for you


1:01:05
Speaker 0 :the way that that sometimes sort of
 explodes into something that looks to me a lot like

1:01:12
Speaker 1 :exploitation


1:01:13
Speaker 0 :you know you see a lot of that in in in
 like the

1:01:18
Speaker 1 :the drug industry um
 you know when you know when you've got a

1:01:23
Speaker 0 :got got medications that cost


1:01:27
Speaker 1 :

1:01:29
Speaker 0 :you know cost you like a hundred dollars


1:01:30
Speaker 1 :a day
 and it's like no yeah so the the interesting thing aboutthe sort of
 open source uh what bothers me is when something is not open source and becauseof that
 it's a worse product yeah so like i mean if i look at your justimplementation of emacs
 like that could have been the dominant implementation like i use emacs that'smy main id
 i apologize to the world but i still love it uhand you know i could have been using um
 your implementation of emacs and why aren't i

1:02:14
Speaker 0 :so are you using the gnu max i guess the


1:02:16
Speaker 1 :default on linux is that new yeah


1:02:18
Speaker 0 :and and that through a strange passage
 started out as the one that i wrote

1:02:24
Speaker 1 :exactly so it's it still has uh


1:02:27
Speaker 0 :right yeah right well and and part of
 that was

1:02:31
Speaker 1 :

1:02:32
Speaker 0 :because you know in you know the last


1:02:35
Speaker 1 :couple of years of grad school


1:02:39
Speaker 0 :it it became really clear to me


1:02:41
Speaker 1 :

1:02:42
Speaker 0 :that i was either going to be mr emax
 forever

1:02:49
Speaker 1 :or i was going to graduate


1:02:51
Speaker 0 :

1:02:54
Speaker 1 :i couldn't actually do both
 was that a hard decision that's so interesting to think aboutyou as the pub like it's a different
 trajectory that could have happened yeah that's fascinating um

1:03:07
Speaker 0 :you know and maybe you know i could be
 fabulously wealthy today if i had become mr emax and emacs had mushroomed into

1:03:16
Speaker 1 :a series of text processing


1:03:17
Speaker 0 :applications and all kinds of stuff and


1:03:21
Speaker 1 :you know i would have
 you know but

1:03:26
Speaker 0 :i have a long history of financially


1:03:31
Speaker 1 :suboptimal decisions because
 i didn't want that life right and you know i went to grad school

1:03:40
Speaker 0 :

1:03:42
Speaker 1 :because i wanted to graduate
 um and you know you know being mr emax for a

1:03:54
Speaker 0 :

1:03:54
Speaker 1 :while


1:03:57
Speaker 0 :was kind of fun and then it kind of
 became

1:04:00
Speaker 1 :not fun not fun um


1:04:03
Speaker 0 :and you know when it was not fun


1:04:05
Speaker 1 :

1:04:06
Speaker 0 :

1:04:07
Speaker 1 :and i was you know


1:04:08
Speaker 0 :there was no way i could you know pay my


1:04:11
Speaker 1 :rent


1:04:17
Speaker 0 :right yeah and and i was like
 okay do i carry on as a grad student as ayou know i you know i had a research
 assistantship and i was sort of living off of thatand i was trying to do my uh you know i
 was doing all my ra where all of my r.a you know beinggrad student work
 and being mr emacs all at the same time

1:04:38
Speaker 1 :um and and i


1:04:41
Speaker 0 :

1:04:43
Speaker 1 :i decided to pick one


1:04:45
Speaker 0 :and one of the things that i did at the
 time was i went around you know all the people iknew on the


1:04:54
Speaker 1 :the arpanet who might be able to


1:04:55
Speaker 0 :to to take over looking after emacs


1:04:58
Speaker 1 :

1:05:01
Speaker 0 :and um pretty much everybody said
 i got a day job so so i actually found

1:05:06
Speaker 1 :you know two folks and a


1:05:11
Speaker 0 :couple of folks in a garage in new
 jersey

1:05:14
Speaker 1 :

1:05:15
Speaker 0 :um complete with a dog


1:05:18
Speaker 1 :um who are willing to take it over


1:05:22
Speaker 0 :but they were going to have to charge


1:05:24
Speaker 1 :money um


1:05:25
Speaker 0 :but my deal with them was that they


1:05:28
Speaker 1 :would um


1:05:30
Speaker 0 :only that they would make it free for


1:05:33
Speaker 1 :universities and schools and stuff
 and they said sure and you know that upset some people so youhave some
 now i don't know the full history of this but i think it's kind of uhinteresting you have some
 tension with me mr richard stallman um over the and he kind of representsthis kind of like
 like you mentioned free software uhsort of a dogmatic focus on


1:06:06
Speaker 0 :yeah all all information must be free


1:06:09
Speaker 1 :must be free so what is there an
 interesting way to uh paint a picture of the disagreement you have with richardthrough the years


1:06:19
Speaker 0 :my my basic opposition is


1:06:22
Speaker 1 :

1:06:25
Speaker 0 :that you know when you say information


1:06:27
Speaker 1 :must be free


1:06:28
Speaker 0 :uh to a really extreme form that turns


1:06:31
Speaker 1 :into
 you know all people

1:06:36
Speaker 0 :whose job is the production


1:06:40
Speaker 1 :of


1:06:44
Speaker 0 :everything from movies to software


1:06:46
Speaker 1 :

1:06:48
Speaker 0 :um they must all take a vow of poverty


1:06:52
Speaker 1 :because information must be free


1:06:55
Speaker 0 :

1:06:57
Speaker 1 :and that doesn't work for me right


1:06:59
Speaker 0 :

1:07:01
Speaker 1 :and and i and i don't


1:07:03
Speaker 0 :i don't want to be wildly rich i am not
 wildly rich

1:07:07
Speaker 1 :um i do okay
 um

1:07:14
Speaker 0 :but i do actually you know you know i've


1:07:17
Speaker 1 :

1:07:18
Speaker 0 :you know i can feed my children yeah i


1:07:20
Speaker 1 :totally agree with you i
 it does just make me sad that sometimes the closing of the sourcefor some reason the people that
 like a bureaucracy begins to build and sometimes it doesn't it hurts theproduct oh


1:07:38
Speaker 0 :absolutely absolutely it's always sad
 and there's and there is a there is a balance in

1:07:43
Speaker 1 :there
 that's a balance um and

1:07:47
Speaker 0 :

1:07:49
Speaker 1 :you know it's it's not hard


1:07:50
Speaker 0 :hard over you know rapacious capitalism


1:07:55
Speaker 1 :

1:07:56
Speaker 0 :and and it's and it's not hard over in


1:08:00
Speaker 1 :the other direction


1:08:02
Speaker 0 :um and you know a lot of
 the the open source movement they they have been magic to find a path to

1:08:12
Speaker 1 :

1:08:13
Speaker 0 :um actually making money right so
 doing things like service and support

1:08:18
Speaker 1 :works for
 a lot of people um

1:08:24
Speaker 0 :you know and there are some some ways
 where

1:08:28
Speaker 1 :it's it's kind of um


1:08:32
Speaker 0 :some of them are are a little a little
 perverse right so

1:08:36
Speaker 1 :as you know a part of things like this


1:08:39
Speaker 0 :sarbanes-oxley act and various people's
 interpretations of all kinds of accounting principles

1:08:48
Speaker 1 :

1:08:49
Speaker 0 :um and this is kind of a worldwide thing
 but if you've got a a corporationthat is depending on some piece of
 software

1:08:57
Speaker 1 :um you know the often


1:09:00
Speaker 0 :you know various accounting and
 reporting standards say if you don't have a support contracton this thing that that your business is
 depending on

1:09:11
Speaker 1 :then that's bad


1:09:15
Speaker 0 :you know so so so you know if you've got
 a if you've got a database you need to pay for support and and so

1:09:23
Speaker 1 :but there's a difference between


1:09:27
Speaker 0 :you know the the sort of support
 contracts that you know the average open sourcedatabase


1:09:35
Speaker 1 :uh producer charges and


1:09:37
Speaker 0 :what somebody who is truly rapacious


1:09:42
Speaker 1 :like oracle charges it's a it's a it's a


1:09:46
Speaker 0 :balance
 it is it is absolutely a balance and

1:09:49
Speaker 1 :

1:09:51
Speaker 0 :you know there are there are a lot of


1:09:56
Speaker 1 :a lot of different ways to make


1:09:59
Speaker 0 :you know the math work workout


1:10:00
Speaker 1 :for everybody um
 and you know the

1:10:07
Speaker 0 :

1:10:09
Speaker 1 :the very you know


1:10:12
Speaker 0 :uh un unbalanced sort of


1:10:13
Speaker 1 :

1:10:15
Speaker 0 :you know like like the winner takes all
 thing that that happens in so much of

1:10:20
Speaker 1 :of modern commerce um


1:10:22
Speaker 0 :

1:10:24
Speaker 1 :that just doesn't work for me either
 i know you've talked about this in quite a few places but you havecreated
 one of the most popular programming languages in the worldthis is the programming language that i
 first learned about object-oriented programming withyou know i think it's a programming
 language that a lot of people use in a lot ofdifferent places and millions of devices
 today java so the absurdquestion but can you tell the origin
 story of java

1:11:03
Speaker 0 :so long time ago at sun in about 1990
 there was a

1:11:09
Speaker 1 :group of us who


1:11:11
Speaker 0 :were kind of worried that there was
 stuff going on

1:11:16
Speaker 1 :

1:11:16
Speaker 0 :in the universe of computing that the


1:11:20
Speaker 1 :computing industry was missing out on


1:11:26
Speaker 0 :and so a a few of us
 started this project at sun that really got going i mean we started talkingabout it in 1990 and it really got going


1:11:36
Speaker 1 :in 91


1:11:38
Speaker 0 :

1:11:40
Speaker 1 :and it was all about


1:11:42
Speaker 0 :you know what was happening in terms of
 you know computing hardware you know processors andnetworking and all of that that was
 outside of the computer industry and that was

1:11:56
Speaker 1 :everything from the the


1:11:58
Speaker 0 :the the sort of early glimmers of cell
 phones that were happening

1:12:02
Speaker 1 :

1:12:03
Speaker 0 :then to you know you look at elevators
 and

1:12:07
Speaker 1 :locomotives and


1:12:09
Speaker 0 :process control systems in factories and


1:12:12
Speaker 1 :

1:12:13
Speaker 0 :all kinds of audio audio


1:12:16
Speaker 1 :equipment and video equipment


1:12:20
Speaker 0 :they all had processors in them and they


1:12:23
Speaker 1 :were all doing stuff with them


1:12:24
Speaker 0 :and and it and it sort of felt like


1:12:27
Speaker 1 :

1:12:28
Speaker 0 :there was something going on there that


1:12:31
Speaker 1 :we needed to understand
 and so c c and c plus plus was in the air

1:12:38
Speaker 0 :already oh no c and c plus plus
 absolutely owned the universe at that timeeverything was written in c and z plus


1:12:45
Speaker 1 :plus so where was the hunch that there
 was a need for a revolution

1:12:48
Speaker 0 :well so the the need for a revolution
 was not about

1:12:53
Speaker 1 :the a language it was about


1:12:56
Speaker 0 :it was just as simple and vague as


1:13:00
Speaker 1 :there are things happening out there


1:13:03
Speaker 0 :and we understand them we need to
 understand them

1:13:07
Speaker 1 :

1:13:07
Speaker 0 :and and so um
 a few of us went on several um somewhat epic road trips

1:13:17
Speaker 1 :

1:13:19
Speaker 0 :um literal road trips literal road trips
 it's like get on an airplane

1:13:24
Speaker 1 :go to japan visit you know


1:13:27
Speaker 0 :toshiba and sharp and mitsubishi and
 sony and all of these folks and

1:13:33
Speaker 1 :

1:13:34
Speaker 0 :you know because we worked for sun we
 had you know folks who were willing to like give usintroductions you know we we visited you
 know

1:13:45
Speaker 1 :samsung and um


1:13:48
Speaker 0 :you know a bunch of korean companies and
 we went all over europe we went to you knowplaces like like phillips and siemens


1:13:55
Speaker 1 :and thompson
 and what did you see there

1:13:59
Speaker 0 :you know for me the one of the things
 that sort of left out was that they were doing all the usualcomputer
 computer things that people had been doing like 20 years beforethe thing that really left out to me was


1:14:14
Speaker 1 :that they were


1:14:15
Speaker 0 :sort of reinventing computer networking


1:14:17
Speaker 1 :and they were making


1:14:20
Speaker 0 :

1:14:23
Speaker 1 :all the mistakes that people in the


1:14:24
Speaker 0 :computer industry


1:14:27
Speaker 1 :had had made and since i had been doing


1:14:28
Speaker 0 :a lot of work in
 in the networking area you know you know we'd go andyou know visit you know company x they'd
 describe this networking thing that they were doingand just without any thought i could i
 could tell them like the 25 things there were going to be completedisasters with that thing that they were
 doing

1:14:50
Speaker 1 :

1:14:52
Speaker 0 :um and i don't know whether that had any
 impact on any of them but but but that particular story of you know

1:14:58
Speaker 1 :

1:15:00
Speaker 0 :sort of repeating the disasters


1:15:04
Speaker 1 :of the computer science industry um


1:15:07
Speaker 0 :was there and we and one of the things
 we thought was

1:15:10
Speaker 1 :

1:15:10
Speaker 0 :well maybe we could do something useful
 here with like

1:15:14
Speaker 1 :

1:15:14
Speaker 0 :bringing them forward somewhat but but
 also

1:15:19
Speaker 1 :at the same time we learned a bunch of


1:15:21
Speaker 0 :

1:15:23
Speaker 1 :things


1:15:24
Speaker 0 :from from these you know mostly consumer


1:15:28
Speaker 1 :electronics companies


1:15:34
Speaker 0 :and you know high on the list was


1:15:36
Speaker 1 :that they viewed their


1:15:39
Speaker 0 :like relationship with the customer as


1:15:43
Speaker 1 :sacred


1:15:45
Speaker 0 :um they they were never


1:15:47
Speaker 1 :ever willing to make


1:15:50
Speaker 0 :

1:15:51
Speaker 1 :trade-offs between
 for safety right so one of the things

1:15:56
Speaker 0 :

1:15:58
Speaker 1 :that


1:15:59
Speaker 0 :had always made me nervous in the


1:16:03
Speaker 1 :computer industry


1:16:04
Speaker 0 :

1:16:06
Speaker 1 :was that um


1:16:07
Speaker 0 :people were willing to make trade-offs
 in reliability

1:16:11
Speaker 1 :to get performance um


1:16:15
Speaker 0 :you know the the you know they want
 faster faster it breaks a little more oftenbecause it's fast you know you maybe you
 run it a little hotter than you should or like like the one that always blew mymind was the way that


1:16:28
Speaker 1 :

1:16:29
Speaker 0 :um the folks at at cray super computers
 got their division to be really fast was that they did newton-raphsonapproximations
 and so you know the bottom several bits of you know a over b we're essentially

1:16:53
Speaker 1 :random numbers


1:16:54
Speaker 0 :

1:16:55
Speaker 1 :um what could possibly go wrong what


1:16:56
Speaker 0 :could go wrong


1:16:58
Speaker 1 :right and you know


1:17:04
Speaker 0 :just figuring out how to nail the bottom
 bit um how to make sure that you knowif you put a piece of toast in a toaster
 it's not going to kill the customer

1:17:16
Speaker 1 :

1:17:18
Speaker 0 :it's not going to burst into flames and


1:17:21
Speaker 1 :burn the house down
 so those are i guess those are the the principles that were inspiringbut how did from the days of
 uh java is called oak because of a tree outside the window story thatpeople know how did it become this
 incredible like powerful language well

1:17:43
Speaker 0 :so it was a bunch of things so we you
 know after all that we started you know theway that we decided that we could
 understand things better was by building a demo building a prototype ofsomething
 okay so um kind of because it was easy and fun we decided to builda control system for some home
 electronics you know tv

1:18:09
Speaker 1 :vcr that kind of stuff and


1:18:11
Speaker 0 :as we were building it we you know we we
 sort of discovered that there were some thingsabout standard practice in c


1:18:20
Speaker 1 :programming that um
 were really getting in the way and it wasn't

1:18:28
Speaker 0 :it wasn't exactly you know because we
 were writing this all the c code and c plus plus code that

1:18:34
Speaker 1 :

1:18:35
Speaker 0 :that we couldn't write it to do the


1:18:38
Speaker 1 :right thing but that


1:18:39
Speaker 0 :um one of the things that was weird in
 the group was that we had

1:18:43
Speaker 1 :um a guy who's who's


1:18:48
Speaker 0 :who's you know his sort of top level job
 was he was a business guy you know he was sort of an mba kind ofperson you know think about business
 plans and all of that

1:18:58
Speaker 1 :and


1:19:01
Speaker 0 :you know there were a bunch of things
 that were kind of you know and we would talk about thingsthat were going wrong and
 um or things were going wrong things were going right andyou know as we thought about you know
 things like like the requirements for

1:19:18
Speaker 1 :security and safety um


1:19:20
Speaker 0 :some low-level details and see like
 naked pointers

1:19:24
Speaker 1 :yeah and you know


1:19:27
Speaker 0 :so so back in the early 90s


1:19:29
Speaker 1 :

1:19:32
Speaker 0 :um it was well understood
 that you know the number one source of like security vulnerabilities ispointers was just pointers was just bugs


1:19:44
Speaker 1 :

1:19:45
Speaker 0 :yeah right and it was like you know
 50 60 70 of all security vulnerabilities were bugs and the vastmajority of them were like


1:19:55
Speaker 1 :buffer overflows yeah so you're like


1:19:59
Speaker 0 :we have to fix this we we have to make
 sure that this

1:20:02
Speaker 1 :cannot happen and that was kind of the


1:20:04
Speaker 0 :original
 thing for me was this cannot this cannot

1:20:09
Speaker 1 :continue


1:20:12
Speaker 0 :and one of the things i find really
 entertaining this year was um

1:20:17
Speaker 1 :i forget which rag published it but


1:20:22
Speaker 0 :there was this article that came out
 that was um an examination it was sort of the result of of anexamination of all the security


1:20:33
Speaker 1 :vulnerabilities in chrome and chrome is


1:20:35
Speaker 0 :

1:20:37
Speaker 1 :like a giant piece of c-plus plus code


1:20:39
Speaker 0 :and 60 or 70 percent of all the security
 vulnerabilities were stupid pointer

1:20:44
Speaker 1 :tricks
 and i thought it's 30 years later

1:20:50
Speaker 0 :and we're still there still there and
 we're still there and you know i you know that's one ofthose you know slap your forehead and


1:21:01
Speaker 1 :

1:21:02
Speaker 0 :and and just just just want to cry would


1:21:05
Speaker 1 :you attribute
 uh or is that too much of a simplification but would you attributethe creation of java to uh
 [Laughter]

1:21:13
Speaker 0 :to see borders obvious problems well
 that i mean that was that was one of the the trigger points

1:21:19
Speaker 1 :and currency you've mentioned


1:21:22
Speaker 0 :concurrency was a big deal


1:21:25
Speaker 1 :um and you know because when you're


1:21:27
Speaker 0 :interacting with people you know the
 last thing you ever want to see is

1:21:34
Speaker 1 :is the thing like waiting and


1:21:36
Speaker 0 :you know issues about the software
 development process you know when faults happen can yourecover from them


1:21:45
Speaker 1 :

1:21:46
Speaker 0 :

1:21:47
Speaker 1 :what can you do to make it easier to


1:21:48
Speaker 0 :create and
 eliminate complex data structures what can you do to fix you know the oneof the most common
 sea problems which is storage leaks

1:22:01
Speaker 1 :

1:22:02
Speaker 0 :um and it's it's evil twin the


1:22:06
Speaker 1 :um the the freed


1:22:09
Speaker 0 :but still being used piece of
 piece of memory you know you you free something and then you keep using itoh yeah you know so so when i was
 originally thinking about that i was thinking about it in terms ofof sort of safety and security issues
 and one of the things i sort of came to believecame to understand was that it wasn't
 just about safety and security but it

1:22:34
Speaker 1 :was about


1:22:36
Speaker 0 :

1:22:38
Speaker 1 :developer velocity right so


1:22:39
Speaker 0 :and i got really religious about this
 because at that point i had spent an ungodly amount of my life

1:22:47
Speaker 1 :

1:22:49
Speaker 0 :hunting down mystery pointer bugs


1:22:53
Speaker 1 :

1:22:55
Speaker 0 :and you know like like two-thirds of my
 time as a software developer was you knowbecause the mystery pointer bugs tend to
 be

1:23:05
Speaker 1 :the hardest to find because they tend to


1:23:06
Speaker 0 :be
 very very statistical the ones that hurt you know they're you know they're like a

1:23:15
Speaker 1 :one in a million chance
 um and but nevertheless create an infiniteamount of suffering right


1:23:23
Speaker 0 :because when you're doing a billion
 operations a second yeah you know one in a million chance

1:23:30
Speaker 1 :means
 it's going to happen um

1:23:35
Speaker 0 :and and so i got really religious about
 this thing about you know making it so that if somethingfails it fails immediately and


1:23:43
Speaker 1 :visibly and


1:23:46
Speaker 0 :you know one of the the the things that
 was a a real attraction of java tolots of development shops was that you
 know we get our code

1:23:58
Speaker 1 :up and running twice as fast
 you mean like the entirety of the development process the blocking all

1:24:04
Speaker 0 :that kind of stuff yeah
 if you you know so so if you measure timefrom you know you you first


1:24:10
Speaker 1 :

1:24:12
Speaker 0 :touch fingers to keyboard until you get
 your first demo

1:24:15
Speaker 1 :out uh
 not much different but if you look from

1:24:20
Speaker 0 :fingers touching keyboard to
 solid piece of software that you could release in production

1:24:28
Speaker 1 :

1:24:30
Speaker 0 :it would be way faster and i think what


1:24:31
Speaker 1 :people don't often realize there's
 yeah there's things that really slow you down likehard to catch bugs probably is
 is the thing that really slows down that

1:24:43
Speaker 0 :is it really slows things down but
 but also there were you know one of the things that you get out of

1:24:49
Speaker 1 :

1:24:50
Speaker 0 :object-oriented programming is a strict
 methodology about you know what are the interfaces between things

1:24:55
Speaker 1 :

1:24:57
Speaker 0 :and being really clear about how parts
 relate to each other

1:25:00
Speaker 1 :

1:25:01
Speaker 0 :um and what that helps with
 is so many times what people do um is they kind of like sneak around theside
 so if you've built something and people

1:25:15
Speaker 1 :are using it


1:25:16
Speaker 0 :and then and you say and you say well
 okay you know i built this thing you use it this way and then you change

1:25:23
Speaker 1 :it


1:25:25
Speaker 0 :in such a way that that it still does
 what you said it does it just does it a little bit differentbut then you find out that somebody out
 there was sneaking around the side they sortof tunneled in a back door


1:25:39
Speaker 1 :and this person their code broke


1:25:42
Speaker 0 :and because they were sneaking through a


1:25:46
Speaker 1 :side door
 and and

1:25:49
Speaker 0 :

1:25:51
Speaker 1 :normally the attitude is


1:25:55
Speaker 0 :dummy um but a lot of times


1:25:57
Speaker 1 :um you know you can't get away you can't


1:26:03
Speaker 0 :you can't just slap their hand and tell
 them to not do that right because you know it's

1:26:08
Speaker 1 :you know somebody's


1:26:13
Speaker 0 :you know some banks you know account
 reconciliation system that that you know some developerdecided oh i'm lazy
 you know i'll just sneak through the

1:26:24
Speaker 1 :back door because the language allows it


1:26:27
Speaker 0 :i mean you can't even right mad at them
 and and so one of the things i did that thaton the one hand upset a bunch of people
 is that i made it so that you really couldn'tgo through back doors right so so the
 whole point of that

1:26:41
Speaker 1 :was to say if


1:26:43
Speaker 0 :you need you know if the interface here
 isn't right the wrong way to deal with that is is togo through a back door yeah
 the right way to deal with it is to walk up to the developer of this thing andsay


1:26:55
Speaker 1 :uh change the interface fix it yep


1:26:57
Speaker 0 :right and so it was kind of like a
 social engineering thing

1:27:01
Speaker 1 :yeah and um it's brilliant


1:27:04
Speaker 0 :and people ended up discovering that
 that

1:27:09
Speaker 1 :really made a difference um in terms


1:27:10
Speaker 0 :of you know and and and a bunch of this
 stuff you know if you're just like screwing around writing your ownlike you know class project scale stuff
 a lot of stuff doesn't isn't quite so

1:27:24
Speaker 1 :

1:27:25
Speaker 0 :so important because you know you're
 you know both sides of the interface um

1:27:30
Speaker 1 :

1:27:31
Speaker 0 :but you know when you're building you
 know sort of larger more complex pieces of softwarethat have a lot of people working on
 them and especially when they like span

1:27:42
Speaker 1 :organizations
 um you know having

1:27:46
Speaker 0 :having really clear having clarity about
 how that stuff

1:27:52
Speaker 1 :gets structured um saves your life yeah
 um and you know especially

1:27:57
Speaker 0 :you know there's so much software that
 is fundamentally untestable

1:28:01
Speaker 1 :

1:28:03
Speaker 0 :

1:28:04
Speaker 1 :you know and you know until you do the


1:28:06
Speaker 0 :real thing


1:28:07
Speaker 1 :it's better to write good code in the
 beginning as opposed to writing crappy code andthen trying to fix it and
 yeah trying to scramble and figure out and through testing figure out where thebugs are


1:28:21
Speaker 0 :yeah it's just like it's like it's like


1:28:22
Speaker 1 :

1:28:23
Speaker 0 :which shortcut caused that


1:28:26
Speaker 1 :

1:28:28
Speaker 0 :rocket to not get where it was needed to


1:28:30
Speaker 1 :go
 so i think one of the most beautiful ideasuh philosophically and technically is uh
 of a virtual machine the java virtual machinewell again apologize to romanticize
 things but uh how did the idea of the jvm come to behow to you radical of an idea it is
 because it seems to me to be just a really interesting idea in the historyof programming
 so and what is it so the java virtual machine

1:29:08
Speaker 0 :you can think of it in different ways


1:29:11
Speaker 1 :um because it was


1:29:15
Speaker 0 :carefully designed to have different


1:29:18
Speaker 1 :ways of viewing it


1:29:19
Speaker 0 :so one view of it that most people don't
 really realize is there

1:29:25
Speaker 1 :is that you can


1:29:28
Speaker 0 :view it as sort of an encoding of
 the abstract syntax tree in reverse

1:29:35
Speaker 1 :polish notation


1:29:38
Speaker 0 :i don't know if that makes any sense at
 all i could explain it and that would blow all of our timeyeah um but the other way to think of it
 um and the way that it ends up beingexplained is that
 it's it's like the the instruction set of an

1:29:56
Speaker 1 :abstract machine that's designed such


1:29:57
Speaker 0 :that you can
 translate that abstract machine to a

1:30:02
Speaker 1 :physical machine


1:30:05
Speaker 0 :and the reason that that's important
 so if you wind back to the early 90s when we were talking to all of these

1:30:13
Speaker 1 :these companies doing consumer
 electronics

1:30:18
Speaker 0 :and you talked to the purchasing people


1:30:20
Speaker 1 :

1:30:22
Speaker 0 :there were interesting conversations


1:30:25
Speaker 1 :with purchasing
 um so if you look at how you know these

1:30:28
Speaker 0 :you know these devices come together


1:30:31
Speaker 1 :

1:30:32
Speaker 0 :they're sheet metal and gears and
 circuit boards and capacitors and resistors and

1:30:38
Speaker 1 :stuff and


1:30:42
Speaker 0 :everything you buy has multiple sources
 right so you can buy a capacitor from here you can buy a capacitor fromthere
 and you've got kind of a market so you know so that theyou can actually get a decent price for


1:30:59
Speaker 1 :a capacitor
 um but

1:31:06
Speaker 0 :cpus and particularly in the early 90s


1:31:09
Speaker 1 :

1:31:13
Speaker 0 :cpus were all different and all


1:31:15
Speaker 1 :proprietary


1:31:18
Speaker 0 :so if you use the chip from intel


1:31:20
Speaker 1 :

1:31:22
Speaker 0 :you had to be an intel customer for the
 end of till the end of time because if you wrote a bunch of software

1:31:30
Speaker 1 :

1:31:31
Speaker 0 :you know when you wrote software using
 whatever technique you wanted and c was particularly badabout this because there was a lot of
 properties of the underlying machine

1:31:45
Speaker 1 :that came through so if you're stuck so
 the code you wrote you were stuck to

1:31:51
Speaker 0 :that particular machine you were stuck
 to that particular machine which meant that they couldn't decideyou know
 intel is screwing us um

1:32:02
Speaker 1 :i'll start buying chips from
 you know bob's better chips this drove the like the purchasing

1:32:09
Speaker 0 :people


1:32:13
Speaker 1 :absolutely insane


1:32:15
Speaker 0 :that that they would they were welded


1:32:19
Speaker 1 :into this decision


1:32:20
Speaker 0 :and it would have they would have to
 make this decision before the first line of software was written

1:32:25
Speaker 1 :it's funny that you're talking about the
 purchasing people so that's one perspective rightit's a you could there's a lot of other
 perspectives that all probably hated this idearight but from a technical aspect just
 like the creation of an abstraction layerthat's uh agnostic to the underlying
 machine from the perspective of the developer imean it's brilliant


1:32:49
Speaker 0 :right well and and and and


1:32:52
Speaker 1 :

1:32:52
Speaker 0 :you know you know so that's like across
 the spectrum of of providers of chips but then there's alsothe the time
 thing because um you know as you went

1:33:02
Speaker 1 :

1:33:02
Speaker 0 :from one generation to the next
 generation to the next generation they were all differentand you would often have to rewrite your
 software i mean

1:33:10
Speaker 1 :generations of uh cp of machines of
 different kinds

1:33:15
Speaker 0 :yeah so so like like like one of the
 things that sucked about a year out of my life was whensun went from the the motorola


1:33:26
Speaker 1 :68010 processor to the


1:33:27
Speaker 0 :68020 processor then they had a number
 of differences and one of them hit us really hard and iended up being


1:33:38
Speaker 1 :

1:33:40
Speaker 0 :the the point guy on the worst case of
 where the new instruction cache architecture

1:33:47
Speaker 1 :heard us
 well okay so i mean so when did this idea i mean okay so yeah you youarticulate a really clear
 fundamental problem in all of computing buthow where do you get the guts to think


1:34:03
Speaker 0 :we can actually solve this you know in
 our conversations with you know all these vendors you knowthese these problems started to


1:34:12
Speaker 1 :to show up and


1:34:17
Speaker 0 :

1:34:19
Speaker 1 :i kind of had this epiphany


1:34:21
Speaker 0 :because it reminded me of
 a summer job that i had had in grad

1:34:29
Speaker 1 :school
 so

1:34:34
Speaker 0 :back in grad school my my thesis advisor
 well i had two thesis advisors

1:34:39
Speaker 1 :

1:34:40
Speaker 0 :for bizarre reasons um one of them was a
 guy named raj reddy the other one was

1:34:46
Speaker 1 :bob sproul
 um and

1:34:52
Speaker 0 :raj i love ra i really love both of them


1:34:55
Speaker 1 :but right amazing so


1:34:59
Speaker 0 :the the department had bought


1:35:02
Speaker 1 :a bunch of like early workstations


1:35:05
Speaker 0 :from a company called three rivers


1:35:09
Speaker 1 :computer company


1:35:11
Speaker 0 :and three rivers computer company was a
 bunch of electrical engineers who wanted

1:35:16
Speaker 1 :to do as little software as possible


1:35:19
Speaker 0 :so um they knew that they'd need to have
 like compilers and os and stuff like that and they didn't want to do any ofthat
 and they wanted to do that for as close to zero money as possible

1:35:30
Speaker 1 :so um


1:35:35
Speaker 0 :what they did was they they built a
 machine whose instruction set

1:35:40
Speaker 1 :was um the


1:35:43
Speaker 0 :was literally the byte code for ucsd
 pascal

1:35:47
Speaker 1 :the p code


1:35:53
Speaker 0 :and so we had a bunch of software


1:35:54
Speaker 1 :

1:35:57
Speaker 0 :that was that was written for this


1:35:59
Speaker 1 :machine


1:36:03
Speaker 0 :and for various reasons you know the
 company wasn't doing terrifically well we had all the software on thesemachines and we wanted it to run on
 other machines

1:36:13
Speaker 1 :principally the backs and
 um

1:36:19
Speaker 0 :and so raj asked me if i could come up


1:36:23
Speaker 1 :with a way


1:36:25
Speaker 0 :to port all of this software and
 translate from the from from from the the the the perkmachines


1:36:33
Speaker 1 :to vax's and


1:36:35
Speaker 0 :

1:36:36
Speaker 1 :and i think he you know what he had in


1:36:39
Speaker 0 :mind was something
 that would translate from like pascal

1:36:43
Speaker 1 :to c or pascal to


1:36:48
Speaker 0 :actually at those times pretty much it
 was you could translate to c or c and if you didn't like translatingto c you could
 translate to c um there was you know it's you know it'slike the the henry ford
 you know any color you wanted just as long as it's black

1:37:07
Speaker 1 :um and and i went
 that's really hard um

1:37:16
Speaker 0 :and and i and i noticed that you know
 and i was like

1:37:20
Speaker 1 :looking at stuff and i went oh i bet i


1:37:23
Speaker 0 :could rewrite
 the p code into vax assembly code

1:37:27
Speaker 1 :and and then i started to realize that


1:37:32
Speaker 0 :you know there were some properties of p
 code that made that really easy some properties that made it really hardso i ended up writing this thing that
 translated

1:37:43
Speaker 1 :

1:37:44
Speaker 0 :from from p code on the three
 rivers perks into assembly code on the

1:37:52
Speaker 1 :backs


1:37:54
Speaker 0 :and i actually got higher quality


1:37:57
Speaker 1 :code than the c compiler


1:38:00
Speaker 0 :and so so everything just went got
 really fast it was really easy it was likewow i thought that was a sleazy hack


1:38:08
Speaker 1 :because i was lazy and in actual fact it


1:38:10
Speaker 0 :worked really well


1:38:13
Speaker 1 :

1:38:14
Speaker 0 :and and i and i tried to convince people
 that that was maybe a good thesis topic

1:38:19
Speaker 1 :

1:38:21
Speaker 0 :yeah um and nobody was
 it was you know it was like nah really

1:38:26
Speaker 1 :that's
 i mean yeah it's really it's kind of a brilliant idearight maybe you didn't have the
 you weren't able to articulate the big picture of it

1:38:37
Speaker 0 :yeah and and i think you know that was a


1:38:40
Speaker 1 :

1:38:41
Speaker 0 :um a key part but so then you know
 clock comes forward a few years and it's

1:38:47
Speaker 1 :like


1:38:48
Speaker 0 :we've got to be able to you know that
 you know the you know if they want to be able to switchfrom you know this weird microprocessor
 to that weird and totally differentmicroprocessor how do you do that


1:39:00
Speaker 1 :and i kind of went oh


1:39:04
Speaker 0 :maybe by doing something kind of in the


1:39:07
Speaker 1 :space of


1:39:09
Speaker 0 :you know pascal p code you know i could
 do like multiple translators and i spentsome time thinking about that and
 thinking about you know what worked and what didn't work when idid the the the p code to vax translator


1:39:24
Speaker 1 :and um i talked to some of the folks who


1:39:27
Speaker 0 :were involved in small talk because


1:39:32
Speaker 1 :small talk also did about code
 and and and then i kind of went

1:39:39
Speaker 0 :yeah let's that i want to do that yeah
 because that act you know and and it had the the otheradvantage that
 you could either interpret it or compile

1:39:47
Speaker 1 :it
 and um interpreters are usually

1:39:52
Speaker 0 :easier to do but not as fast


1:39:57
Speaker 1 :as a compiler so i figured


1:40:01
Speaker 0 :good i can be lazy again um
 you know you know sometimes i think that most of my good ideas areum driven by laziness and often i find
 that people some of the people's stupidest ideas are because they'reinsufficiently lazy


1:40:18
Speaker 1 :

1:40:20
Speaker 0 :yeah they just want to build something
 really complicated it's like it doesn't need to be that complicatedyeah and so and so that's how that came


1:40:30
Speaker 1 :out


1:40:32
Speaker 0 :and um you know but that also
 turned into kind of a you know almost a religious position on my part which waswhich got me in in several other fights
 so like like one of the things that was

1:40:47
Speaker 1 :a real


1:40:48
Speaker 0 :difference was the way that arithmetic


1:40:51
Speaker 1 :worked
 um you know once upon a time there were you know it

1:40:57
Speaker 0 :wasn't always just two's complement
 arithmetic there were some machines that had one'scomplement arithmetic which was like
 almost anything built by cdc um

1:41:07
Speaker 1 :

1:41:08
Speaker 0 :and occasionally there were machines
 that were decimal arithmetic

1:41:11
Speaker 1 :

1:41:12
Speaker 0 :and and i was like this is crazy


1:41:15
Speaker 1 :you know pretty much two's complement


1:41:18
Speaker 0 :integer arithmetic has one


1:41:21
Speaker 1 :so just let's just do that


1:41:25
Speaker 0 :just to do that one of the other places
 where there was a lot of variability was

1:41:32
Speaker 1 :in the way that floating point behaved


1:41:36
Speaker 0 :and that was causing people throughout
 the

1:41:41
Speaker 1 :software industry much pain because you


1:41:42
Speaker 0 :couldn't
 do a numerical computing library that wouldwork on cdc and then have it work on an
 ibm machine and

1:41:52
Speaker 1 :work on it on a deck machine um


1:41:55
Speaker 0 :and as a as a part of that whole
 struggle there had been this this big body of work onon floating point standards
 and this thing emerged that came to be called ieee 754which is the floating point standard
 that pretty much has take

1:42:17
Speaker 1 :taken over the entire universe um


1:42:20
Speaker 0 :and and at the time i was doing java it
 had pretty much completed taking over the universethere were still a few pockets of
 holdouts but i was like you know it's important to be

1:42:33
Speaker 1 :able to say what two plus two means


1:42:37
Speaker 0 :um yeah and and so i went


1:42:38
Speaker 1 :that um and


1:42:42
Speaker 0 :one of the ways that i got into fights


1:42:46
Speaker 1 :with people was that


1:42:48
Speaker 0 :there were a few machines that did not
 implement

1:42:52
Speaker 1 :ieee 754 correctly
 well of course that's that's all short-term kind of fightsi think in the in the long term i think
 this vision is

1:43:02
Speaker 0 :won out yeah and and i think it's you
 know and it worked out over time i mean thethe biggest fights were with intel


1:43:09
Speaker 1 :

1:43:10
Speaker 0 :because they had done some strange
 things with rounding they'd done some strange things withtheir transcendental functions
 which might turned into a mushroom cloud ofyou know weirdness and the name in the


1:43:25
Speaker 1 :name of optimization
 but from the perspective of the developerthat's not that's not good well their


1:43:32
Speaker 0 :issues with transcendental functions
 were just stupid

1:43:36
Speaker 1 :okay so that that's that's not even a
 trade-off that's just absolutely

1:43:39
Speaker 0 :yeah they were they were doing range
 reduction in of first sign and cosine using a slightly wrong value for pi i

1:43:48
Speaker 1 :got it
 go ahead ten minutes so in the interest of timetwo questions so one about android and
 one about life uh so one i mean we could talk formany more hours i hope uh eventually we
 might talk again but i gotta ask you about android andthe use
 of java there because it's one of the many places where javajust has a huge impact on this world
 just on your opinion is there things that make you happyuh about the way andro uh java is used
 in the android world and are there things thatyou wish were different i i don't know


1:44:29
Speaker 0 :how to do a short answer to that
 um but i have to do a short answer to that soyou know i'm happy that they did it um


1:44:37
Speaker 1 :

1:44:38
Speaker 0 :java had been running on cell phones at
 that time for quite a few years and it worked really really well

1:44:43
Speaker 1 :

1:44:45
Speaker 0 :um there were things about how they did


1:44:48
Speaker 1 :it
 and and in particular um

1:44:54
Speaker 0 :

1:44:55
Speaker 1 :various ways that they kind of


1:44:58
Speaker 0 :you know violated all kinds of contracts
 the guy who who led it andy rubinhe crossed a lot of lines there's some
 lines crossed yeah lines were crossed that have sinceyou know
 mushroomed into giant court cases

1:45:13
Speaker 1 :um and you know they didn't need to do


1:45:17
Speaker 0 :that
 and in fact it would have been so much cheaper for them to not cross lines

1:45:25
Speaker 1 :i mean i suppose they didn't anticipate
 the the success uh of this whole endeavor umor do you think at that time it was
 already clear that this is uh it's gonna blow up

1:45:38
Speaker 0 :i guess i i i i sort of came to believe
 that it didn't matter what

1:45:43
Speaker 1 :andy did it was going to blow up


1:45:48
Speaker 0 :okay he's he's he you know i kind of
 started to think of him as as as like a

1:45:56
Speaker 1 :manufacturer of bombs
 yeah uh some of the best things in this world come about through a little bit ofuh


1:46:05
Speaker 0 :uh explosive well and some of the worst


1:46:06
Speaker 1 :and some of the worst
 beautifully put but is there um and and like you said i meandoes that make you proud that the java
 is in yeah is in millions i mean it could bebillions of devices


1:46:21
Speaker 0 :and yeah well i mean it was in in
 billions of phones before android came

1:46:26
Speaker 1 :along
 um and

1:46:29
Speaker 0 :you know i'm i'm just as proud as you
 know of the way that like the the smart card standards adopted

1:46:38
Speaker 1 :java


1:46:39
Speaker 0 :and they did it they you know everybody
 involved in that did a really good job and that's you know billions and

1:46:45
Speaker 1 :billions


1:46:49
Speaker 0 :um that's crazy the sim cards
 you know the sim cards in your pocket yeah i mean it'soutside of that world for a decade so i
 don't know how that has it has evolved but

1:47:00
Speaker 1 :um you know it's just been crazy
 so on that topic let me ask uh again there's a million technical thingsuh
 we could talk about but let me ask the absurd the old uhphilosophical question about life
 what do you hope when you look back at your lifeand the people talk about you right
 about you 500 years from now uh what do you hopeyour legacy is
 people not being afraid to take a leap of faith

1:47:39
Speaker 0 :um i mean i you know i've got this
 this kind of weird history of doing

1:47:45
Speaker 1 :weird stuff and
 um it worked out pretty damn it worked

1:47:49
Speaker 0 :out
 right and i think some of the weirder

1:47:53
Speaker 1 :stuff that i've done
 um has been the coolest and some of it

1:47:56
Speaker 0 :some of it crashed and burned and


1:48:00
Speaker 1 :um yeah you know i think well over half


1:48:03
Speaker 0 :of the stuff that i've done has crashed
 and burned

1:48:07
Speaker 1 :

1:48:08
Speaker 0 :um which has occasionally been really
 annoying

1:48:11
Speaker 1 :

1:48:13
Speaker 0 :but still you kept doing it but yeah


1:48:14
Speaker 1 :

1:48:15
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah and you know they're you know
 you even when things crash and burn you

1:48:20
Speaker 1 :you at least learn something from it by
 way of advice you know people developers engineersscientists are just people who are young
 uh to look up to you what advice would you give themhow to uh how to approach their life
 don't be afraid of risk it's okay to do

1:48:40
Speaker 0 :stupid things once


1:48:42
Speaker 1 :[Laughter]


1:48:46
Speaker 0 :maybe even a couple times you know you
 you know you get you get a pass on the the first time ortwo that you do something stupid
 you know the third or fourth time yeah not so much

1:48:56
Speaker 1 :um


1:48:59
Speaker 0 :

1:49:00
Speaker 1 :but also you know
 i don't know why but really early on

1:49:07
Speaker 0 :i started to think about um


1:49:09
Speaker 1 :

1:49:10
Speaker 0 :ethical choices in my life


1:49:13
Speaker 1 :

1:49:13
Speaker 0 :and because i a big science fiction fan


1:49:17
Speaker 1 :

1:49:20
Speaker 0 :um i i i got to thinking about
 like just about every technical decision i makein terms of how do you want you know are
 you building blade runner or star trek

1:49:32
Speaker 1 :which one's better which which future


1:49:34
Speaker 0 :

1:49:36
Speaker 1 :would you rather live in


1:49:37
Speaker 0 :you know so what's the what's the answer


1:49:39
Speaker 1 :to that well i would just


1:49:40
Speaker 0 :i would sure rather live in the universe


1:49:44
Speaker 1 :of star trek soundtrack yeah
 that opens up a whole topic about ai but that's a really interesting

1:49:50
Speaker 0 :

1:49:50
Speaker 1 :yeah yeah yeah it's a really interesting
 idea so your favorite ai system would be datauh from uh from star trek my least


1:49:58
Speaker 0 :favorite would
 easily be skynet yeah beautifully put i

1:50:01
Speaker 1 :don't think there's a better way to end
 it james i can't say enough how much of anhonor it is to meet you to talk to you
 thanks so much for wasting your time with me today not

1:50:12
Speaker 0 :
