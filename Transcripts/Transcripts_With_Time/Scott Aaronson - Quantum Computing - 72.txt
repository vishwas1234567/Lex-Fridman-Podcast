Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Scott Aaronson a professor UT Austin director of its quantum informationcenter and previously a professor at MIT
 his research interest center around the capabilities and limits of quantumcomputers and computational complexity
 theory more generally he is an excellent writer and one of my favoritecommunicators of computer science in the
 world we only had about an hour and a half for this conversation so I decidedto focus on quantum computing but I can
 see us talking again in the future on this podcast at some point aboutcomputational complexity theory and all
 the complexity classes that Scott catalogs and his amazing complexity Zoowiki as a quick aside based on questions
 and comments I've received my goal with these conversations is to try to be inthe background without ego and do three
 things one let the guest shine and try to discover together the most beautifulinsights in their work and in their mind
 to try to play devil's advocate just enough to provide a creative tension inexploring ideas to conversation and
 three to ask very basic questions about terminology about concepts about ideasmany of the topics we talk about in the
 podcast I've been studying for years as a grad student as a researcher andgenerally as a curious human who loves
 to read but frankly I see myself in these conversations as the maincharacter for one of my favorite novels

0:01:34
Speaker 1 :clearly it comes naturally but the basic
 questions don't come from my ignorance of the subject but from an instinct thatthe fundamentals are simple and if we
 linger on them from almost a naive perspective we can draw an insightfulthread from computer science to
 neuroscience to physics the philosophy and the artificial intelligencethis is the artificial intelligence

 sometimes get criticism from a listener here and there that while having aconversation with a world-class
 mathematician physicist neurobiologist aerospace engineer or the theoreticalcomputer scientists like yourself I
 waste time by asking philosophical questions about freewill consciousnessmortality love nature of truth super
 intelligence weather time travel as possible weather space-time as emergentfundamental even the crazy questions
 like whether aliens exist what their language might look like what their mathmight look like whether Malthus
 inventors discovered and of course whether we live in a simulation or notso I try with it out with it


0:05:48
Speaker 0 :

0:05:50
Speaker 1 :I try to dance back and forth from the
 deep technical to the philosophical so I've done that quite a bit so you're aworld-class computer scientist and yet
 you've written about this very point the philosophy is important for experts inany technical discipline though they
 somehow seem to avoid this so I thought it'd be really interesting to talk toyou about this point why should we
 computer scientists mathematicians physicists care about philosophy do you

0:06:20
Speaker 0 :think well I would reframe the question
 a little bit I mean philosophy almost by definition is the subject that'sconcerned with the biggest questions
 that you could possibly ask all right so you know the ones you mentioned rightare are we living in a simulation you
 know are we alone in the universe how should we even think about suchquestions you know is the future
 determined and what you know what do we even mean by being determined why are wealive at the time we are and not at some
 other time you know and and and you know when you when you sort of contemplatethe enormity of those questions I think
 you know you could ask well then why why be concerned with anything else allright why why not spend your whole life
 on those questions you know I think I think in some sense that is the theright way to phrase the question and you
 know and and and actually you know what what we learned you know I meanthroughout history but really starting
 with the Scientific Revolution we've got you know Galileo and so on isthat there is a good reason to you know
 focus on narrower questions you know more technical you know mathematical orempirical questions and that is that you
 can actually make progress on them right and you can actually often answer themand sometimes they actually tell you
 something about the philosophical questions that sort of you know may bemotivated your curiosity as a child
 right you know they don't necessarily resolve the philosophical questions butsometimes they reframe your whole
 understanding of them right and so for me philosophy is just the thing that youhave in the background from the very
 beginning that you want to you know the you know these are these are sort of thereasons why you went into intellectual
 life in the first place at least the reasons why I did right butyou know math and science are tools that
 we have for you know actually making progress and you know hopefully even youknow changing our understanding of these
 philosophical questions sometimes even more than philosophy itself does what do

0:08:26
Speaker 1 :you think computer scientists avoid
 these questions will run away from them a little bit at least in technicalscientific discourse well I'm not I'm


0:08:34
Speaker 0 :not sure if they do so more than any
 other scientists though I mean I mean I mean I mean I mean Alan Turing wasfamously you know interested and you
 know is his most famous one of his two most famous papers was in a philosophyjournal mind you know it was the one
 where he proposed the Doering test he took a Vidkun Stein's course atCambridge you know argued with him I


0:09:01
Speaker 1 :just recently learned that a little bit
 and it's actually fascinating I I was I was trying to look for resources intrying to understand where the sources
 of disagreement and debates between Wittgenstein and touring war that's aninteresting that these two minds have
 somehow met in the arc of history

0:09:19
Speaker 0 :yeah well the transcript you know of
 their the course which was in 1939 right is one of the more fascinating documentsthat I've ever read because you know a
 vit concern is trying to say well all of these these foursystems are just a complete irrelevance
 is right if a formal system is irrelevant who cares you know why doesthat matter in real life right and
 touring is saying well look you know if you use an inconsistent formal system todesign a bridge you know the bridge may
 collapse right and you know soso touring in some sense is thinking decades aheadyou know I think of where Vidkun Stein
 is the way with formal systems are actually going to be used you know incomputers right to actually do things in
 the world you know and it's interesting that touring actually dropped the coursehalfway through why because he had to go
 to Bletchley Park and you know work on something of more immediate importancethat's fascinating


0:10:19
Speaker 1 :if you take a step from philosophy to
 actual like the biggest possible step to actual engineering the actual real

0:10:25
Speaker 0 :impact yeah and I would say more
 generally right uh you know a lot of scientists are you know interested inphilosophy but they're also busy right
 and they have you know a lot on their plate and there are a lot of sort ofvery concrete questions that are already
 you know not answered but you know look like they might be answerable right andso then you could say well then why you
 know break your brain over these you know metaphysically unanswerablequestions when there were all these
 answerable ones instead so I think you know for me I I enjoy talking aboutphilosophy I even go to philosophy
 conferences sometimes such as the you know fqx I conferences I enjoyinteracting with philosophers I would
 not want to be a professional philosopher because I like being in afield where I feel like you know uh you
 know if I get too confused about the sort of eternal questions then I canactually make progress on something can


0:11:30
Speaker 1 :you maybe a link on that for just a
 little longer yeah what do you think is the difference so like the corollary ofthe criticism that I mentioned
 previously that why ask the philosophical questions of themathematician is if you want to ask for
 softball questions then invite a real philosopher on and ask thatso what's the difference between the way
 a computer scientist and mathematician Ponder's a philosophical question and aphilosopher Ponder's the falafels


0:11:56
Speaker 0 :question well I mean I mean a lot of it
 just depends on the individual all right it's hard to make generalizations aboutentire fields but you know I think I
 think if we if we if we tried to we tried to stereotype you know we wouldsay that uh you know as scientists very
 often will be less careful in their use of words you know I mean philosophersare really experts in sort of you know
 like when it when it when I talk to them and they will just pounce if you knowuse the wrong phrase for something


0:12:30
Speaker 1 :versus a very nice word you could say


0:12:34
Speaker 0 :cyclers yeah yeah where or you know they
 will they will sort of interrogate my word choices let's say to a much greaterextent than scientists would write and
 and scientists you know will often if you ask them about a philosophicalproblem like the hard problem in in of
 consciousness or free will or whatever they will try to relate it back to youknow recent research right you know
 research about about neurobiology or you know but you know the best of all wasresearch that they personally are
 involved with right right and you know and and and and you know of course theywill want to talk about that you know
 and it is what they will think of you know and then of course you could havean argument that maybe you know it's all
 interesting as it goes but maybe none of it touches the philosophical questionright but you know but maybe you know as
 a science you know at least it it as I said it does tell us concrete things andyou know even if like a deep dive into
 neurobiology will not answer the hard problem of consciousness you know maybeit can take us about as far as we can
 get toward you know expanding our minds about it you know toward thinking aboutit in a different way
 well I mean I think neurobiology can do that but you know with these profoundphilosophical questions I mean also art
 and literature do that right they're all different ways of trying to approachthese questions that you know we don't
 for which we don't even know really but an answer would look like but andyet somehow we can't help but keep


0:14:07
Speaker 1 :returning to the questions and you have
 a kind of mathematical beautiful mathematical way of discussing this withthe idea of Q Prime oh you're right they
 usually the only way to make progress on the big questions like the full of thephilosophical questions we're talking
 about now is to pick off smaller sub questionsideally sub questions you can attack
 using math empirical observation or both you define the idea of a Q Primeso given an unanswerable philosophical
 riddle q replace it with a mirror leak in quotes scientific or mathematicalquestion q prime which captures part of
 what people have wanted to know when they first asked q yes then with luckonce all q prime so you described some
 examples of such Q prime sub questions in your long essay titled whitephilosophers should care about
 computational complexity so you catalog the various Q Prime's on which you thinkof theoretical computer science has made
 progress can you mention a few favorites if any pop any pup to mind or boy yes so

0:15:12
Speaker 0 :I mean I would say some of the most
 famous examples in history of that sort of replacement well you know I mean Imean to go back to Alan Turing right
 what he did in his Computing Machinery and intelligence paper was exactly youknow he explicitly started with the
 question can machines think and then he said uh sorry I think that question istoo meaningless but here's a different
 question you know could you program a computer so that you couldn't tell thedifference between it and a human right


0:15:45
Speaker 1 :and you know yeah in the very first few
 sentences he in fact just yeah I miss

0:15:49
Speaker 0 :the Q prime precise he does precisely
 that or you know we could look at at girdle right where you know you hadthese philosophers arguing for centuries
 about the limits of mathematical reasoning right in the limits of formalsystems and you know then by the early
 20th century logicians you know starting with you know frag a rustle and then youknow most spectacularly girdle you know
 manage to reframe those questions as look wehave these formal systems they have
 these definite rules are there questions that we can phrase within the rules ofthese systems that are not provable
 within the rules of the systems and can we prove that fact right and so thatwould be another example you know III
 had this essay called the ghost in the quantum Turing machine it's you know oneof the crazier things I've written but I
 I tried to do something or you know to to advocate doing something similarthere for free will where you know
 instead of talking about is free will you know real where we get hung up onthe meaning of you know what exactly do
 we mean by freedom and can you have can you be you know or do we meancompatibilist free will libertarian free
 will what are these things mean you know I suggested just asking the question howwell in principle consistently with the
 laws of physics could a person's behavior be predictedyou know without so let's say destroying
 the person's brain you know taking it apart in the process of trying topredict them and you know and that
 actually asking that question gets you into all sorts of meaty and interestingissues you know issues of what is the
 computational substrate of the brain you know or can you understand the brain youknow just at the sort of level of the
 neurons you know it sort of the abstraction of a neural network or doyou need to go deeper to the you know
 molecular level ultimately even to the quantum level right and of course thatwould put limits on predictability if


0:17:52
Speaker 1 :you did so you need to reduce you need
 to reduce the mind to a computational device like formalize it so then you canmake predictions about what you know
 whether you could predict a B if you

0:18:03
Speaker 0 :were trying to predict a person yeah
 then presumably you would need some model of their brain all right and nowthe question becomes one of how accurate
 can such a model become can you make a model that will be accurate enough toreally seriously threaten people's sense
 of free will you know not just metaphysically but like really I'vewritten in this envelope what you were
 going to say next is you see the right

0:18:26
Speaker 1 :term here so
 it's also a level of abstraction has to be right so if your yeah if you'reaccurate at the somehow at the quantum
 level hmm that may not be convincing to us at the

0:18:42
Speaker 0 :human level well right but the question
 is what accuracy at the sort of level of the underlying mechanisms do you need inorder to predict the behavior right at
 the end of the day the test is just can you you know foresee what the person isgoing to do right I am you know and and
 and and you know and and and and in discussions of freewill you know itseems like both sides want to you know
 very quickly dismiss that question is irrelevant well to me it's totallyrelevant okay because you know if
 someone says oh well you know I will applause demon that knew the completestate of the universe you know could
 predict everything you're going to do therefore you don't have free will youknow that it doesn't trouble me that
 much because well you know I've never met such a demon hey you know uh youknow and we you know we even have some
 reasons the thing you know maybe it you know it could not exist this part of ourworld you know it was only an
 abstraction a thought experiment on the other hand if someone said well you knowI have this brain scanning machine you
 know you step into it and then you know every paper that you will ever write itwill write you know every thought that
 you will have you know even right now about the machine itself it will force ayou know a well if you can actually
 demonstrate that then I think you know that that you know that that sort ofthreatens my internal sense of having
 free will in a much more visceral way you know but now you notice that we'reasking in a much more empirical question
 we're asking is such a machine possible or isn't it I mean if it's not possiblethen what in the woes of physics or what
 about the behavior of the brain you know prevents it from existing so if you

0:20:23
Speaker 1 :could philosophize a little bit within
 this empirical question at where do you think would enter the the by whichmechanism would enter the possibility
 that we can't predict the outcome so there would be something they'll be akin

0:20:38
Speaker 0 :to a free will yeah well you could say
 the the sort of obvious possibility which was you knowkick knives by Addington and many others
 about as soon as quantum mechanics was discovered in the 1920s was that if youknow let's say a sodium ion channel you
 know in the in the in in in the brain right hey today you know it's itsbehavior is chaotic right it sort of
 it's governed by these hodja hodja ly hot skin equations in neuroscience rightwhich are differential equations that
 have a stochastic component right now where does you know and this ultimatelygoverns let's say whether a neuron will


0:21:19
Speaker 1 :fire or not that's a basic chemical
 process or electrical process by which signals are sent in the brain exactly

0:21:24
Speaker 0 :exactly and and you know and so you
 could ask well well where does the randomness in the process you know thatthat neuroscientists you're but what
 neuroscientists would would treat is randomness where does it come fromyou know ultimately it's thermal noise
 right where does thermal noise come from but ultimately you know there were somequantum mechanical events at the
 molecular level that are getting sort of chaotically amplified but you know asort of butterfly effect and so you know
 even if you knew the complete quantum state of someone's brain you know atbest you could predict the probabilities
 that they would do one thing or do another thing right I think that part isactually relatively uncontroversial
 right the the controversial question is whether any of it matters for the sortof philosophical questions that we care
 about because you could say if all it's doing is just injecting some randomnessinto an otherwise completely mechanistic
 process well then who cares right and more concretely if you could build amachine that you know could just
 calculate the even just up the probabilities of all of the possiblethings that you would do all right and
 you know um you know if all the things that said you had a 10% chance of doingyou did exactly a tenth of them you know
 and and and and and and so on that

0:22:45
Speaker 1 :somehow also takes away the feeling of


0:22:47
Speaker 0 :freedom
 exactly I mean I mean to me it seems essentially just as bad as if theMachine deterministically predicted you
 it seems you know hardly different from thatso that so then but a more a more subtle
 question is could you even learn enough about someone's brain to do that okaybecause you know another central fact
 about quantum mechanics is that making a measurement on a quantum state is aninherently destructive operation okay so
 you know if I want to measure the you know position of a particle right it waswell before I measure it it had a
 superposition over many different positions as soon as I measure Ilocalized it right so now I know the
 position but I've also fundamentally changed the state and so so you couldsay well maybe in trying to build a
 model of someone's brain that was accurate enough to actually you knowmake let's say even even well calibrated
 probabilistic predictions of their future behavior maybe you would have tomake measurements that we're just so
 accurate that you were just fundamentally alter their brain okay oror or or maybe not maybe you only you
 know you it would suffice to just make some nano robots that just measured somesort of much larger scale you know
 macroscopic behavior like you know is that you know what is this neuron doingwhat is that neuron doing maybe that
 would be enough see but now you know III but what I claim is that we're nowasking a question you know in which you
 know it is it is it is possible to envision what progress on it would look

0:24:25
Speaker 1 :like yeah but just as you said that
 question may be slightly detached from the philosophical question in the senseif consciousness somehow has a role to
 the experience of free will because ultimately what we're talking about freewill we're also talking about not just
 the predictability of our actions but somehow the experience of them

0:24:45
Speaker 0 :predictability yeah well I mean a lot of
 philosophical questions ultimately like feed back to the hard problem ofconsciousness you know and as much as
 you can try to sort of talk around it or not right and you know and then and andthere is a reason why people try to talk
 around it which is that you know Democritus talked about the hard problemof consciousness you know in 400 BC in
 terms that would be totally recognizable to ustoday right and it's really not clear if
 there's been progress since or what progress could possibly consist of is

0:25:19
Speaker 1 :there a Q prime type of sub question
 that could help us get it consciousness it's something about cars oh well I mean

0:25:25
Speaker 0 :well I mean there is the whole question
 of you know of AI right of you know can you build a human level or superhumanlevel AI and you know can it can it work
 in a completely different substrate from the brain I mean there's you know ofcourse that was Alan Turing's point and
 you know and and and even if that was done it's you know maybe people wouldstill argue about the hard problem of
 consciousness right and yet you know my claim is a little different my claim isthat in a world where you know there
 were you know human-level AI is where we had been even overtaken by such a eyesthe entire discussion of the hard
 problem of consciousness would have a different character right it would takeplace in different terms in such a world
 even if we hadn't answered the question and and my claim about free will wouldbe similar right that if there if this
 prediction machine that I was talking about could actually be builtwell now the entire discussion of the
 you know a free will is sort of transformed by that you know even if insome sense the the metaphysical question
 hasn't been answered yeah exactly

0:26:31
Speaker 1 :transforms it fundamentally because say
 that machine does tell you that it can predict perfectly and yet there is thisdeep experience of free will and then
 that changes the question completely yeah and it starts actually getting tothe question of the a the a GI the
 touring questions if the demonstration of free will the demonstration ofintelligence the demonstration of
 consciousness does that equal nauseousness intelligence and free will

0:27:02
Speaker 0 :but see elects if every time I was
 contemplating a decision you know this machine had printed out an envelope youknow where I could open it and see that
 it knew my decision I think that actually would change my subjectiveexperience of making decisions you might


0:27:18
Speaker 1 :mean doesn't knowledge change your


0:27:20
Speaker 0 :subjective experience well well you know
 I mean I mean the knowledge that this machine had prettydid everything I would do I mean it
 might drive me completely insane right but at any rate it would change myexperience to act you know to not just
 discuss such a machine as a thought experiment but to actually see it yeah Imean I mean you know you could say at
 that point you know you could say you know what why not simply call thismachine a second instantiation of me and
 be done with it right what we know what why even privilege the original me overthis perfect duplicate that that exists
 in the machine yeah or yeah there could

0:27:57
Speaker 1 :be a religious experience with a Jew
 it's kind of what God throughout the generations is supposed to that God kindof represents that perfect machine is
 able to I guess actually well I I don't even know what a work what are thereligious interpretations of freewill
 yeah does so if God knows perfectly everything in in religion in the variousreligions were does freewill fit into


0:28:26
Speaker 0 :that do you know that has been one of
 the big things that theologians have argued about for thousands of years youknow I am I am NOT a theologian maybe I
 shouldn't go there there's not a clear

0:28:36
Speaker 1 :answer in a book like I mean I mean this


0:28:38
Speaker 0 :is you know the Calvinists debated this
 the you know this has been you know I mean different religious movements havetaken different positions on that
 question but that is how they think about it you know meanwhile you know alarge part of sort of what what animates
 you know theoretical computer science you could say is you know we're askingsort of what are the ultimate limits of
 you know what you can know or you know calculate or figure out by you knowentities that you can actually build in
 the physical world right and if I were trying to explain it to a theologianmaybe I would say you know we are
 studying you know to what extent you know gods can be made manifest in thephysical world I'm not sure my
 colleagues would like that so let's talk

0:29:23
Speaker 1 :about quantum computers yeah sure sure


0:29:26
Speaker 0 :

0:29:26
Speaker 1 :as you said modern computing at least in
 the 1990s was a profound story at the intersection of computer science physicsengineering math and philosophy
 so the there's this broad and deep aspect toquantum computing that represents more
 than just the quantum computer yes but can we start at the very basics what is

0:29:46
Speaker 0 :quantum computing yeah so it's a
 proposal for a new type of computation I would say a new way to harness nature todo computation that is based on the
 principles of quantum mechanics okay now the principles of quantummechanics have been in place since 1926
 you know they haven't changed you know what's new is you know how we want touse them okay so what does quantum
 mechanics say about the world you know the the physicists I think over thegenerations you know convinced people
 that that is an unbelievably complicated question and you know just give up ontrying to understand it I can let you in
 not not being a physicist I can let you in on a secret which is that it becomesa lot simpler if you do what we do in
 quantum information theory and sort of take the physics out of it so the waythat we think about quantum mechanics is
 sort of as a generalization of the rules of probability themselves so you knowyou might say there's a you know there
 was a 30% chance that it was going to snow today or something you would neversay that there was a negative 30% chance
 right that would be nonsense much less would you say that there was a you knowan I percent chance you know square root
 of minus 1% chance now the central discovery that sort of quantum mechanicsmade is that fundamentally the world is
 described by you know these are let's say the possibilities for you know whata system could be doing are described
 using numbers called amplitudes okay which are like probabilities in someways but they are not probabilities they
 can be positive for one thing they can be positive or negative in fact they caneven be complex numbers okay and if
 you've heard of a quantum superposition this just means the sum state of affairswhere you assign an amplitude one of
 these complex numbers to every possible configuration that you could see assistthem in on measuring it so for example
 you might say that an electron has some amplitude for being here and some otheramplitude for being there right now if
 you look to see where it is you will localize it right you will sortof force the amplitudes to could be
 converted into probabilities that happens by taking their squared absolutevalue okay and then and and then you
 know you can say either the electron will be here or it will be there and youknow knowing the amplitudes you can
 predict the price the probabilities that it will that you'll see each possibleoutcome okay but while a system is
 isolated from the whole rest of the universe the rest of its environment theamplitudes can change in time by rules
 that are different from the the normal rules of probability and that are youknow alien to our everyday experience so
 any time anyone ever tells you anything about the weirdness of the quantum worldyou know or assuming that they're not
 lying to you right they are telling you you know and yet another consequence ofnature being described by these
 amplitudes so most famously what amplitudes can do is that they caninterfere with each other okay so in the
 famous double slit experiment what happens is that you shoot a particlelike an electron let's say at a screen
 with two slits in it and you find that there you know on a second screen nowthere are certain places where that
 electron will never end up you know after it passes through the first screenand yet if I close off one of the slits
 then the electron can appear in that place okay so by so by decreasing thenumber of paths that the electron could
 take to get somewhere you can increase the chance that it gets there okay nowhow is that possible
 well it's because we you know as we would say now the electron has asuperposition state okay it has some
 amplitude for reaching this point by going through the first slit it has someother amplitude for reaching it by going
 through the second slit but now if one amplitude ispositive and the other one is negative
 then note you know I have to add them all up right I have to add theamplitudes for every path that the
 electron could have taken to reach this point and those amplitudes if they'repointing in different directions they
 can cancel each other out that would mean the total amplitude is zero and thething never happens at all I closed off
 one of the possibilities then the amplitude is positive or it's negativeand now the thing can happen okay so
 that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics and now I can tell you what aquantum computer is okay a quantum
 computer is a computer that tries to exploit you know these exactly thesephenomena superposition amplitudes and
 interference in order to solve certain problems much faster than we know how tosolve them otherwise so is the basic
 building block of a quantum computer is what we call a quantum bit or a qubitthat just means a bit that has some
 amplitude for being zero and some other amplitude for being what so it's asuperposition of zero in one states
 right but now the key point is that if I've got let's say a thousand cubits therules of quantum mechanics are
 completely unequivocal that I do not just need one amp but you know I don'tjust need amplitudes for each qubit
 separately okay in general I need an amplitude for every possible setting ofall thousand of those bits okay so that
 what that means is two to the 1000 power amplitudes okay if I if I had to writethose down
 let's or let's say in the memory of a conventional computer if I had to writedown two to the 1000 complex numbers
 that would not fit within the entire observable universe okay and yet youknow quantum mechanics is unequivocal
 that if these qubits can all interact with each other and in some sense I needto to the 1000 parameters you know
 amplitudes to describe what is going on now you know now I can do you know whereall the popular articles you know about
 quantum computer and go off the rails is that they say you know they they sort ofsort of say what I just said and then
 they say oh so the way a quantum computer works is just bytrying every possible answer in parallel
 okay you know you know that that sounds too good to be true and unfortunately itkind of is too good to be true that the
 problem is I could make a superposition over every possible answer to my problemyou know even if there were two to the
 one thousand of them right I can I can easily do that the trouble is for acomputer to be useful you've got at some
 point you've got to look at it and see and see an output right and if I justmeasure a superposition over every
 possible answer then the rules of quantum mechanics tell me that all I'llsee will be a random answer you know if
 I just wanted a random answer well I could have picked one myself with a lotless trouble right so the entire trick
 with quantum computing with every algorithm for a quantum computer is thatyou try to choreograph a pattern of
 interference of amplitudes and you try to do it so that for each wrong answersome of the paths leading to that wrong
 answer have positive amplitudes and others have negative amplitudes so onthe whole they cancel each other out
 okay whereas all the paths leading to the right answer should reinforce eachother you know should have amplitudes
 pointing the same direction so the

0:37:28
Speaker 1 :design of algorithms in the space is the
 choreography of the interferences

0:37:33
Speaker 0 :precisely that's precisely what it was


0:37:36
Speaker 1 :

0:37:36
Speaker 0 :take a brief step back and write you


0:37:37
Speaker 1 :mentioned information yes so in which
 part of this beautiful picture that you've painted is information contained

0:37:46
Speaker 0 :oh well information is that the core of
 everything that we've been talking about right I mean the bit is you know thebasic unit of information since you know
 Claude Shannon's paper in 1948 you know and you know of course you know peoplehad the concept even before that you
 know he popularized the name right but I mean but a bit at zero or one that's

0:38:06
Speaker 1 :right basically that's right and what we


0:38:09
Speaker 0 :would say is that the basic unit of
 quantum information is the qubit is you know the object any object that can bemaintained tennis manipulated in a
 superposition of 0 and 1 States now you know sometimes people ask well but butbut what is a qubit physically
 and there are all these different you know proposals that are being pursued inparallel for how you implement qubits
 there is you know superconducting quantum computing that was in the newsrecently because of Google's the quantum
 supremacy experiment right where you would have some little coils where acurrent can flow through them in two
 different energy states one representing a 0 another representing the 1 and ifyou cool these coils to just slightly
 above absolute zero like a hundredth of a degree then they super conduct andthen the current can actually be in a
 superposition of the two different states so that's one kind of qubitanother kind would be you know just in
 an individual atomic nucleus it has a spin it could be spinning clockwise itcould be spinning counterclockwise or it
 could be in a superposition of the two spin States that is another qubit butshe's just like in the classical world
 right you could be a virtuoso programmer without having any idea of what atransistor is right or how the bits are
 physically represented inside the machine even that the machine useselectricity right you just care about
 the logic it's sort of the same with quantum computing right qubits could berealized by many many different quantum
 systems yet all of those systems will lead to the same logic you know thelogic of qubits and and how you know how
 you measure them how you change them over time and so you know that thesubject of you know how qubits behave
 and what you can do with qubits that is quantum information so just a linger on

0:40:09
Speaker 1 :that short so does the physical design
 implementation of a qubit mm-hmm does not does not interfere with thethat next level of abstraction that you
 can program over it so the true is the idea of it is is the a is it okay well

0:40:27
Speaker 0 :to be honest with you today they do
 interfere with each other that's because the all the quantum computers we canbuild today are very noisy right and so
 sort of the the the you know the qubits are very far from perfect and so thelower level sort of
 affect the higher levels and we sort of have to think about all of them at onceokay but eventually where we hope to get
 is to what are called error corrected quantum computers where the qubitsreally do behave like perfect abstract
 qubits for as long as we want them to and in that future you know the you knowwhich you know a future that we can
 already Street or sort of prove theorems about or think about today but in thatfuture the the logic of it really does
 become decoupled from the hardware

0:41:12
Speaker 1 :so if noise is currently like the
 biggest problem for quantum computing and then the dream is error correctingmodern computers can you just maybe
 describe what does it mean for there to be noise in the system

0:41:29
Speaker 0 :absolutely so yeah so the problem is
 even a little more specific than noise so that the fundamental problem ifyou're trying to actually build a
 quantum computer you know of any appreciable size is something calleddecoherence okay and this was recognized
 from the very beginning you know when people first started thinking about thisin the 1990s now what decoherence means
 is sort of unwanted interaction between you know your qubits you know the stateof your quantum computer and the
 external environment okay and why is that such a problem why I said talkedbefore about how you know when you
 measure a quantum system so let's say if I measure a qubit that's in asuperposition of 0 and 1 States to ask
 it you know are you zero or are you one well now I force it to make up its mindright and now probabilistically it
 chooses one or the other and now you know it's no longer a superpositionthere's no longer amplitudes there's
 just there's some probability that I get a zero and there's some that I get a oneand now the the the the the trouble is
 that it doesn't have to be me who's looking guy or in fact it doesn't haveto be any conscious entity any kind of
 interaction with the external world that leaks out the information about whetherthis qubit was a 0 or a 1 sort of that
 causes the zero Ness or the oneness of the qubit to be recordedyou know the radiation in the room in
 the molecules of the air in the wires that are connected to my device any ofthat as soon as the information leaks
 out it is as if that qubit has been measured okay it is you know the the thestate has now collapsed you know another
 way to say it is that it's become entangled with its environment okay butyou know from the perspective of someone
 who's just looking at this qubit it is as though it has lost its quantum stateand so what this means is that if I want
 to do a quantum computation I have to keep the qubits sort of fanatically wellisolated from their environment but then
 at the same time they can't be perfectly isolated because I need to tell themwhat to do I need to make them interact
 with each other for one thing and not only that but in a preciselychoreographed way okay and you know that
 is such a staggering problem right how do i isolate these qubits from the wholeuniverse but then also tell them exactly
 what to do I mean you know there were distinguished physicists and computerscientists in the 90s who said this is
 fundamentally impossible you know the laws of physics will just never let youcontrol qubits to the degree of accuracy
 that you're talking about now what changed the views of most of us was aprofound discovery in the mid to late
 90s which was called the theory of quantum error correction and quantumfault tolerance okay and the upshot of
 that theory is that if I want to build a reliable quantum computer and scale itup to you know an arbitrary number of as
 many qubits as I want you know and doing as much on them as I want I do notactually have to get the cube it's
 perfectly isolated from their environment it is enough to get themreally really really well isolated okay
 and even if every qubit is sort of leaking you know it state into theenvironment at some rate as long as that
 rate is low enough okay I can sort of encode the information that I care aboutin very clever ways across the
 collective states of multiple qubits okay in such a way that even if you knowa small percentage of my cube it's
 leaked well I'm constantly monitoring them to see if that week happened I candetect it and I can correct it I can
 recover the information I care about from the remaining qubits okay and soyou know you can build a reliable
 quantum computer even out of unreliable parts right now the the in some senseyou know that discovery is what set the
 engineering agenda for quantum computing research from the 1990s until thepresent okay the goal has been you know
 engineer qubits that are not perfectly reliable but reliable enough that youcan then use these error correcting
 codes to have them simulate qubits that are even more reliable than they areregarded the error correction becomes a
 net win rather than a net loss right and then once you reach that sort ofcrossover point then you know your
 simulated qubits could in turn simulate qubits that are even more reliable andso on until you've just you know
 effectively you have arbitrarily reliable cubans so long story short weare not at that break-even point yet
 we're a hell of a lot closer than we were when people started doing this inthe 90s like orders of magnitude closer


0:46:26
Speaker 1 :but the key ingredient there is the more
 qubits the butter because well the more

0:46:30
Speaker 0 :qubits the larger the computation you
 can do right I mean I mean a qubit Tsar what constitute the memory of yourquantum computer it also for the sorry


0:46:40
Speaker 1 :for the error correcting mechanism yes


0:46:43
Speaker 0 :so so so the way I would say it is that
 error correction imposes an overhead in the number of qubits and that it isactually one of the biggest practical
 problems with building a scalable quantum computer if you look at theerror correcting codes at least the ones
 that we know about today and you look at you know what would it take to actuallyuse a quantum computer to you know a I'm
 hack your credit card number because you know you know maybe you know the mostfamous application people talk about
 right let's say to factor huge numbers and thereby break the RSA cryptosystemwell what what that would take would be
 thousands of several thousand logical cubebut now with the known error correcting
 codes each of those logical qubits would need to be encoded itself usingthousands of physical qubits so at that
 point you're talking about millions of physical qubits and in some sense thatis the reason why quantum computers are
 not breaking cryptography already it's because of this these immense overheads

0:47:44
Speaker 1 :involved so that overhead is additive or


0:47:46
Speaker 0 :multiplicative I mean it's like you take
 the number of logical qubits that you need in your abstract quantum circuityou multiply it by a thousand or so so
 you know there's a lot of work on you know inventing better trying to inventbetter error correcting codes okay that
 is the situation right now in the meantime we are now in what physicistJohn Prescott called the noisy
 intermediate scale quantum or NIST era and this is the era you can think of itas sort of like the vacuum you know
 we're now entering the very early vacuum tube era of quantum computers thequantum computer analog of the
 transistor has not been invented yet right that would be like true errorcorrection right where you know we are
 not or or something else that would achieve thesame effect right we are not there yet
 and but but but where we are now let's say as of a few months ago you know asof Google's announcement of quantum
 supremacy you know we are now finally at the point where even with a non errorcorrected quantum computer with you know
 these noisy devices we can do something that is hard for classical computers tosimulate okay so we can eke out some
 advantage now will we in this noisy era be able to do something beyond what aclassical computer can do that is also
 useful to someone that we still don't know people are going to be racing overthe next decade to try to do that by
 people I mean Google IBM you know a bunch of startup companies or you know aplayer's apps
 yeah and in research labs and governments and yeah you just mentioned

0:49:23
Speaker 1 :a million things well backtrack for a
 sec yeah sure sure so we're in these vacuum tube days yeah

0:49:30
Speaker 0 :just entering and I'm just entering Wow


0:49:31
Speaker 1 :okay so yeah how do we escape the vacuum
 so we get to how to get to where we are nowwith the cpu is this a fundamental
 engineering challenge is there is there breakthroughs in on the physics sidethey're needed on the computer science
 side what Oh is there an is it a financialissue we're a much larger just sheer
 investment and excitement is new so you

0:50:01
Speaker 0 :know those are excellent questions oh my
 god well no no my my my guess would be all of the above yeah I mean my my guessyou know I mean I mean you know you
 could say fundamentally it is an engineering issue right the theory hasbeen in place since the 90s you know at
 least you know you know this is what you know error correction what you knowwould look like you know we we do not
 have the hardware that is at that level but at the same time you know so youcould just you know try to power through
 you know maybe even like you know if someone spent a trillion dollars on somequantum computing Manhattan Project
 right then conceivably they could just you know build a an error correctedquantum computer as it was envisioned
 back in the 90s right I think the more plausible thing to happen is that therewill be further theoretical
 breakthroughs and there will be further insights that will cut down the cost ofdoing this so let's take good briefs


0:51:00
Speaker 1 :yeah to the faux soft goal I just
 recently talked to Jim Keller who's a sort of like the famed architectand then in the microprocessor world
 okay and he's been told for decades every year that the Moore's law is goinggoing to die this year and he tried
 tries to argue that the the Moore's law is still alive and well and it'll bealive for quite a long time to come how
 long how long he's is the the main point is it still alive but he thinks there'sstill a thousand X improvement just on
 shrinking a transition as possible whatever the point is that theexponential growth you see it is
 actually a huge number of these s curves just constant breakthroughs at thephilosophical level mm-hmm why do you
 think we as a descendants of apes were able to to just keep coming up withthese new breakthroughs on the CPU side
 is this something unique to this particular endeavor or will it bepossible to replicate in the quantum
 computer space okay all right the other

0:52:11
Speaker 0 :there was a lot there too but didn't it
 to to break off something I mean I think we are in an extremely special period ofhuman history right I mean it's it is
 you could say obviously special you know in many ways right there you know youknow way more people alive than there
 than there than there have been and you know the you know the whole you knowfuture of the planet is in is in is in
 question in a way that it it hasn't been you know through for the rest of humanhistory but but you know in particular
 you know we are in the era where you know we we finally figured out how tobuild you know Universal machines it's
 that you know the things that we call computers you know machines that youprogram to simulate the behavior of
 whatever machine you want and you know and and and and and and and and and onceyou've sort of crossed this threshold of
 universality you know you've built you could say youknow touring you've instantiated touring
 machines in the physical world well then the main questions are ones of numbersthere you know ones of how many of how
 much memory can you access how fast does it run how many parallel processors youknow at least until quantum computing
 quantum computing is the one thing that changes what I just said right you knowin fear as well as well as long as it's
 classical computing then it's all questions of numbers and you know theyou could say at a theoretical have all
 the computers that we have today are the same as the ones in the 50s they're justmillions of times you know faster and
 with millions of times more memory and you know I mean I think there's been animmense economic pressure to you know
 get more and more transistors you know get them smaller and smaller get you addmore and more cores and you know and and
 and and in in in some sense like a huge fraction of sort of all of thetechnological progress that there is in
 all of civilization has gotten concentrated just more narrowly intojust those problems right and so you
 know it has been one of the biggest success stories in the history oftechnology right there's you know I mean
 it is I am as amazed by it as anyone elses right but at the same time youknow we also know that it you know and I
 I really do mean we know that it cannot continue indefinitely okay because youwill reach you know fundamental limits
 on you know how small you can possibly make a processor and you know if youwant a real proof you know that would
 justify my use of the word you know we know that you know Moore's law has toend I mean ultimately you will reach the
 limits imposed by quantum gravity you know you know if you were doing if youtried to build a computer that operated
 at 10 to the 43 Hertz so did 10 to the 43 operations per second that computerwould use so much energy that it would
 simply collapse to a black hole okay so you know that you know we you know inreality we're going to reach the limits
 long before that but you know that is a sufficient proof that there's a limityes yes but it would be interesting to


0:55:35
Speaker 1 :try to understand the mechanism the
 economic pressure these said just like the Cold War was a pressure on gettingus getting us cuz I'm both my us is both
 the Soviet Union and the United States yeah getting us the two countries to getto hurry up to get the space to the moon
 there seems to be that same kind of economic pressure that somehow created achain of engineering breakthroughs there
 resulted in the Moore's law yeah what'd be nice to replicate yeah well I mean I

0:56:07
Speaker 0 :mean some people are sort of get
 depressed about the fact that technological progress you know may seemto have slowed
 down in in many many realms outside of computing right there was this wholething of you know we wanted flying cars
 and we only got Twitter instead right and yeah go Peter - yeah yeah yeah right

0:56:26
Speaker 1 :

0:56:27
Speaker 0 :right


0:56:29
Speaker 1 :so when then jumping to another really
 interesting topic the invention so Google mmm announced with their work inthe paper in nature with quantum
 supremacy yes can you describe again back to the basic what is perhaps not sobasic what is quantum supremacy


0:56:48
Speaker 0 :absolutely so quantum supremacy is a
 term that was coined by again by John Prescott in 2012 not not everyone likesthe name you know but uh you know it's
 sort of stuck you know we don't and we sort of haven't found a betteralternative wantem computational


0:57:09
Speaker 1 :compromise dude that's right that's


0:57:11
Speaker 0 :right and but but the basic idea is
 actually one that goes all the way back to the beginnings of quantum computingwhen richard fineman and david deutsch
 people like that we're talking about it in the early 80s and-and-and and quantumsupremacy just refers to sort of the
 point in history when you can first use a quantum computer to do somewell-defined task much faster than any
 known algorithm running on any of the classical computers that are availableokay so you know notice that I did not
 say a useful task okay you know it could be something completely artificial butit's important that the task be
 well-defined so in other words you know there is it is something that has rightand wrong answers you know and that are
 knowable independently of this device right and we can then you know run thedevice see if it gets the right answer
 or not can you clarify a small point you

0:58:05
Speaker 1 :said much faster than a classical
 implementation what about sort of what about the space with where the classthere's no there's not it doesn't even
 exist a classical algorithm so so so so

0:58:18
Speaker 0 :maybe I should clarify everything that a
 quantum computer can do a classical computer can also eventually do okay andthe reason why we know that is
 that a a classical computer could always you know if it had no limits of time andmemory it could always just store the
 entire quantum state you know of your you know of the quantum store in a listof all the amplitudes you know in the
 state of the quantum computer and then just you know do some linear algebra tojust update that state right and so so
 anything that quantum computers can do can also be done by classical computersalbeit exponentially slower okay so on


0:59:01
Speaker 1 :and computers don't go into some magical
 place outside of Alan Turing's a definition of computation precisely they

0:59:06
Speaker 0 :do not solve the halting problem they
 cannot solve anything that is uncomputable in Alan Turing sense whatthey what we think they do change is
 what is efficiently computable okay and you know since the 1960s you know theword efficiently you know as well as
 been a central word in computer science but it's sort of a code word forsomething technical which is basically
 with polynomial scaling you know that as you get to larger and larger inputs youwould like an algorithm that uses an
 amount of time that scales only like the size of the input raised to some powerand not exponentially with the size of
 the input right yeah so I I do hope we

0:59:47
Speaker 1 :get to talk again because one of the
 many topics that there's probably several hours with a competentconversation on is complexity which
 probably won't even get a chance to touch today but you briefly mentioned itbut let's let's maybe try to continue so
 you said the definition of quano supremacy is basically design isachieving a place where much faster on a
 formal that quantum computer is much faster on a formal well-defined problemyes it's not that is or isn't useful


1:00:21
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah yeah right right and and I
 would say that we really want three things right we want first of all thequantum computer to be much faster just
 in the literal sense so like number of seconds you know it's a solving this youknow well-defined you know problem
 secondly we want it to be sort of a you know for a problem where we reallybelieve
 a quantum computer has better scaling behavior right so it's not just anincidental you know matter of hardware
 but it's that you know as you went to larger and larger inputs you know theclassical scaling would be exponential
 and the scaling for the quantum algorithm would only be polynomial andthen thirdly we want the first thing the
 actual observed speed-up to only be explainable in terms of the scalingbehavior right so you know I want I want
 you know a real world you know a real problem to get solved let's say by aquantum computer with 50 cubits or so
 and for no one to be able to explain that in any way other than well you knowthe to the this this computer involved a
 quantum state with 2 to the 50th power amplitudes and you have a classicalsimulation in at least any that we know
 today would require keeping track of 2 to the 50th numbers and this is thereason why it was faster so the


1:01:43
Speaker 1 :intuition is that then if you
 demonstrate on 50 cubits then once you get to 100 cubits then it'll be evenmuch more faster precisely precisely


1:01:51
Speaker 0 :yeah and and you know and and and
 quantum supremacy does not require error correction right we don't you know wedon't have you could say true
 scalability yet or true you know uh error correction yet but you could sayquantum supremacy is already enough by
 itself to refute the skeptics who said a quantum computer will never outperform aclassical computer for anything but one


1:02:16
Speaker 1 : demonstrate quantum yeah supremacy
 and two what's up with these new news articles I'm reading that Google did so

1:02:26
Speaker 0 :yeah what they actually do great great
 questions because now you get into actually you know a lot of the work thatI've you know I and my students have
 been doing for the last decade which was precisely about how do you demonstratequantum supremacy using technologies
 that you know we thought would be available in the near future and so oneof the main things that we realized
 around 2011 and this was me and my Alyx arkhipov at MIT at the time andindependently of some others including a
 Bremner joseon shepard okay and the realization that we came to was that ifyou just want to prove that a quantum
 computer is faster you know and not do something useful with it then there arehuge advantages to sort of switching
 your attention from problems like factoring numbers that have a singleright answer to what we call sampling
 problems so these are problems where the goal is just to output a sample fromsome probability distribution let's say
 over strings of 50 bits right so there are you know many many many possiblevalid outputs you know your computer
 will probably never even produce the same output twiceyou know if it's running as even you
 know assuming it's running perfectly okay but but the key is that someoutputs are supposed to be like clearer
 than other ones so sorry to clarify is

1:03:58
Speaker 1 :there a set of outputs that are valid
 and said they're not or is it more that the distribution of a particular kind ofoutput is more is the specific
 distribution yeah particular there's

1:04:15
Speaker 0 :there's there's a specific distribution
 that you're trying to hit right or you know that you're trying to sample fromnow there are a lot of questions about
 this you know how do you do that right nownow how you how you do it you know it
 turns out that with a quantum computer even with the noisy quantum computersthat we have now that we have today what
 you can do is basically just apply a randomly chosen sequence of operationsall right so we you know we in sometimes
 you know we you know that part is almost trivial right we just sort of get thequbits to interact in some random way
 although a sort of precisely specified random way so we can repeat the exactsame random sequence of interactions
 again and get another sample from that same distribution and what this does isit basically well it creates a lot of
 garbage but you know very specific garbage right so you know of all of theso if we're gonna talk about Google's
 device there were 53 qubits there okay and so there are two to the 53 powerpossible outputs now for some of those
 outputs you know there are there was a little bit more destructive interferencein their amplitude okay so their
 amplitudes were a little bit smaller and for others there was a little moreconstructive interference
 you know the amplitudes were a little bit more aligned with each other youknow that and so those those that were a
 little bit likelier okay all of the outputs are exponentially unlikely butsome are let's say two times or three
 times you know unlikely er than others okay and so so you can define you knowthe sequence of operations that gives
 rise to this probability distribution okay now the next question would be wellhow do you you know even if you're
 sampling from and how do you verify that right how do you exam how do you knowand so my students and I and also the
 people at Google we're doing the experiment came up with statisticaltests that you can apply to the outputs
 in order to try to verify you know what is you know that that at least that somehard problem is being solved the the
 test that Google ended up using was something that they called the linearcross entropy benchmark okay and it's
 basically you know so the the drawback of this test is that it requires like itrequires you to do a two to the 53 time
 calculation with your classical computer okay so it's very expensive to do thetest on a classical computer the good


1:06:50
Speaker 1 :news I think of a numbers - it's about 9


1:06:52
Speaker 0 :quadrillion ok doesn't help well well
 you know you want to be like scientific notation oh no what I mean is yeah it is

1:07:01
Speaker 1 :it is it is impossible to run on us yes


1:07:02
Speaker 0 :so we will come back to that it is just
 barely possible to run we think on the largest supercomputer that currentlyexists on earth which is called summit
 at Oak Ridge National Lab ok so I ironically for this type of experimentwe don't want a hunch
 Kubitz okay because with a hundred cubits even if it works we don't knowhow to verify the results okay so we
 want you know a number of qubits that is enough that you know click the biggestclassical computers on earth we'll have
 to sweat you know and we'll just barely you know be able to keep up with withthe quantum computer you know using much
 more time but they will still be able to do it in order that we can verify that

1:07:49
Speaker 1 :was just where the 53 comes from for the
 qubit well I mean I mean I mean I mean I

1:07:51
Speaker 0 :mean that's also that sort of you know
 the mote I mean that's that's that's sort of where they are now in terms ofscaling you know and then you know soon
 you know that point will be passed and and then when you get to larger numbersof qubits then you know these these
 types of sampling experiments will no longer be so interesting because wewon't even be able to verify the results
 and we'll have to switch to other types of computations so with it with thesampling thing you know so so the test
 that Google applied with this linear cross entropy benchmark would basicallyjust take the samples that were
 generated which are you know a very small subset of all the possible samplesthat there are but for those you
 calculate with your classical computer the probabilities that they should havebeen output and you see are those
 probabilities like larger than the mean you know so is the quantum computer biastoward outputting the strings that it's
 you know that you want it to be biased toward okay and then finally we come toa very crucial question which is
 supposing that it does that well how do we know that a classical computer couldnot have quickly done the same thing
 right how do we know that you know this couldn't have been spoofed by aclassical computer right and so well the
 first answer is we don't know for sure because you know this takes us intoquestions of complexity theory you know
 you know the I mean questions on the of the magnitude of the P versus NPquestion and think that right we you
 know we don't know how to rule out definitively that there could be fastclassical algorithms for you know even
 simulating quantum mechanics and for you know simulating experiments like thesebut we can give some evidence against
 that possibility and was sort of the you know the main thrustof a lot of the work that my colleagues
 and I did you know over the last decade which is then sort of in around 2015 orso what led to Google deciding to do
 this experiment so is the kind of

1:09:50
Speaker 1 :evidence you first of all the hard P
 equals NP problem that you mentioned and the kind of evidence the year werelooking at is that something you come to
 on a sheet of paper or is this something are these empirical experiments it's

1:10:08
Speaker 0 :it's math for the most part I mean it
 you know it's also trot you know you know we have a bunch of methods that areknown for simulating quantum circuits or
 you know quantum computations with classical computers and so we have totry them all out and make sure that you
 know they don't work you know make sure that they have exponential scaling on onyou know these problems and and not just
 theoretically but with the actual range of parameters that are actually you knowarising in Google's experiment okay so
 so there is an empirical component to it right but now on on the theoretical sideyou know what basically what we know how
 to do in theoretical computer science and computational complexity is you knowwe don't know how to prove that most of
 the problems we care about are hard but we know how to pass the blame to someoneelse yeah we know how to say well look
 you know I can't prove that this problem is hard but if it is easy then all theseother things that you know if you know
 first you you probably we're much more confident or we're hard that then thosewould be easily as well okay so so we
 can give what are called reductions this has been the basic strategy in you knowan NP completeness right in all of
 theoretical computer science and cryptography since the 1970s really andso we were able to give some reduction
 evidence for the hardness of simulating these sampling experiments thesesampling based quantum supremacy
 experiments the reduction evidence is not as satisfactory as it should be oneof the biggest open problems in this
 area is to make it better but you know we can dosomething you know certainly we can you
 say that you know if there is a fast classical algorithm to spoof theseexperiments then it has to be very very
 unlike any of the algorithms that we know which is kind of in the same kind

1:12:07
Speaker 1 :of space of reasoning that people say P
 equal not equals NP yeah it's in the

1:12:14
Speaker 0 :same spirit yeah in the same spirit okay


1:12:16
Speaker 1 :so Andrew yang a very intelligent and
 presidential candidate with a lot of interesting ideas in all kinds oftechnological fields tweeted that
 because of quantum computing no code is uncrackable is he wrong or right he was

1:12:39
Speaker 0 :premature let's say so well okay
 wrong look i you know i i'm actually i'm you know i'm a fan of andrew yang I likehis cat you know I like his ideas I like
 his candidacy I think that uh you know he you know he may be ahead of his timewith you know the universal basic income
 and you know and so forth and he may also be ahead of his time in that tweetthat you referenced so guarding
 regarding using quantum computers to break cryptography so the situation isthis okay so the famous discovery of
 Peter shor you know 26 years ago that really started quantum computing youknow as an autonomous field was that if
 you build a full scalable quantum computer then you could use it toefficiently find the prime factors of
 huge numbers and calculate discrete logarithms and solve a few otherproblems that are very very special and
 character right they're not np-complete problems we're pretty sure they're notokay but it so happens that most of the
 public key cryptography that we currently use to protect the internet isbased on the belief that these problems
 are hard okay what sure showed is that once you get scalable quantum computersthen that's no longer true okay but now
 you know uh you know before people panic there are two important points tounderstand here okay the first is that
 quantum supremacy the milestone that Google just achieved is very very farfrom the kind of scalable quantum
 computer that would be needed to actually threaten public keycryptography okay so you know we touched
 on this earlier bright but Google's device has 53 physical qubits right youthreaten cryptography you're talking you
 know with any of the known error correction method you're talkingmillions of physical qubits because


1:14:38
Speaker 1 :error correction would be required yes


1:14:42
Speaker 0 :yes yes yeah yes yeah it's a it
 certainly would right and uh you know how much you know how great will theoverhead be from the error correction
 that we don't know yet but with the known codes you're talking millions ofphysical qubits and of a much higher
 quality than any that we have now okay so you know I I don't I don't think thatthat is you know coming soon although
 people who have secrets that you know need to stay secret for 20 years youknow are already worried about this you
 know for the good reason that you know we presume that intelligence agenciesare already scooping up data you know in
 the hope that eventually they'll be able to decode it once quantum computersbecome available okay so so there is so
 so so so this brings me to the second point I wanted to make which is thatthere are other public key cryptosystems
 that are known that we don't know how to break even with quantum computers okayand there so there's a whole field
 devoted to this now which is called post quantum cryptography okay and so thereis already so so we have some good
 candidates now the best-known being what are called lattice based crypto systemsand there is already some push to try to
 migrate to these crypto systems so NIST in the u.s. is holding a competition tocreate standards for post quantum
 cryptography which will be the first step in trying to get everyweb browser and every router to upgrade
 you know and use a you know some like SSL that is would be based on on youknow what we think is quantum secure
 cryptography but you know this will this will be a long process but you know itis it is something that people are
 already starting to do and so so you know I'm sure as algorithm is was sortof a dramatic discovery you know it
 could be a big deal for whatever Intelligence Agency first gets ascalable quantum computer if no at least
 certainly if no one else knows that they have it right but eventually we thinkthat we could migrate the internet to
 the post quantum cryptography and we'd be more or less back where we startedokay so this is sort of not the
 application of quantum computing I think that's really going to change the worldin a sustainable way right the C big by
 the way the biggest practical application of quantum computing that weknow about by far I think is simply the
 simulation of quantum mechanics itself in order to you know learn aboutchemical reactions you know design maybe
 new chemical processes new materials new drugs new solar cells newsuperconductors all kinds of things like
 that what's the size of a quantum

1:17:36
Speaker 1 :computer that would be able to simulate
 the you know quantum mechanical systems themselves that would be impactful forthe real world for the kind of chemical
 reactions and that kind of work what what scalar were talking about now

1:17:52
Speaker 0 :you're asking a very very current
 question a very big question people are going to be racing over the next decadeto try to do useful quantum simulations
 even with you know 100 or 200 cubic quantum computers of the sort that weexpect to be able to build over the next
 decade ok so that might be you know the first application of quantum computingthat we're able to realize you know or
 or maybe it will prove to be too difficult and maybe even that willrequire fault tolerance or you know will
 require error correction that's an aggressive race to come off

1:18:30
Speaker 1 :with the one case study kind of like the
 computer sure the with a with the idea that would just capture the world'simagination of yeah look we can actually
 do something very yeah right but I think

1:18:42
Speaker 0 :you know within the next decade the best
 shot we have is certainly not you know Shor's algorithm to break cryptographyyou know it's just just because it
 requires you know too much in the way of error correction the best shot we haveis to do some quantum simulation that
 tells the material scientists or chemists or nuclear physicists you knowsomething that is useful to them and
 that they didn't already know you know and you might only need one or twosuccesses in order to change some you
 know billion-dollar industries right like you know the way that people makefertilizer right now is still based on
 the hopper Boetsch process from a century ago and it is some many-bodyquantum mechanics problem that no one
 really understands right if you could design a better way to make fertilizerright that's you know billions of
 dollars right there so so so those are sort of the applications that people aregoing to be aggressively racing toward
 over the next decade now I don't know if they're gonna realize it or not but youknow it is you know there's there sir
 they certainly at least have a shot so it's gonna be a very very interestingnext decade justify what's your


1:19:50
Speaker 1 :intuition is if a breakthrough like that
 comes would is it possible for that breakthrough to beyond 50 to 100 cubitsor is scale a fundamental thing like 500
 1000 of us qubits yeah so I I can tell

1:20:04
Speaker 0 :you what the current studies are saying
 you know I I think probably better to rely on that that my intuition but youknow there there was a group at
 Microsoft had a study a few years ago that said even with only about 100cubits you know you could already learn
 something new about this the chemical reaction that makes fertilizer forexample the trouble is they're talking
 about a hundred qubits and about a million layers of quantum gates okay sothere so basically they're talking about
 a hundred nearly perfect qubits so the logical qubits is you measure

1:20:44
Speaker 1 :

1:20:45
Speaker 0 :exactly a hundred logical qubits and and
 now you know the hard part for the next decade is going to be well what can wedo with a hundred to two hundred noisy
 qubits yeah yeah is that an error correction

1:20:57
Speaker 1 :breakthroughs that might come without
 and need to do thousands or millions of yeah yeah so people are gonna be pushing

1:21:05
Speaker 0 :simultaneously on a bunch of different
 directions one direction of course is just making the cube it's better rightand you know there's there there is
 tremendous progress there I mean you know the fidelity is like the the theaccuracy of the qubits isn't improved by
 several orders of magnitude you know in the you know and the last decade or twookay the second thing is designing
 better our you know let's say lower overhead error correcting codes and evenshort of doing the full recursive error
 correction you know there were these error mitigation strategies that you canuse you know that may you know allow you
 to eke out a useful speed-up in in the near term and then the third thing isjust taking the quantum algorithms for
 simulating quantum chemistry or materials and making them more efficientyou know and those algorithms are
 already dramatically more efficient than they were let's say five years ago andso when you know I quoted these
 estimates like you know circuit depth of 1 million and so you know I hope thatbecause people will care enough that
 these numbers are going to come down so

1:22:19
Speaker 1 :you're one of the the world-class
 researchers in this space there's a few groups that we mentioned Google and IBMworking at this there's there's other
 research labs but you put also you have an amazing blog you just you put a loton your put a you paid me to say it you
 put a lot a lot of effort sort of to communicating the science of this andcommunicating exposing some of the BS
 and sort of the natural just like in the AI space the natural charlatan ismthat's the word in this in quantum
 mechanics in general but quantum computers and so on can you give somenotes about people or ideas that people
 like me or listeners in general from outside the field should be cautious ofwhen they're taking in news headings
 that Google achieved quantum supremacy what should we look out for where's theCharlatans in the space where's the BS


1:23:25
Speaker 0 :yeah so a good question unfortunately
 quantum computing is a little bit like cryptocurrencyor deep learning and like there is a
 core of something that is genuinely revolutionary and exciting and becauseof that core it attracts this sort of
 vast penumbra of you know people making you know just utterly ridiculous claimsand so with with quantum computing I
 mean I would say that the main way that people go astray is by you know notfocusing on sort of the question of you
 know are you getting a speed-up over a classical computer or not right and soso you know people have like a dismissed
 quantum supremacy because it's not useful right or you know it's not itselflet's say obviously useful for anything
 okay but you know ironically these are some of the same people who will go andsay well we care about useful
 applications we care about solving traffic routing and Optima you know andand financial optimization and all these
 things and that sounds really good you know but they're you know they're theirentire spiel is sort of counting on
 nobody asking the question yes but how well could a classical computer do thesame thing yes right you know it I
 really mean the entire thing is is is you know it you know they they say wella quantum computer can do this a quantum
 computer can do that right and they just avoid the question are you getting aspeed-up over a classical computer or
 not and you know if so how you know how how do you know have you really thoughtcarefully about classical algorithms to
 do you know to solve the same problem right and a lot of the application areasthat you
 the you know companies and investors are most excited about that the popularpress is most excited about you know for
 quantum computers have been things like machine learning AI optimization okayand the problem with that is that since
 the very beginning you know even if you have a perfect you know fault tolerantyou know quantum c'mon um computer you
 know we have known of only modest speed ups that you can get for these problemsokay so so there is a famous quantum
 algorithm called Grover's algorithm okay and what it can do is it can solve manymany of the problems that arise in AI
 machine learning optimization including np-complete problems okay but it cansolve them in about the square root of
 the number of steps that a classical computer would need for the sameproblems okay now a square root speed-up
 is you know important it's impressive it is not an exponential speed-up okayso it is not the kind of game-changer
 that lets say Shor's algorithm for factoring is or for that matter thatsimulation of quantum mechanics is okay
 it is a more modest speed up let's say you know roughly you know in theory itcould roughly double the size of the
 optimization problems that you could handle right and and so what you knowbecause people found that I guess to to
 boring or you know to unimpressive you know they've gone on to to like inventall of these heuristic algorithms where
 you know because no one really understands them you can just projectyour hopes on to them right that well
 maybe it gets an exponential speed-up you can't prove that it doesn't you knowand the burden is on you to prove that
 it doesn't get a speed-up right and you know so they've done an immense amountof that kind of thing and a really
 worrying amount of the case for building a quantum computer has come to rest onthis stuff that those of us in this
 field know perfectly well is on extremely shaky foundations so the

1:27:19
Speaker 1 :fundamental question is yeah show that
 there's a speed-up yes Icicle absolutely in this space that you're referring towhich is actually interesting the area
 that a lot of people excited about is machine learningyeah so your senses do you think it will
 so I know that there's a lot of smoke currently yeah but do you think they'reactually eventually might be
 breakthroughs where you do get exponential speed ups in the machinelearning space absolutely there might be


1:27:47
Speaker 0 :I mean I think we know of modest speed
 ups that you can get for these problems I think you know whether you can getbigger speed ups is one of the the
 biggest questions for quantum computing theory you know for people like me to bethinking about now you know we had
 actually recently a really you know a super exciting candidate for anexponential quantum speed-up for a
 machine learning problem that people really care about this is basically theNetflix problem the problem of
 recommending products to users given some sparse data about their preferencesKaren etus and Prakash in 2016
 had an algorithm for sampling recommendations that was exponentiallyfaster than any known classical
 algorithm right and so I you know a lot of people were excited I was excitedabout it
 I had an eighteen-year-old undergrad by the name of Alain Tang and she was youknow she was obviously brilliant she was
 looking for a project I gave her as a project can you prove that this speed-upis real can you prove that you know any
 classical algorithm would need to access exponentially more data right and youknow this this was a case where if that
 was true this was not like a P versus NP type of question right this this mightwell have been provable but she worked
 on it for a year she couldn't do it eventually she figured out why shecouldn't do it and the reason was that
 that was false there is a classical algorithm with a similar performance tothe quantum algorithm so even succeeded
 in D quantizing that machine learning algorithm and then in the last couple ofyears building on a wins breakthrough a
 bunch of the other quantum machine learning algorithms that were proposedhave now also been D quantized yeah okay
 and so I would say again

1:29:39
Speaker 1 :backwards step yes a like a yes or a
 forward step for science but well yeah step for a machine-learning yeah thatthat precedes the big next forward step
 right right right now if it's bright now

1:29:52
Speaker 0 :some people will say well you know
 there's a silver lining in this cloud they say well look thinking aboutquantum computing has led to the
 discovery of potentially useful new classical algorithm it's true rightand so you know so you get these
 spin-off applications but if you want a quantum speed-up you really have tothink carefully about that you know e
 winds work was a perfect illustration of why right and I think that you know thethe challenge you know that you know
 that the the field is now open right find a better example find you knowwhere quantum computers are going to
 deliver big gains for machine learning you know I and I am you know not only doi ardently support you know people
 thinking about that I'm trying to think about it myself and have my students andpostdocs think about it but we should
 not pretend that those speedups are already established and and the problemcomes when so many of the companies and
 you know and and journalists in this space are pretending that like all good

1:30:55
Speaker 1 :things like life itself this
 conversation must soon come to an end let me ask the most absurdlyphilosophical last question okay what is
 the meaning of life what gives your life fulfillment purpose happiness and yeah

1:31:16
Speaker 0 :meaning I would say you know number one
 trying to discover new things about the world and and share them and you knowcommunicate and and learn what other
 people have discovered you know number two you know my friends my family mykids my students you know they're just
 the people around me number three you know trying you know when I can to youknow make the world better and
 some small ways and you know it's the pressing that I can't do more and thatyou know the world is you know in you
 know facing crises over you know the climate and over you know resurgentauthoritarianism and all these other
 things but you know trying to stand against the things that I find horriblewhen I can let me ask ya one more absurd


1:32:14
Speaker 1 :question yeah what makes you smile well


1:32:19
Speaker 0 :yeah I guess your question just did I
 don't know I thought I tried that absurd
