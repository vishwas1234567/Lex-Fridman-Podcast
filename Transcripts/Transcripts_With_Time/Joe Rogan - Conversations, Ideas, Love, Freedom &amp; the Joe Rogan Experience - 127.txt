 let's go straight to the conversation

0:01:16
Speaker 0 :with a bit of guitar first
 [Music]

0:01:53
Speaker 1 :do you ponder your mortality are you
 afraid of death

0:01:57
Speaker 0 :i i do think about it sometimes i mean
 it does pop into my head sometimes just the fact that uh i mean i'm 53so if everything goes great i have less
 than 50 years left you know if everything goes great likeno car accidents no injuries


0:02:14
Speaker 1 :but it could happen today this could be
 your last day it could be that's kind of a stoic thing to meditateon death
 there's a there's a bunch of philosophers ernest beckerand uh sheldon solomon they believe that
 death is the at the core of everything wrotethis book warm at the core
 so does that come into play in the way

0:02:36
Speaker 0 :you see the world
 i think having a sense of urgency is very beneficialand understanding that your time is
 limited can aid you greatly i think knowing that this is a temporarytime that we
 we have finite life spans i i think there's athere's great power in that because it
 it motivates you it gets you going i think being an immortal living foreverwould be one of the most depressing
 things particularly if everybody else was dying around youand i think one of the things that makes
 life so interesting and fascinating is that itdoesn't last
 you know that you you really get a brief amount of time hereand really by the time you're just
 starting to kind of figure yourself out who you are andhow not to screw things up so bad it's
 like time's up

0:03:23
Speaker 1 :the ride's over what about from your
 like from your daughter's perspective do you do you uh think about the worldwhere and now and what kind of world
 you're going to leave them

0:03:35
Speaker 0 :i do you worry about it i do yeah i do
 i do when i see these uh protests and riots and chaos and so muchso much uh anger in the world today and
 then particularly today i think because of the the pandemic and the factthat
 so many folks are out of work and through no fault of their own andcan't make ends meet and just people
 feel so helpless and angry it's uh a particularly divisive timeit's a particularly turmoil filled time
 and uh it just doesn't seem like the world of a year ago evenjust feels very chaotic and dangerous
 and this and it's a small thing like in terms ofthe like the possibilities of things
 that could happen to the world like a pandemiclike the one we've experienced it really
 just doubles the amount of deaths on a bad flu year so it relativelyspeaking
 is a small thing comparison to super volcano eruptions asteroid impacta real horrific pandemic or one that you
 know really wipes out millions and millionsof people
 it's um it's stunning how fragile civility is it's stunning how fragileour
 our society really is that something like this can come along someunprecedented thing
 unprecedented thing can come along and all of a sudden everybody's out of workfor six months
 and then everybody's at each other's throats and then politically everyone'sat each other's throats and
 and then with the advent of social media and uhthe images that you can see you know
 with the videos of police abuse and just racial tensionsare an all-time high
 to a point where like if you asked me just five or six years agolike are have racial problems in this
 country largely been alleviated i'd probably say yeah it's way better thanit's ever been before
 but now you could argue that it's not now you could argue it's no it's wayworse
 in just a small amount of time it's way worse than it's ever been duringmy lifetime you cut well while i'm aware
 of it you know obviously when i was a young boy in the 60s they were stillgoing through the civil rights movement
 but now uh it just seems very fever-pitched and i think a lot ofthat is because of the pandemic and is
 because of all the the heightened uh just tensionthe one i liken it to is
 um road rage because you know people have road ragenot just because they're in the car no
 one can get to them but also because you're at a heightened statebecause you're driving fast and you know
 you're driving fast you know you have to make split-second movements and soanybody doing something
 like what people go crazy because they're they're already at an eightbecause they're in the car and they're
 moving very quickly that's what it feels like with todaywith the pandemic feels like everybody
 is already at an eight so anything that comes along it's likelight it all on fire
 you know burn it down like that's part of what i thinkis part of the reason for a lot of the
 looting and the riots and all the chaos it's not just the people out of work butit's also that everyone feels so
 tense already and everyone feels so helpless and it's like you know doingsomething like that
 makes people uh it just it gives people a a whole newmotivation for chaos a whole new
 motivation for for doing destructive things thati've never experienced in my life


0:07:06
Speaker 1 :and your better days when you see a
 positive future what do you think is the way out of thischaos of 2020 like if you visualize at
 2025 that's a better world than today what isthat how do we get there what does that
 look like

0:07:22
Speaker 0 :it's a good question
 i do i i can honestly say i don't know and uh i wouldn't have said i don't knowa year ago
 a year ago i would have said we're going to be okay as much people hate trump theupon
 economy is doing great i think we're going to be fine that's not how i feeltoday
 today i don't think there's a a clear solution politicallybecause i think if trump wins people are
 going to be furious and i think if biden wins people are going to be furiousum and particularly like if things get
 more woke you know if people uh continue toenforce
 this uh forced compliance and make peoplebehave a certain way and act a certain
 way which seems to be a part of what this whole woke thing is thatis the most disturbing for me is that i
 see what's going on i see there's a lot oflosers that have hopped on this and
 they they shove it in people's faces and it doesn't have to make sense likethere was a black lives matter protest
 that stopped this woman at a restaurant they were surroundingher outside a restaurant they were
 forcing her to raise her fist in compliance this is a woman who'smarched for black lives multiple times
 black lives matter multiple times and the people around her doing this wereall white
 yeah it's all it's all weird my friend coach t he's a wrestling coachalso uh on a podcast my friend brian
 moses his take on it is that black and he's ablack guy he says black lives matter's a
 white cult and i'm like when you see that pictureit's hard to argue that he's got a point
 it's clearly not all about that but there's a lot of people that have jumpedon board
 that are very much like cult members because the thing about black livesmatter or any movement
 is you can't control who joins there's noentrance uh examination so you don't go
 okay how do you feel about this what's your perceptions on that likehow you like the the man who shot the
 trump supporter in portland you know that guy whomurdered the trump supporter then the
 cop shot him that guy was walking around with hishand
 on his gun looking for trump supporters just want i mean he's aknown violent guy who was walking around
 looking for trump supporters found one and shot onethat has nothing to do with black lives
 matter he's a white guy he shot another white guy it's justit's just madness you know and then that
 kind of madness is uh it's disturbing to see itramp up so quickly i mean there's been
 there's been riots in portland every night oh excuseme demonstrations
 for 101 days now 101 days in a row of them lighting things on firebreaking into federal buildings it's
 like whoever saw that coming nobody saw thatcoming so
 i don't know what the solution is and i don't know what it looks like in fiveyears so 2025 to answer your question
 like it could be anything i mean we could belooking at mad max we could be looking
 at the apocalypse we could we could also belooking at an
 invasion from another country we could be looking at a war like a real

0:10:23
Speaker 1 :hot war to put a little bit of
 responsibility on you like for me i've listened to you sincethe red band olive garden days
 that's the very beginning and uh there was something in the way you communicateabout the world maybe there was others
 but you're the one i was aware of is you're open-minded and uhlike loving towards the world especially
 as the podcast developed like you just demonstrated and lived thiskind of just
 kindness or maybe even like lack of jealousy in your own little professionof comedy
 it was clear that you didn't you didn't succumbto the weaker aspects of human nature
 and thereby inspire like people like me who i was i was naturally probablyespecially in like the 20s
 early 20s kind of jealous on the success of othersand you're really the primary person
 that taught me to um truly celebrate the success ofothers
 and so by way of question you kind of have a role in this ofmaking a better 2025 you have such a big
 megaphone is there something you think you can do on this podcastwith the words
 the way you talk the the things you discussthat could create a better 2025 i think


0:11:38
Speaker 0 :if anything
 i could help in leading by example but you know that's only going to helpthe people that are listening
 i don't know what else i can do in terms of like make the world a better placeother than
 express my hopes and wishes for that and just try to be as nice as i can topeople as often as i can
 but i also think that i've fallen into this weird category particularly withthe spotify deal
 where um you know i'm one of them now i'm not a regular person anymore now i'mlike some
 famous rich guy so you go from being a regular person to a famous rich guythat's out of touch
 you know and uh that that's a real issue whenever you're talking about theeconomy
 about just real life problems it's it's

0:12:30
Speaker 1 :interesting it kind of hurts my heart to
 hear people say about elon musk he's just a billionaire yeahit's an interesting statement but i
 think if you just continue being you and he continue being him peoplepeople i think people are just voicing
 their worry that you become some rich guy i don't

0:12:49
Speaker 0 :even know if they're doing that
 i think they're just finding the way he describes it an attack vectorright yeah and i think he's right i
 think they just uh they can dismiss you by just saying oh you're you're just athat
 you know you're a you know you're easily uh

0:13:08
Speaker 1 :definable right but there i mean there's
 truth to that you if you're not careful you can becomeout of touch
 but you that that's an interesting thing like howwhy haven't you become out of touch like
 as a human off the podcast you you don't act likeuh
 like you you talk to somebody like me you don't talk like a famous personor you you don't you don't act rich
 like you're better than others there's a certain listen i've talked to quite afew
 you have too but i've talked to especially kind of group of people thatlike nobel prize winners let's say
 they have sometimes have an error to themof arrogance yeah and you don't what's


0:13:48
Speaker 0 :that about
 well you got to know what that is right like umthat air of arrogance comes from
 drinking your own kool-aid you you startbelieving that
 somehow another just because you're getting praise from all these peoplethat you really
 are something different usually it exemplifiesthere's there's something there there's
 where there's a lack of struggle you know and i think uh struggle isprobably one of the most important
 balancing tools that a person can have and for me um i strugglementally and i struggle physically i
 struggle mentally in that i like we were talking about onthe podcast we did previously
 you and i on my podcast said i'm not a fan of my worki'm not a fan of what i do i'm my
 harshest critic so anytime anybody says something badabout me i'm like
 listen i said way worse about myself i you know i don't like anything i do i'mruthlessly introspective and i will
 continue to be that way because that's the only way you could be good as acomedian there's no other way you can't
 just think you're awesome and just go out there you have toyou have to be like picking apart
 everything you do but there's a balance to that too because you have to haveenough confidence to go out there and
 perform you can't think oh my god i suck i knowwhat i'm doing but i know what i'm doing
 because i put in all that work and one of the reasons why i put in all thatwork is i don't like
 the i don't like the end result most of the time so i need to work at it all thetime
 and then there's physical struggle which i think balances everything outwithout physical struggle i i've i
 always make the analogy that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery where ifyou
 have extra charge it's like it leaks out of the top and itbecomes unmanageable and messy and
 that's how my psyche is if i if i have too much energy if i'mnot
 if i'm not exerting myself in a violent way like an explosive way likewearing myself out
 i just don't like the way the world is i don't like the way i interface with theworld i'm too
 tense i'm i'm i'm i'm too quick to be upset about things up to but when iwork out hard
 and you know i put in a brutal training sessioneverything's fine well the first time i


0:16:07
Speaker 1 :talked to you on
 jerry uh you were doing up to um so sober october and there's somethingin your eyes
 uh like i think you've talked about that you you know you exercise the demons outessentially so you
 exercise to get whatever the parts of you that you don't like outuh there is a dark there's a darkness in
 you there like the the competitiveness and the focus ofthat person


0:16:34
Speaker 0 :that was a scary time in a lot of ways
 that sober october thing because uh my friends were all talking[ __ ] right because we're
 competing against each other and these fitness challenges andyou had uh one point poor
 like you got a certain amount of points for each minute that you went at 80percent
 of your max heart rate and one day i got 1100 pointsso i did seven hours on an elliptical
 machine watching the bathhouse scene from johnwick where he murders all those people
 i watched him probably 50 times in a row i went crazyi went crazy but i went crazy in a weird
 way where it brought me back to my um my fightingdays
 it was like the same that person came out again it's like well i didn't evenknow he was in there
 it's like they're like like like an assassin like a killer likei felt
 i felt like i felt like a

0:17:31
Speaker 1 :like a different person is it echoes of
 like what mike tyson talked about essentially like

0:17:35
Speaker 0 :the but no orgasm in their oceans
 all the crazy [ __ ] that he was is there

0:17:41
Speaker 1 :is there that
 is there a violent person in there oh

0:17:43
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah there's a lot of
 there's a lot of violence in me for sure i don't know if it's genetic or learnedor
 it's because during my formative years from the time i was15 until i was 22 all i did was fight
 that was all i did that was all i did all i did was trainand compete that's all i did that was my


0:18:02
Speaker 1 :whole life is it connected to uh
 so you uh your mom and dad broke up early on is it connected to

0:18:09
Speaker 0 :the dad at all i i'm sure it's connected
 to him also because he was violent and it mademe feel very scared to be around him
 but i also think um it's connected in who he was as a human is transferredinto my dna
 you know i think there's a certain amount of i meani mean to be prejudiced against myself i
 look like a violent person you know if i didn't know me i'm justeven the way i'm built and not even just
 the working out bar just the size of my hands andlike there's the width of my shoulders
 like there's most likely a lot of violence in myhistory in my past and my ancestry
 and i think um i think we minimized that with people like so much of yourbehavior like
 when i see my daughter i have a one daughter that's obsessivein terms of like she wants to get really
 good at things like could she and she'll practice things all day longand and it's 100 my personality
 like she's me in a female form but without the anger as much and withoutthe
 um fear like she's you know loving household and everything like that butshe has this intense obsession with
 doing things and doing things really well and getting better what's the pointwe have to tell her to stop like stop
 doing handsprings in the house stop stop come on just sit down have dinnerlike one more one more
 like she's just like she's like she's psycho yeah umand i think there's a lot of
 behavior and personality and a lot of these things are passed downthrough genetics we don't really know
 right we don't know how much of who you aregenetically is learned behavior
 you know nature and nurture we don't know if it's learned behavioror whether or not it's something that's
 intrinsically a part of you because of you know who your parents werei think there's there's certainly some
 genetic violence in me

0:20:06
Speaker 1 :there's something you channeled it yeah
 you figured out is basically your life it's a productive exploration of how to

0:20:13
Speaker 0 :channel that yes
 try how to figure out how to get get that monkey to sitdown and calm down there's another
 person in there like this is a calm rational kindfriendly person who just wants to laugh
 and have fun and then there's that dude who comes out when i did sober octoberthat guy's scary i don't like that guy
 yeah a guy just wants to get up in the morning and go you know it's likeit's um i mean when i was competing it
 was necessary but it makes me remember i didn't reallyremember what a
 what i used to be like until that it's likewhen i'm working out seven hours a day
 yeah and just so obsessed and and all i was thinkingabout was winning
 that's all i was thinking about like if they were if they were working out fivehours a day i wanted
 i wanted them to know that i was going to work out an extra three hoursand i was going to get up early and i
 was going to text them all hey [ __ ] i'm up already taking pictures sendselfies you know i was like
 you're going to die i kept telling them you're all going to die and try to keepup with me you're going to die


0:21:15
Speaker 1 :you weren't fully joking no i wasn't


0:21:16
Speaker 0 :joking at all
 that's what i was [ __ ] up about it was

0:21:19
Speaker 1 :the scary thing when i interacted with
 goggins and what i saw in you on during thattime
 is like this guy like like this is why i've been avoidingdave ganga's recently
 [Laughter] is like because he wants to meet he hasto do like talk on this podcast but he
 also wants to run an ultra marathon with me and i felt likethis is a person
 if i spend any time in this realm if i spend any time with the joe rogan ofthat
 sober october like i might have to die to get outlike there's this kind of uh yeah


0:21:52
Speaker 0 :there's a competitive aspect that's
 super unhealthy i mean you saw the video that we watchedearlier today of goggins draining his
 knee that would stop me from running everagain because i would think in my head
 okay i'm gonna ruin my cartilage i'm gonnaneed a knee replacement i would start
 thinking i would go down that line but he isperpetually
 in this push-it mindset you know what he talkcalls the dog in him you know he's got
 that dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dogyou know and that's um that's who he is
 that's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational and he's fuelfor millions and millions of people i
 mean he really is he motivates people in a way that isso powerful but it can be very
 destructive i just i know i know nowespecially after the sober october thing
 that that thing's still in me you know i didn't know because i reallyhaven't done anything physically
 competitive except one time i was supposed to fightwesley snipes it came out then too
 that came out too that got creepy too but luckily that never happenedbut that was many months of training
 like training twice a day every day kickboxing in the morningjiu jitsu at night i was just going
 going and going and going and i was just thinking just all daylong and it but it [ __ ] with all the
 other aspects of your life [ __ ] with your friendships [ __ ] withyour your [ __ ] with my comedy [ __ ] with
 everything because that mindset is not a mindset ofan
 artist it's a mindset of a conqueror the concur

0:23:20
Speaker 1 :yeah destroyer that's why it's so
 interesting to see mike tyson make the switch it's clear that likewhatever that is however that fight goes
 he made us there's a switch of a dif he steppedinto a different dimension


0:23:32
Speaker 0 :roy jones jr is coming on my podcast
 soon and uh you know roy's gonna be on uh before the fight i'mi'm so curious to see how it goes down
 but genuinely concerned because mike tyson is a heavyweight androy jones at his best was 168 pounds


0:23:50
Speaker 1 :and um i don't know if roy has that room
 in his house mental house of where mike tyson goes i

0:23:56
Speaker 0 :don't know
 i don't know if he has a rope mike doesn't have a room he's he's got anempire in there
 with the open side the door there's a whole empire in his head andhe's he's in that
 firmly you know when he got out of the weed and andstarted training again like you could
 see it in him and by the way physically in person he looks spectacular he lookslike a [ __ ] adonis
 i mean he looks ready to go yeah it's

0:24:23
Speaker 1 :crazy yeah i watch the videos of him
 what about you uh have you ever considered competing in jiu jitsu

0:24:27
Speaker 0 :no for that very reason i don't want to
 get obsessed that's my my number one concern i had toquit video games
 yeah when we were playing video games at the studio i had to quit because i wasplaying five hours a day like out of
 nowhere all of a sudden i was playing five hours a day i was coming home latefor dinner
 i was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games and playingi get obsessed with things and i have to
 recognize what that is and these competitivethings like competitive
 especially like really exciting competitive things like video gamesthey're very dangerous for me the
 ultimate competitive video game is like jiu jitsu and um if i was young i mostcertainly would have done it if i didn't
 have like a very clear career path it wassomething that i enjoyed
 my concern would be that i would become a professional jiu jitsu fighterwhen i was young and then i would not
 have the energy to do stand up and do all the other thingsthat i wound up doing as a career
 when i was um 21 i quit my job teaching i was teaching atboston university
 i was teaching taekwondo there and i i knewand i also had my own school in revere i
 knew i couldn't do it right and also be doing stand-up comedyi knew i couldn't do both of those
 things there was no way you have to be

0:25:41
Speaker 1 :cognizant of uh
 that obsessive force within you to make

0:25:45
Speaker 0 :sure uh yes i
 i have to know how to manage my mental illness right that'sthat's a very particular mental illness
 and i think that mental illness again my formative years from 15 until i wasyou know 21-ish 22 those
 those years were spent constantly obsessedwith martial arts that was my whole day
 i mean i trained almost every day the only time i would not train is if iwas either injured or
 if i was exhausted if i needed a day off but i was obsessedand so that part of my personality
 that i haven't nurtured is always going to be there under the surfaceand when you it gets reignited by
 something it's very weird it's a weird feeling and itcan get reignited with a video game
 it can get reignited with anything that that obsessivethat you know whatever it is that
 competitive demon yeah the way you talk

0:26:38
Speaker 1 :about guitar
 i know you would love fall in love with playing guitar but i think you're verywise to not touch that thing that's why


0:26:44
Speaker 0 :i want golf
 i have friends who want to golf i'm like [ __ ] with that thing

0:26:49
Speaker 1 :so a lot of people ask me about uh like
 what's uh joe rogan's jiu jitsu game like likelike
 like assuming that i i somehow spend uh hours rolling with you before and afterwe interact i mean what's a good uh you
 should at some point show a technique or something that'll be

0:27:07
Speaker 0 :fun sure i mean i've got what's your


0:27:08
Speaker 1 :game
 what's your name oh there i saw i saw you doing a ithink had an arm uh something online


0:27:15
Speaker 0 :yeah
 i did that was i [ __ ] my neck i'm doing head and arm chokes i did them somuch
 that i i you know because you use your neck so much with head and arms chokesi developed like a real kink in my neck
 and uh it turned out i had a bulging discand uh you know so you do it on that


0:27:31
Speaker 1 :just one side


0:27:32
Speaker 0 :well it was uh no i could do it on the
 left side but i definitely am better on the right sidethe right side was my best side so if


0:27:39
Speaker 1 :you were to compete let's say like
 what's your a game what would you go from standing up howwould you go to submission would you
 pull guard would you take down what how would you pass guard what's i

0:27:51
Speaker 0 :don't have good takedowns i mean i was
 not a good wrestler so i would most likely either pull guardor i would pull half guard do you have a
 good guard yes are you comfortable being

0:28:00
Speaker 1 :on your


0:28:02
Speaker 0 :butt on your back yes i'm very i'm very
 flexible so i have good my rubber guard is pretty you go toright yeah i have good arm bars and good
 triangles off my back but um i also have a very good half guardbut my top game is my best i have
 i have a very strong top game you have a

0:28:18
Speaker 1 :hashtag card
 you have a preference of like what kind of guard and how to pass that guard anduh like yeah like is there a specific
 game plan like you would you double

0:28:28
Speaker 0 :under hooks from half guard is the game
 plan for me if i can get double underhooksfrom half guard i could sweep a lot of
 people

0:28:36
Speaker 1 :under hooks of what sorry the arms are


0:28:39
Speaker 0 :so half guard
 lock down right half card go into lock downdouble under hooks got it clinched to
 the body suck the body into the type pressure and yeah massive pressure andthen
 inch my way into a position we call the dog fightand inch my way to a position where i
 could get the person on their back

0:28:56
Speaker 1 :yeah that's what because you did show me
 i still disagree with you about the thai thingum that you can choke so wrong so wrong


0:29:04
Speaker 0 :uh well it's not wrong with you with you
 it's wrong because

0:29:08
Speaker 1 :you you know i think there's a system
 where i i've have this thing with donna here we're gonna figure it out

0:29:13
Speaker 0 :okay but uh let's have a little velcro
 in the back

0:29:16
Speaker 1 :let's see that's you're just not
 cheating you're not you're the exact that's cheatinguh yeah you did i did feel when you
 showed me i think you showed me the rubber guardbecause it's still a god that's a little
 bit foreign to me i just felt that you can immediatelyfeel not with the rubber guard just but
 the way you move your body is you're um like a shanji type of guy whoknows how to control another human being
 so like some people are a little bit morei would say agile and technic like
 playful and kind of loose loose and they work ontransition transition transition
 you're a control guy like you know how to control position in an advancedposition
 donahue is the same way he's all about

0:29:58
Speaker 0 :control my game is smush
 that's my game smush you grab a hold of you once i have you why would i let yougo
 that's my thought is like why would i let you go i just want to incrementallymove to a better position
 until i can strangle you but i'm much moreinto strangling people than anything


0:30:15
Speaker 1 :else yeah which is a great mma
 approach for jiu jitsu well too many

0:30:19
Speaker 0 :people don't
 tap when you get their arms you know and i'm it's noti'm not opposed to arm bars i love arm
 bars but everybody goes to sleep

0:30:29
Speaker 1 :yep and and quit from pressure too i
 mean yeah quit mentally that's nothing like you

0:30:36
Speaker 0 :can't breathe
 you know if you got a guy who's like a really good top game guy and he mountsyou
 and i'm a big fan of mounting with my legs crossedyou know like a guard like a top guard
 and so i can squeeze with both legs smush and i'm just i'm just lookingfor people to make mistakes and slowly
 incrementally bettering my position until i can get something locked upyeah i love jiu jitsu though man i just
 wish it didn't injure you yeah you know jiu-jitsu is like if yourjoints were more durable
 they could figure out a way to make joints more durable god i could do jiujitsu forever


0:31:11
Speaker 1 :yeah so much fun i actually i talked to
 this uh roboticist russ tedrick he buildsone of the world-class people that
 builds humanoid robots you're interested in boston dynamics yeah they keep peoplein that kind of robotics so i asked him
 the stupidest question of like how far are we we from uh having a robotbe a ufc champion
 and uh yeah it's actually a really really tough problem it's it's it's thesame
 thing that you know makes somebody like danielle comey like on the wrestlingside
 special because you have to understand the movement of the human bodyin ways that so difficult to teach it's
 so it's so subtle the timing the pressure points like the leverageall those kinds of things that's just
 for the clinch situation and then the movement for thestriking
 is very difficult as long as you're not allowed as a robotto like use your natural abilities of
 having a lot more power right a lot more

0:32:03
Speaker 0 :power and
 more durable right the human body like especially meniscuslike like you see the the heel hook game
 like everybody's involved in leg locks and heel hooks likeall those guys wind up with torched
 knees everyone's got torched knees everyone's knees are torn apartyou and you don't grow new meniscus you
 know that's like one of those joints whereman when it goes this is and those guys
 are 28 years old blown out knees let me ask the

0:32:31
Speaker 1 :ridiculous question what do you think
 we're talking about cops what do you think uh is the best martial arts forself-defense


0:32:37
Speaker 0 :for sure jiu-jitsu yeah wrestling right
 i think grappling i should say with judo as well especially in a coldclimate if you get someone who's got
 like a heavy winter jacket on my god like judo is an incredible

0:32:50
Speaker 1 :

0:32:52
Speaker 0 :plus concrete that's the worst place to
 be with a heavy winter jacket with a judospecialist and you're standing up with
 them oh my god but i think grappling becausein most self-defense situations it
 usually winds up with grappling you're definitely betteroff though knowing some striking
 because there's nothing more terrifying than when you go to take someone downthey actually have takedown skills
 but they can fight and so they have takedown defenseand they know how to fight and then you
 don't know how to stand up like the worst thing in the world seeing someonelike reaching who doesn't know how to
 do striking and someone cracks you what

0:33:25
Speaker 1 :about all that
 krav maga talk which is like you know the whole line of argument that saysthat jiu jitsu and wrestling and all
 these sports they fundamentally take you away fromthe nature of violence
 so they're just teaching you how to play versus the reality of of umviolence that is involved in like a
 self-defense situation that is is a totally different set of

0:33:51
Speaker 0 :skills would be needed in general the
 people that say that jiu-jitsu or other martial artsdon't they it's more of a sport and they
 don't really understand and they don't really understandviolence in general the people that say
 that suck yeah that's anybody who thinks likesomeone's like you know hey man i'll
 just bite you i'm like are you gonna bite me okay doyou think i'm gonna bite you too what do
 you think of that what if i punch you in your [ __ ] faceyou think you're still gonna bite me
 when you can't even see yeah when you you you barely even knowyou're alive and i
 choke you unconscious if someone's really good at jiu jitsugood luck stabbing them with your keys
 you know you don't have a chance you don't have a chance if someone's muchbetter you and they trip you and get you
 on your back and then they [ __ ] elbow you in yourface and get a head and arm choke on you
 all that krav maga it's out the window son you're waybetter off learning what works on train
 killers like this whole idea that you're goingto poke some of the eye and then you're
 going to kick him in the nuts and like you're you're going through thesedrills that yeah it's good to know
 what to do if you run into someone who doesn't know how to fightit's way better to know what to do to
 someone who knows how to fight that's the best thing learn how to fightagainst people who know how to fight
 like all that practice self-defense and they're gonna it's gonna come at youwith a knife you're gonna grab the wrist
 and do that like it's good to know self-defensebut it's much more important to
 understand martial arts comprehensively when you understandmartial arts comprehensively
 like there's no crop i shouldn't say there's no krav maga guys but it'sit would be shocking if a krav maga guy
 and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight and the mixed martial arts guy was atrained killer all around
 didn't [ __ ] that guy up that's that's what i would expect would happeni would i would i would not think that
 some guy who has a little bit of this and a littlebit of that and prepares for the streets
 is going to be able to handle a person who trains with killerson a day-to-day basis who rolls with jiu
 jitsu black belts who trains with muay thai champions likehere
 it's the best martial arts of the martial arts that work on martialartists
 not the martial arts that work on untrained people what about

0:36:06
Speaker 1 :we're in texas now what about guns


0:36:09
Speaker 0 :

0:36:10
Speaker 1 :that's the best martial art no but would
 you like uh in this crazy time should peoplecarry guns it's not a bad idea to have a


0:36:17
Speaker 0 :gun
 because if you need a gun you have a gun and if you don't need a gunif you're a person with self-control
 you're not going to use it you're not going to justrandomly use it but you have something
 to protect you this is the whole idea of the second amendmentthe whole idea of the second amendment
 gets distorted by mass shootings or by terrible people murder people and doterrible things but
 it's that's all those things are real but they don't take awayfrom the fundamental efficacy
 of having a firearm and defending your family or defending your lifeand there are real live situations where
 people have had firearms and it's protected themor their loved ones or they've stopped
 shooters there's there's many of these stories but peopledon't like those stories because then it
 it tends to lead to this gun culture argument is pro-gun culture argumentthat people find very uncomfortable it's
 it's human beings are messy and we're messy in so many differentways right we're messy
 uh emotionally we're messy messy physically but we're also messy inwhat's
 good or bad what's we want things to be binary we want things to beright or wrong you know one or zero and
 they're not but but there is crime in the world andthere is violence in the world and
 you're better off knowing how to fight and you're betting betteroff knowing how to defend yourself and
 you're better off having a gun

0:37:39
Speaker 1 :and yeah i generally think that guns i
 do like the idea that guns second amendmenthelps protect the first amendment
 there's a kind of sense that makes puts me at ease knowingthat so many people in this country have
 guns that uh i mean alex jones i justlistened to one episode of infowars
 for the first time boy is he he reminds me like when idrank some tequila i felt like i'm going
 to some dark places today that's how i feel like listening to himbut uh
 he talks about like that it's he worries about martial lawso basically government overreach by
 which happened throughout history like there's there's somethingto worry about
 there but it's it puts me at ease knowing that so much of the populationhas guns that people government would
 think twice before uh instituting martial law oncities
 but i actually was asking almost like on the individual leveli maybe shouldn't say this but i don't
 yet own a gun and i felt that if i carry a gunstatistically just for me as a human
 knowing my psychology i feel like i'm more likely to dielike i feel like i would put myself in
 situations that i shouldn't like the way i i willsee the world will change
 because my natural feeling is like when somebody when i was in phillyand i knew late at night in west philly
 when some guy looks at you you can immediately calculate that this is adangerous human being
 there it starts with a monkey look at first likei'm a bigger monkey than you and that's
 where i found like for example i'll do the beta thing of just looking down andturning away
 and just getting out of trouble like very politelyand basically that kind of approach
 because if you have a in terms of getting out of serious violencesituations like serious
 something where you could die versus if i had a gun i feel like i would want tobe
 that that would be that cowboy monkey thing where i would want to put myselfin situations
 where i'm a little bit of a savior even of myselfand almost create danger which
 can no longer like the escalation of whichi can no longer control well you're


0:39:56
Speaker 0 :talking about taking a gun somewhere
 versus having a gun in your home yes yes

0:40:00
Speaker 1 :i mean carry on me that's a different


0:40:02
Speaker 0 :situation and much harder
 to get a warrant for or a license for thatyou know control concealed carry
 licenses especially in massachusetts they don't come easy a little message

0:40:12
Speaker 1 :yeah that's a whole nother thing
 yeah you're saying gun in the home yeah

0:40:16
Speaker 0 :a gun in the home
 having a gun having knowing how to use a gun like i know how to use a gun i'vetrained you know many hours learning how
 to shoot a gun at tactical places you know there's abunch of videos of me
 doing it on uh instagram i i practice and i think it's good to to understandhow to be accurate


0:40:36
Speaker 1 :so i've been a fan of your podcast for a
 long time you don't often talk about it because you're always kind of lookingforward but if you look at the old
 studio they just left is there some epic memories that standout to you
 that you like you almost look back i can't believe this happened

0:40:53
Speaker 0 :oh yeah almost too many of them to count
 is that something that pops into mine

0:40:57
Speaker 1 :

0:40:58
Speaker 0 :now all of them elon musk blowing that
 flamethrower in the middle of the hallway i got a video of thathave you seen the video of it yeah yeah


0:41:05
Speaker 1 :i think you posted on instagram i think
 i did too

0:41:07
Speaker 0 :yeah he's a madman um having bernie
 sanders in there uh you know just uh all the fun fightcompanions we did and all the
 crazy podcasts with joey diaz and duncan trussell andthere were so many there were so many
 moments you know it's um podcast is this is a weird art formand it almost seems like it sounds silly
 but it almost seems like something that chose me rather than i chose iti think of that all the time in some
 strange way it's like i'm i'm showing up as like an antennaand i just plug in and twist twist on
 and then i i take in the thing and i put ittogether and i'm
 like a passenger of this weird ride yeah

0:41:49
Speaker 1 :you you've talked about this before i
 really like this idea of that human beings arejust carriers of these ideas
 yeah ideas are the ones who are breeding yeah in a sense like the idea foundyou as a useful brain to use to spread
 itself through the podcasting medium yeah something that that's aon uh but did because when i think about
 your podcast i think about joey diaz i think about all those comedians you'vehad
 i mean i think you've had joey on i mean maybe close to50 times some crazy number is there
 i mean he's over the top offensive just that's who he is to the core isthere
 some sense where you you wondered like whether it's right tohave
 the spotify episode number one with duncan dressler

0:42:45
Speaker 0 :that's why we wore nasa suits and we got
 high as [ __ ] it's like that's the whole idea behind

0:42:53
Speaker 1 :it i mean can you introspect that a
 little bit like can you think like what is that because that's rareit's such a rare thing to do because
 they they're you're not supposed to talk to duncantrussell
 with a huge platform that you have five

0:43:07
Speaker 0 :hours why not


0:43:09
Speaker 1 :because donald trump apparently watches
 your podcast

0:43:13
Speaker 0 :

0:43:13
Speaker 1 :so so just the idea that there's these i
 mean that's what i think about you know these ceos write to me thatthey listen to the podcast that
 that i do and i have somebody like a david fravorand i was nervous about it i was nervous
 to have a conversation for me david fravor is a duncan trestle whichis like


0:43:33
Speaker 0 :just because of his experiences with the
 ufos

0:43:37
Speaker 1 :yeah just even just the way he sees the
 world because he is open i don't know if he's always likethis but he opened himself to the
 possibility of unconventional ideas most people inthe scientific community kind of
 say well i don't really want to believe anything that doesn't have a lot of hardevidence
 right and so that was to me like a step and as the thing somehowbecomes more popular that it becomes
 this fear of like well should i talk to this person or notand i mean you're an inspiration and
 saying like do whatever the hell you

0:44:07
Speaker 0 :want
 you have to well first of all i have what you call [ __ ] you money andif you have [ __ ] you money you don't say
 [ __ ] you what's the point of having the [ __ ] you moneyyou're wasting it like you're wasting
 the position like someone said to me like why do you why do youlike sports cars so much like how many
 cars do you have a bunch of cars so becauseif i was a kid and i said hey if i was
 that crazy rich famous guy like i don't want to have a bunch ofcool [ __ ] cars like so i
 so i would do that like because that not everybody gets to do that like if you'rethe person that gets to do that
 you're kind of supposed to do it like that's if you if you want toif that really does speak to you and you
 know um i've talked to you about this before butmuscle cars
 specifically once from the 1960s and the early 70s they speak to me in some weirdway man i could just stare at them
 like i have a 65 corvette i walk around it sometimes at night when no one'saround


0:45:03
Speaker 1 :what's your favorite muscle car like
 what's your most badass late 60s the

0:45:09
Speaker 0 :probably that car probably that 65
 corvette yeah i walk around it when no one's around i

0:45:15
Speaker 1 :think i've during the 69 corvette is
 there a particular year

0:45:19
Speaker 0 :that uh just 65 is uh generation two
 69 is generation three 69 is like the it's even more curvy they're bothawesome just awesome in different ways
 but i just love muscle cars for whatever reasonbut but the point is like i like what i
 like and if i can do what i want to do i should do what i want to do and it'snot hurting anybody and
 the thing is like i would do the duncan podcast if no one was listening rightright if it was if we were just starting
 to do a podcast together and uh no one cared and it got like 2000 views which
 we did for years a long time i would do

0:45:52
Speaker 1 :

0:45:53
Speaker 0 :it with duncan and we would get high and
 we'd talk crazy [ __ ] about aliens and spaceships andmaybe dude maybe ideas are living life
 forms and they're inside your head and that's how things getman yeah man i've
 just kind of morphed me and him together in that because thelife form ideal life form idea is mine
 that i've i've really really think about a lot i think about a

0:46:14
Speaker 1 :technical side by the way like uh
 i when i heard you say that because i've been thinking i was likeoh whoa that's interesting that it might


0:46:21
Speaker 0 :be they might be alive
 because they i don't know what the [ __ ] they are but when someone has anidea for uh you know whatever an
 invention a toaster and then they think about this all itneed is like these heating elements and
 a spring and then it pops on the stunts i have atimer and then they build this thing now
 also it's alive it's like you manifested it in aphysical form a toaster is not the best
 example but a car a airplane you're thinking about athing like an idea comes into your head
 and you can say oh well it's just creativity it's a part of being a personthat's how we invented
 tools and how you know we became better hunters all those things are trueit's i'm not saying that there's some
 magic to what i'm saying but there's also a possibility thatwe're
 simplifying something by saying that it's just creativitythat it's just a natural human
 inclination to invent things but why is it possiblethat ideas like creativity like we are
 the only animal other than there's a few species thatcreate things like
 bees make bee hives and but it's very they're very uniformyou know some animals use tools you know
 like you know chimps will use like sticks to gettermites and things like that but
 there's something about what we do that's it makes you wonder because welook at this
 just look at this room that we're in look at all these electronicslook at all this crazy [ __ ] that human
 beings have invented and then built upon othersinventions improved and innovated
 these all came out of ideas like the the ideathey it germinates in someone's head it
 bounces around they write it down they share it with others the otherpeople who have similar ideas or ideas
 that are complementary they work togetherand they they change the world and the


0:48:12
Speaker 1 :new thing in that is the idea is not the
 people it's like we think we found the ideas but it's more like the ideasthe ideas found us fine you yeah they're


0:48:19
Speaker 0 :literally in the
 in the air yeah they come to you i always felt like that with bitslike when i come up with a bit that's
 why i'm i'm always telling people about the stephen pressfield book the war ofart because he talks about uh respecting
 the muse and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down andyou do the work or you sit down like a
 professional and you you talk to the muse like come tell mewhat to do like if the muse was a real
 thing as if it amuses like a some mystical creature that comes anddelivers you ideas
 even if that's not real that's how it works yeahit does work like that if you do treat
 it like it's a muse and you treat it with the respect andyou you treat it like a professional
 the ideas do come to you i never thought

0:49:05
Speaker 1 :about what he's doing he's just sitting
 there waiting for the idea that's trying to breed tofind him
 yeah there's that's a that's a trippy thing if you show off trippy

0:49:14
Speaker 0 :if you show up and put in the time and
 focus your energy on that the the ideas they will arrivethat will arrive and that's the same
 with writing comedy like there's been many many times where i'll come homefrom the comedy store
 and i just sit down and start writing and i just i've i got nothing there'snothing there i'm just writing it's all
 [ __ ] nothing's good it's just like hmm andthen all of a sudden
 bam there's the idea melson i can't stop and then you know acouple hours later and i'm like whoa
 and then the next night i'm on stage and i'm like how about thatboom it gets this big laugh i'm like
 holy [ __ ] and i know that came out of thediscipline to sit down and call the muse


0:49:57
Speaker 1 :i mean the cool thing is the ideas have
 found you to like oh i'm going to use this dudelike
 he seems to have a podcast that's popular yeah i'm going to breed insidehis brain
 yeah and spread it to others yeah an

0:50:11
Speaker 0 :or an inventor you know i'm going to use
 this guy who's like desperately seeking some sort of aa product to bring to market some guy
 who wants to invent things he's thinking about inventing things all the timelike these ideas that weasel their way
 into your head and it seems to me also thatyour your the frequency that your mind
 operates under has to be correct because one of the things about creativity seemsto be if you think about yourself a lot
 if you're really into yourself or your imageor or you're selfish those ideas
 are not they don't find you yes that's funny

0:50:46
Speaker 1 :the creative yeah yes it stifles the
 opportunity that the idea has for defining

0:50:52
Speaker 0 :yes which is one of the reasons why joke
 thieves people that steal jokes are terrible writersthere's never like really good writers
 who are also joke thieves it's just joke thieves and then you know when theyhave to write on their own if they get
 exposed they become terrible comedians they'reof a shadow of what they were when they
 were stealing other people's ideas because the thing that would make yousteal a person's idea
 is that ego part the the like the wanting to claim it for yourself towanting to be the man
 i'm gonna or the woman you know you want to be the person who gets out there thatsays it and
 everybody's gonna love me for it like you can't think like that and becreative
 it requires a humility and it requires a detachment from self in order to createlike
 when i'm writing i'm blank i'm like i'm just staring i'm likei'm just the part of my mind that's
 active is not like me it's like this weird corefunction
 part where i'm not i'm not aware of my personality i'm not aware i'm notaware of anything
 i'm just trying to put it together in a way that i know works

0:51:59
Speaker 1 :and just being there being present yeah
 pressfield is just i'm a big believer just sitting thereyou're not staring at a blank page
 putting in the time

0:52:08
Speaker 0 :yeah and sometimes it's not that way
 sometimes it's an inspiration like sometimes i'll be sitting thereat dinner and i'll be like i'll be right
 i got an idea and my wife is really cool about that i'm like i have an idea and ii have to just run out of the room real
 quick and i write it down on my phone and then i can come backyou know because those are those are
 like little gifts that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhereand some people rely only on those gifts
 you know and i've talked to comics about it like i can't come on my best ideaswhen i don't write i'm like no
 i do too i come up with great ideas when i don't write but i also writelike you can do both of those things
 they're not mutually exclusive

0:52:44
Speaker 1 :you mentioned [ __ ] you money i i feel
 like i have [ __ ] you money now a year ago i was at zero i have [ __ ] youmoney now because
 probably my standards my i i don't need much in this worldbut because also probably because of you
 uh but it's 300 to 400 000 people listen toevery episode
 i do and a lot and that result is weird it'sa successful television show on cable


0:53:08
Speaker 0 :

0:53:10
Speaker 1 :yeah it's crazy but it's all you
 it's yeah it's hilarious that's amazing but at this pointthat also resulted in fu money in a
 sense that i don't um you know i don't needanything else in this world but so
 by way of asking i've looked up if you've inspired me for a long timedo you have advice you've done this
 on the podcast side of life do you have advicefor somebody like for me and somebody
 like me going on this journey eric weinstein isgoing on this journey
 is there advice both small and big that you have for somebodylike me


0:53:50
Speaker 0 :the advice is to keep doing what feels
 right to you and do what you're doing obviously it'sresonating with people if you're getting
 that big of an audience and i've listened to your podcast you're verygood at it so
 just keep doing it the way you're doing it um don't let anybody else

0:54:07
Speaker 1 :get involved what about you've connected
 i think you met jamie at the comedy store

0:54:11
Speaker 0 :i met him at the ice house at the ice
 house well i think i met him at the comedy store but then uh we talkedat the ice house i mean what you'd have


0:54:18
Speaker 1 :to ask him yeah did you think deeply
 about because like you know you basically havenobody on your team
 and and so it almost feels like a marriage where is itwere you selective about like a jam to
 somebody to bring into your little circle

0:54:33
Speaker 0 :well jamie's exceptional he is he truly


0:54:36
Speaker 1 :he's a special
 i mean he might have grown i don't remember how he was in the early daysmaybe you could say but


0:54:42
Speaker 0 :he's definitely better at it but he
 right away he's exceptional he's got very little ego yes he'she's not a guy who needs a lot of
 attention he's not a guy who um overestimatesuh anything like in terms of like a
 negative or positive like his uh like his his interpretationof
 whether it's uh good things that happen to the show or bad things that happenthe show he just takes it all
 like flat he's chill he's just cool as [ __ ] and he's so smartand he's so good as an audio engineer
 and as a podcast producer

0:55:19
Speaker 1 :he's the best but he's basically one of
 the only people on you on this whole team soyeah how do you find i mean when you let
 people in i mean i'm sure other people wanted toget involved like why don't you have a
 co-host like you basically kind of well do you

0:55:34
Speaker 0 :well here's the problem with the co-host
 like when you and i are talking when we're talkingi'm tuned in to you and i'm waiting
 to hear what you're saying and i'm listening and i'm interpreting itand then i'm calculating whether or not
 i have anything to say whether to let you keep talking whetheri maybe have a question that lets you
 expand further or whether i have a disagreement or likethere's a dance
 that's going on now when there's another person there chiming in tooit [ __ ] the dance up it's like dancing
 like if you're doing an uh a dance with someone you know like ifyou're
 slow dancing with someone and then a third person's there stepping onyour feet sometimes it's fun yeah
 sometimes having a third person is fun comedy podcast sometimes it's fun umkind of structured yeah debate
 structures but even then it gets difficult because people talk over eachother and
 also um i find that without headphones it's way easier to talk over each otheryou make mistakes yeah you don't
 you don't hear it the same way when you have headphones you i hear what you hearit's all one sound and i the audience
 hears exactly or rather i hear exactly whatthe audience hears
 whether it's over here my voice is louder than yours because you're overthere
 and if i don't have headphones on it doesn't it's not all together

0:56:54
Speaker 1 :on that point one of the interesting
 things about your show is uh you don't almost never have done andyou just generally don't do remote like
 um sorry not remote calls but you don't go to another person's location

0:57:08
Speaker 0 :like you have only done a few a small
 handful and then just like uh will the

0:57:11
Speaker 1 :sapolsky he should be
 yeah he should do this but actually we went back and forth on email i told himhe needs to get your his ass back in
 in this in the studio uh he's working on a book i was a fan of his

0:57:21
Speaker 0 :a long time ago because i became
 obsessed with toxoplasmosis you know and uh i uh i've reached out tohim
 a long time ago before he uh was willing to do it but theni caught him in downtown l.a he was
 there for something else and i just greedily snatched up an hour of histime


0:57:41
Speaker 1 :well he doesn't get i think some of
 those folks don't get how much magic can happen in this podcast studio likebigger than anything they've ever done
 in terms of their work not i'm not talking about reach but interms of the discovery of new ideas
 there's something magical about conversationlike that like somebody as brilliant as
 him if he gives himself over to theconversation for multiple hours at a
 time that's another place where you've beenan inspiration where i like
 you know i'm getting more and more confident of telling peoplelike an elon musk that like you know a
 lot of ceos are like well he has 30 minutes on his schedule i'mlike no
 three hours

0:58:22
Speaker 0 :[Laughter]


0:58:25
Speaker 1 :and then they're like so some say no and
 then they come back these people have started coming back to like okaywe're starting to get it they start to
 get it and you're a rare beacon of hope in that sense thatthere's some value in long form
 they think that nobody wants to listen for 30 for more than 30 minutesthey think like i have nothing to say
 but the reality is if you just give yourself over to likethe three hours just let it go
 three hours four hours whatever it is there's so muchto discover about what you didn't even
 know you think

0:58:58
Speaker 0 :yeah yeah you have to be confident that
 you could do it and uh in the beginning i just did itbecause that's what i wanted to do
 and no one was listening so i've always been a curious person so i've alwaysi've always
 been interested in listening to how people think about thingsand how and talking to people about
 their mindset and just and expanding on my own ideasand just talking
 [ __ ] and so we would have these podcasts and they would go on forever andmy my friend ari i've i never let him
 die and never let this die down i've let him uh forget this he was always likeyou have to edit your podcast i'm
 telling you right now you're [ __ ] up i go why he's like because people arenot going to listen to it i go they
 don't have to yeah i go you listen to part of it hegoes he goes just do it just i'm telling
 you trust me cut it down to like 45 minutes that'sall you need and i'm like no
 no i don't think you're right i i like listening to long-form things no oneknows that kind of time
 i go okay i'm going to do it i'm just going to keep doing it this way so

1:00:02
Speaker 1 :

1:00:02
Speaker 0 :and it it sticks too good no he doesn't
 listen to his these are like two and a half hours long now

1:00:07
Speaker 1 :you won but you wouldn't like say i
 mentioned to you this before this is gonna happen it's actually madea lot of progress toys i'm gonna
 talk to putin but you wouldn't travel to putin if you want to talk to you

1:00:19
Speaker 0 :putin is a dangerous character he's not


1:00:22
Speaker 1 :

1:00:22
Speaker 0 :he's not you're talking to ever seen the
 thing with uh jerry craft where they stole his super bowl ring yeah

1:00:28
Speaker 1 :yeah that was i think that was a little
 bit of a misunderstanding oh really

1:00:32
Speaker 0 :i think it's a little bit he just
 decided he's going to steal that super bowl ring

1:00:36
Speaker 1 :kind of i think that was a kind of he


1:00:38
Speaker 0 :thought can i see your ring
 he shows him his ring then he puts it on says i can murder somebody with thisring so he and then he walks off with it


1:00:45
Speaker 1 :it's possibly he did it
 uh as a he's a big believer in displays of poweryeah so like it's possible he did that
 but on i think he sees himself as like a toolwith which to demonstrate that russia
 still belongs on the stage of the big playersand so he a lot of action is selected
 through that lens but in terms of a human beingoutside of any of the evils that uh he
 may or may not have done he is a really thoughtful intelligentfun human being like the wit uh
 and the depth from the jre perspective is really interesting i'm like hismanager now selling


1:01:30
Speaker 0 :the he's a judo trying to get trump he's
 really good at judo i i have seen him practice judo he'she's a legit black belt and not only


1:01:36
Speaker 1 :that
 he loves it not just skill wise but to talk about it to reason about it tothink about it
 to mma as well so yeah maybe it'd be a good conversation but you

1:01:49
Speaker 0 :wouldn't travel to him


1:01:51
Speaker 1 :well this holds your principle so that's
 the core of the advice

1:01:56
Speaker 0 :or whatever i would rather here's the
 thing there's not a person that i have to haveon the show right
 and i'm happy to talk to anybody i'm just as happy to talk to youas i am to talk to trump as i am
 probably more happy to talk to you as i am to talk to mike tyson as i am totalk to joey diaz i like talking to
 people i enjoy doing podcasts i enjoy talkingto a variety of people
 and i schedule them based on i want to likei try not to get too many right-wing
 people in a row or too many progressive people in a row i don't want to getrepetitive
 i try not get too many fighters in a row i try to balance it out not too manycomedians
 comedians are the one one group where i can have three four in a row five in arow because that's my tribe
 you know those are my people it's easy we could talk about anythingit's a weird dance you know the
 conversations that you're doing on a podcast arethere they're a strange dance and you
 want to you know you want to not step on yourown feet and you want to make sure that
 you do it in a way do the podcast in a waythat's entertaining for people and
 it's it's the conversations are learning how totalk to me it's a weird skill yeah it's
 a weird skill that took a long time for me to get good atand i didn't know it was a skill until i
 started doing it and then i i just thought you were just talkinglike i was just i know how to talk we'll
 just talk to people and then along the way i realized like ohand then when you talk to people that
 are bad at it you realize that it's a skilllike particularly one of the things
 about my people about comedians is a lot ofthem tend to want to talk but don't want
 to listen right so they're waiting for youto stop talking so they can talk but
 they're not necessarily thinking about what you're sayingyou know and they're just just waiting
 for their opportunity or they talk over you or theyand i try real hard not to do that
 sometimes i fail but my when i'm at my best i'mi'm dancing yeah ultimately the skill


1:03:55
Speaker 1 :conversation is just
 really listening mm-hmm like really and listening and thinking

1:04:02
Speaker 0 :listening and thinking and being like
 genuinely curious and and really having um you knowa take on what they're saying and and uh
 and maybe a follow-up question or maybe you know just got it's got to be realit's got to be authentic
 and when it is authentic and it's real it resonates with people like they'relistening and they go oh
 like i'm locked in with the way you're thinking like you two guysare in a conversation and i'm locked in
 you know when she talks and you listen i i'm listening to you know when he sayssomething to her when she says something
 to to him like there's a thing that happensduring conversations where
 you're there like you're listening to and it'swith me when i listen to a good podcast
 i feel like i'm in the room i feel like i'm in the room and i'm likelike i'm like the friend that got to sit
 down and listen like oh yeah it's a great conversationyeah
 you know i love conversations so i love listening to themand i love putting them together and the
 fact that this podcast has gotten so [ __ ] big it it's stunning to me itblows me away
 i never anticipated it never thought for a secondthat that stupid thing that i used to do
 in my couch in my my office was the biggest thing i'veever done in my life
 by far like people used to make fun of it like there's a comedy storedocumentary that's coming out
 and one of the parts of the documentary is my friend tom segurawhen he first started doing my podcast
 he would he would be leaving and he would talk to red band he's like whatthe [ __ ] is he doing
 yeah like why is he doing this like who's listening he's like oh some peoplelike it yeah
 and it's like [ __ ] nonsense waste of time and likein the the documentary it shows like 2
 000 views like one of the early ustream

1:05:45
Speaker 1 :episodes hilarious and they don't just
 like it really they uh they form a friendship with youit's like uh
 even me when people come up to me like the love in their eyes is kind ofbeautiful
 it's weird right yeah it's like you're part of their life yeahand it i don't know it's it's also
 heartbreaking because you realize you'll never really get toknow them back
 like because they they clearly are friends with you

1:06:10
Speaker 0 :yes yeah and it's sad to see a person


1:06:11
Speaker 1 :who's clearly brilliant and interesting
 and is friends with you but you don't get achance to return
 that love and uh i mean my kids it took

1:06:21
Speaker 0 :them a while
 to figure out what's going on but uh people come up to meand uh you know they would say something
 like hey man i [ __ ] love you thanks man all right hey brother nice tomeet you my daughter was like sick she's
 like do you know him yeah i'm like no i don't know him she'slike how does he know you
 think this is a very weird conversation i used to have with young kidswhen i'd explained i do this thing
 called the podcast and millions of people listen so now one ofmy daughters is 12
 and one of her friends is 13 and he's a boy and he goes to school with her andhe's obsessed with me
 and so she's weirded out and she says to him i don't think you like me i thinkyou're just into my dad
 [ __ ] weirdo she's gonna have that

1:07:06
Speaker 1 :conversation in a few stages in her life


1:07:09
Speaker 0 :

1:07:10
Speaker 1 :oh that hard conversation with a
 boyfriend yeah

1:07:12
Speaker 0 :probably yeah that well that's the thing
 about men too this this podcast um is uhmy podcast is uniquely masculine i'm a
 man and i'm i'm not i i'm also a man thatdoesn't have to go through some sort of
 a corporate filter i'm not going through executiveproducers who tell me don't
 don't have this guest on don't talk about that you know that we looked atfocus groups and they don't they don't
 seem to like when you do this like there's none of that i just and i ii just do it
 so if that's so i have a whole podcast where i just talk about carsand people like i don't want to hear you
 talk about cars well good congratulationsyou found what you like here's good news
 there's 1500 other ones go listen to the other episodes where idon't talk about cars you know you don't
 have to listen

1:08:00
Speaker 1 :and it's not like your brand you just no
 are who you are and that's what you do

1:08:04
Speaker 0 :but it's like it's authentically
 what i'm interested in all the podcasts whether i'm talkingto david fravor about his experience
 with ufos whether i'm talking to david sinclair about life extensionwhether i'm talking to you about
 artificial intelligence or what it's because i want totalk to these people and that that
 resonates i i like when people are into [ __ ] youknow i've talked about this before like
 things that i have no interest in making furniturebut i like this pbs show where this guy
 makes furniture by hand yeah i love watching it craftsman because he's sointo it yeah he's examining this and
 polishing that i'm not gonna do that i don't give a [ __ ] about furniturefurniture for me is function like this
 desk function it works but i love when people are into it youknow and i'm happy that someone can make
 it and they do a great job but i'm not i'm not interested in thethe task is or the even the finished
 product as much as i'm interested in someone's passion for something

1:09:01
Speaker 1 :the passion that they've put into this
 that shines through last question i sometimes ask this justfor to
 uh what is it to challenge to make people roll their eyes to makelegitimate scientists roll their eyes
 ask what is the meaning of life according to joe rogan i do not think

1:09:23
Speaker 0 :there is a meaning
 i think there's many many meanings of life i think there's a way to navigatelife that's enjoyable
 i think it requires many things it requires first of allrequires love you have to have loved
 ones you have to have family you have to have friends you have tohave people that care about you
 and you have to care about them i think that is primarythen it also requires interests
 there has to be things that stimulate you now it could be just a subsistencelifestyle there's many people that
 believe and practice this uh lifestyle of justliving off the land and hunting and
 fishing and living in the woods and they seem incredibly happyyeah and there's there's something to be
 said for that that is an interest right there's something and there's athere's a direct connection between
 their actions and their sustenance they get their foodthat way they're connected to nature and
 it's very satisfying for them if you don't have that uh i think youneed
 something that is interesting to you something that'syou're passionate about and there's far
 too many people that get sucked into living a life where you're just doing ajob
 you're just showing up and putting in your time and then going home but youdon't have a passion
 for what you're doing and i think that is that's the recipe for a boringand very unfulfilling life you mentioned


1:10:44
Speaker 1 :love difficult
 backtrack what uh we talked about the demons and the violencein there somewhere what's the role of
 love in this in your own life it's very important man

1:10:55
Speaker 0 :and that's one of the reasons why i'm so
 uh i'm so interested in helping people i'm very interested in people feelinggood
 i like them to feel good i want to help them i like i like doing things thatmake them feel like oh you care about me
 like yeah i care about you i really do like i want people to feelgood i want
 my family to feel good i want my friends to feel good i want guests to feelgood about the podcast experience you
 know i i am i'm a big believer in as much as ican to spread
 positive energy and joy and happiness and and relay all the good advice thati've ever gotten
 all the things that i've learned and if they can benefit people and i find thatthose things benefit people
 and actually improve the quality of their life or improve their successor improve their relationships or i'm
 very happy to do that that means a lot to me the the way weinteract with each other
 is so important it's one of the reasons why likeif someone gets cancelled or you get
 publicly shamed it's so devastating because there's all these people thatnegative all this negative energy coming
 your way and you feel it as much as you like to pretend that youyou're immune to that kind of stuff and
 some people do like to pretend that you feel it there's a there's a tangibleforce when people are upset at you
 and that's the same with loved ones or familyor anytime someone's upset at you
 whether it's a giant group of people or there's a small amount of people thathas an impact on you
 and your psyche and your physical being so the moreyou can spread love and the more love
 comes back to you you also create this butterfly effectright because where
 other people start recognizing like oh you know when he is nice to mei feel better and i'm going to be nicer
 to people and when i'm nicer to people they feel better and i feel better andand it spreads outward and that's one
 thing that i've done through this podcasti think is i've i've imparted my
 personal philosophy on in in kindness and generosity toother people


1:12:57
Speaker 1 :yeah i mean to correct you you didn't do
 it the ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain have[ __ ]


1:13:03
Speaker 0 :up the ideas that are all alive in the
 air made their way into my head love is a

1:13:07
Speaker 1 :more efficient mechanism of spreading
 ideas they figured out

1:13:12
Speaker 0 :yes probably man
 probably um so as far as like uh the meaning of life that'sthat's a bit without that you have
 nothing you know one of the big biggest failures in life is to beextremely successful financially but
 everybody hates you everybody hates you and you're justmiserable and alone and angry and
 depressed and sad you know when you you hear about richfamous people that commit suicide like
 wow you missed the mark you got some partsright
 but you put too many eggs in one basket you put too many eggs in the financialbasket or the success basket or the
 accomplishment basket and not enough in the friendship andlove basket and there's a balance to
 that and what i talked about the violence andall that stuff like that to me is
 me understanding recognizing that is me trying to achieve that balanceit's so like go kill those demons so
 that this boat is level you know because if it's not then theboat is like this and then everything's
 all [ __ ] up and every time we hit a wave things fall apartbalance that boat out figure it out like
 know who you are some people don't have that problem atall some people they could just go for
 walks and they're cool as a cucumber i need more you know i need kettle bellsi need a heavy bag
 i need uh i need the echo bike you know air assault bike i needsome hardcore [ __ ] and if i don't get
 that i don't feel good so i figured that out too and that makesme a nicer person and that makes my
 interactions nicer it makes it it changes the quality of mymy friendships and my relationships with


1:14:46
Speaker 1 :people i think uh
 we mentioned eurolink i can i can certainlyuh guarantee that this is one of the
 memories i'll be replaying 20 30 years from now once we get thefeature ready joe it's a huge honor to
