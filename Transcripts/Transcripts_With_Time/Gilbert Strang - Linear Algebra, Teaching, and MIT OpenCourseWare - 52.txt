Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Gilbert Strang he's a professor of mathematics at MIT and perhaps one ofthe most famous and impactful teachers
 of math in the world his MIT opencourseware lectures on linearalgebra have been viewed millions of
 times as an undergraduate student I was one of those millions of studentsthere's something inspiring about the
 way he teaches there's at once calm simple and yet full of passion for theelegance inherent to mathematics I
 remember doing the exercises in his book introduction of linear algebra andslowly realizing that the world of
 matrices of vector spaces of determinants and eigenvalues ofgeometric transformations and matrix
 decompositions reveal a set of powerful tools in the toolbox of artificialintelligence from signals to images from
 miracle optimization to robotics computer vision deep learning computergraphics and everywhere outside AI

0:03:51
Speaker 0 :rock stars of mathematics I don't feel
 like a rock star that's kind of crazy for old math person but it's true thatthe videos in linear algebra that I made
 way back in 2000 I think I've been watched a lot and well it's partly theimportance of linear algebra which way
 I'm sure you'll ask me and give me a chance to say that linear algebra as asubject has just surged in importance
 but also I it was a class that I taught a bunch of times so I kind of got itorganized and any I'm enjoy doing it was
 just the videos were just the class so they're on OpenCourseWare andYouTube and translated that's fun but


0:04:38
Speaker 1 :there's something about that chalkboard
 in the and the simplicity of the way you explain the basic concepts in thebeginning I you know to be honest when I
 went to undergrad you know do linear

0:04:50
Speaker 0 :

0:04:51
Speaker 1 :algebra broadly of course this lineage
 I before going through the course at my university I was going through opencourseware I was you were my instructor
 oh yeah you're right yeah and that I mean we're using your book and I meanthat that the fact that there is
 thousands you know hundreds of thousands millions of people that watch that videoI think that's yeah that's really
 powerful so how do you think the idea of putting lectures online would really MITOpenCourseWare has innovated that was a


0:05:27
Speaker 0 :wonderful idea
 you know I think the story that I've heard is the committee committee wasappointed by the president president
 vest at that time a wonderful guy and the idea of the committee was to figureout how a mighty could make be like
 other universities market the market work we were doing and then they didn'tsee away and after a weekend and they
 had an inspiration came back to the president vest and said what if we justgave it away and he decided that was ok
 good idea so that's a crazy idea that's

0:06:08
Speaker 1 :uh if we think of a university is a
 thing that creates a product yes isn't knowledge right the you know the kind ofeducational knowledge isn't the products
 and giving that away are you surprised

0:06:24
Speaker 0 :that you went through it the result that
 he did it well knowing a little bit president vest it was like him I thinkand and it was really the right idea
 you know MIT as I kind of it's known for being high level technical things andand this is the best way we can say tell
 we can show what MIT really is like because the thein my case those 1806 videos are just
 teaching the class they were there in 26100 they're kind of fun to look atpeople write to me and say oh you've got
 a sense of humor but I don't know where that comes through somehow I bigfriendly with a class I like students
 and and then your algebra the subject we got to give this subject most of thecredit it it really has come forward and
 importance in these years so let's talk

0:07:29
Speaker 1 :about linear algebra a little bit
 because it is such a it's both a powerful and a beautiful a subfield ofmathematics so what's your favorite
 specific topic in linear algebra or even math in general to give a lecture on toconvey to tell a story to teach students


0:07:49
Speaker 0 :okay well on the teaching side so it's
 not deep mathematics at all but I I'm kind of proud of the idea of the foursubspaces there are four fundamental
 subspaces which are of course known before longbefore my name for them but can you go


0:08:13
Speaker 1 :through them can you go through the


0:08:15
Speaker 0 :future I can yes so the first one to
 understand is so the matrix is maybe I should say the matrix what is the matrixwhat's a matrix well so we have a like a
 rectangle of numbers so it's got n columnsgot a bunch of columns and also got an M
 rows let's say and the relation between so of course the columns and the rowsit's the same numbers so there's got to
 be connections there but they're not simple the they're much the columnsmight be longer than the rows and
 they've all different the numbers are mixed up first space to think about istake the columns so those are vectors
 those are points in n dimensions what's the vector so a physicist would imaginea vector or might imagine a vector as a
 arrow you know in space or the point it ends at in space for me it's a column of

0:09:17
Speaker 1 :numbers does it you often think of this
 is very interesting in terms of linear algebra of a vector you think a littlebit more abstract than the how it's very
 commonly used perhaps yeah you think this arbitrary Speight multi-dimensional

0:09:33
Speaker 0 :right away I'm in high dimensions and in
 the room lands yeah that's right in the lecture I tried a so if you think of twovectors in ten dimensions I'll do this
 in class and I'll readily admit that I have no good image in my mind of avector of arrow int n dimensional space
 but whatever you can a you can add one bunch of ten numbers to another bunch often numbers so you can add a vector to a
 vector and you can multiply a vector by three and that's if you know how to dothose
 you've got linear algebra you know ten

0:10:13
Speaker 1 :dimensions yeah you know there's this
 beautiful thing about math if we look string theory and all these theorieswhich are really fundamentally derived
 through math yeah but it very difficult to visualize it yeah how do you thinkabout the things like a 10 dimensional
 vector that we can't really visualize yeah do you and and yet math reveals

0:10:38
Speaker 0 :some beauty Oh underlying me yeah our


0:10:40
Speaker 1 :world in that weird thing we can't
 visualize how do you think about that

0:10:45
Speaker 0 :difference well probably I'm not a very
 geometric person so I'm probably thinking in three dimensions and thebeauty of linear algebra is that is that
 it goes on to ten dimensions with no problem I mean that if you're justseeing what happens if you add two
 vectors in 3d you then you can add them in ten D or you're just adding the tencomponents so so I I can't say that I
 have a picture but yet I try to push the class to think of a flat surface in tendimensions so a plane in ten dimensions
 and so that's one of the spaces take all the columns of the matrix take all theircombinations so on so much of this
 column so much of this one then if you put all those together you get some kindof a flat surface that I call a vector
 space space of vectors and and my imagination is just seeing like a pieceof paper in 3d but anyway so that's one
 of the spaces that's space number one the column space of the matrix and thenthere's the row space which is as I said
 different but came came from the same numbers so we got the column space allcombinations of the columns and then
 we've got the row space all combinations of the rows so those are those words areeasy for me to say and I can't really
 draw them on a blackboard but I try with my thick chalk everybody everybody likesthat railroad chalk and me too
 I wouldn't use anything else now and and then the other two spaces areperpendicular to those so like if you
 have a plane in 3d just a plane is just a flat surface in 3d then perpendicularto that plane would be a line so that
 would be the null space so we've got two we've got a column space a row space andthey're two perpendicular spaces so
 those four fit together in the in a beautiful picture of a matrix yeah yeahit's sort of a fundamental it's not a
 difficult idea comes comes pretty early

0:13:10
Speaker 1 :in 1806 and it's basic planes in these
 multi-dimensional spaces how how difficult of an idea is that to come todo you think if you if you look back in
 time yeah I think mathematically it makes sense but I don't know if it'sintuitive for us to imagine just what
 we're talking about feels like calculus is easier to I see

0:13:34
Speaker 0 :into it well calculus I have to admit
 calculus came earlier earlier than linear algebra so Newton and Leibnizwere the great men to understand the key
 ideas of calculus but linear algebra to me is like okay it's the starting pointbecause it's all about flat things
 calculus has got all the complications of calculus come from the curves thebending this is a curved surfaces linear
 algebra the surfaces are all flat nothing bends in linear algebra so itshould have come first but it didn't and
 calculus also comes first in in high school classes in in college class it'llbe freshman math I'll be calculus and
 then I say enough of it like okay get to get to the good stuff and that you think

0:14:28
Speaker 1 :linear algebra should come first


0:14:30
Speaker 0 :well it really yeah I'm okay with it not
 coming first but it should yeah it should it's simpler because

0:14:38
Speaker 1 :everything is flat yeah everything's


0:14:40
Speaker 0 :flat of course for that reason you
 sort of sticks to one dimension or so or eventually you do multivariate but thatbasically means two dimensions linear
 algebra you take off into ten dimensions no problem it just feels scary and

0:14:55
Speaker 1 :dangerous to go beyond two dimensions


0:14:59
Speaker 0 :that's all if everything is flat you
 can't go wrong

0:15:03
Speaker 1 :so what concept or theorem in linear
 algebra or in math you find most beautiful it gives you pause that leaves

0:15:14
Speaker 0 :you and oh well I'll stick with linear
 algebra here I hope that viewer knows that really mathematics is amazingamazing subject and deep deep
 connections between ideas that didn't look connected some they turned out theywere but if we stick with linear algebra
 so we have a matrix that's like the basic thing a rectangle of numbers andmight be a rectangle of data you're
 probably going to ask me later about data science where and often data comesin a matrix you have you know maybe
 every column corresponds to a to a drug in every row corresponds to a patientand and if the patient reacted favorably
 to the drug then you put up some positive number in there anywayrectangle of numbers a matrix is basic
 so the big problem is to understand all those numbers you got a big big set ofnumbers and what are the patterns what's
 going on and so one of the ways to break down that matrix into simple pieces isuses something called singular values
 and that's come on as fundamental in the last and certainly in my lifetime I canvalues bro you if you have viewers
 who've done engineering math or or more basic linear algebra eigenvalues were inthere
 but those are restricted to square matrices and data comes in rectangularmatrices so you got to take that you got
 to take that next step I'm I'm always pushing math faculty get on do it don'tdo it
 do it singular values so those are a way to break to make to find these theimportant pieces of the matrix which add
 up to the whole matrix so so you're breaking a matrix into simple pieces andthe first piece is the most important
 part of the data the second piece is the second most important part and thenoften so a data scientist will like if
 if a data scientist can find those first and second pieces stop there the rest ofof the data is probably round off you
 know we're yeah experimental error maybe so you're looking for the important part

0:17:59
Speaker 1 :yeah so what do you find beautiful about


0:18:02
Speaker 0 :singular values well yeah I didn't give
 the theorem so here's the here's the idea of singular values every matrixevery matrix rectangular square whatever
 you can be written as a product of three very simple special matrices so that'sthe theorem every matrix can be written
 as a rotation times a stretch which is just a matrix diagonal matrix otherwiseall zeros except on the one diagonal and
 then a third and the third factor is another rotation so rotation stretchrotation is the breakup of a of any


0:18:45
Speaker 1 :matrix the structure that the ability
 that you can do that what do you find appealing what do you find beautiful

0:18:50
Speaker 0 :bodies well geometrically as I freely
 admit the mate action of a matrix it's not so easy to visualize but everybodycan visualize a rotation take-take-take
 two-dimensional space and just turn it around the around the centertake three-dimensional space so a pilot
 has to know about well what are the three the yaw is one of them I'veforgotten all the three turns that a
 pilot makes up to ten dimensions you've got ten ways to turn but you canvisualize a rotation take the space and
 turn it and you can visualize a stretch so to break a a matrix with all thosenumbers in it into something you can
 visualize rotate stretch rotate it's pretty neat pretty neat that's pretty

0:19:45
Speaker 1 :powerful on YouTube just consuming a
 bunch of videos and just watching what people connect with and what they reallyenjoy and are inspired by math seems to
 come up again and again I I'm trying to understand why that is perhaps you canhelp yeah I mean give me clues so it's
 not just to let the kinds of lectures that you give but it's also just otherfolks were like with numberphile there's
 a channel where they just chat about things that are extremely complicatedactually
 yeah people nevertheless connect with them you know what do you think that is

0:20:23
Speaker 0 :what it's wonderful isn't it I mean I
 wasn't really aware of it do so we're we're conditioned to think math is hardmath is abstract math is just for a few
 people but it isn't that way a lot of people quite like math and they liked itI get messages from people saying you
 know now I'm retired I'm gonna learn some more math I get a lot of those it'sreally encouraging and I think what
 people like is that there's some order you know a lot of order and or you knowthings are not obvious but they're true
 so it's really cheering to think that that so many people really want to learn

0:21:08
Speaker 1 :more about math yeah in terms of truth
 again sorry to slide into philosophy at times yeah math does reveal prettystrongly what things are true
 yeah I mean it's the whole point of

0:21:23
Speaker 0 :

0:21:24
Speaker 1 :proving things is and yet sort of our
 real world is messy and complicated what do you think about the nature of truththat math reveals oh wow because it is a
 source of comfort like you've mentioned yeah that's right

0:21:38
Speaker 0 :well I have to say I'm not much of a
 philosopher I just like numbers you know I think yeah I would you this was beforeyou had you had to go in when you're in
 the other filling your teeth yeah I kind of just take it yeah so I what I did wasthink about math you know like take
 powers of 2 2 4 8 16 up until the time the two stopped hurting and the dentistsaid you're through or Counting yeah so


0:22:11
Speaker 1 :so that was the source of just such a
 piece almost yeah what what what what is it about math you think that brings that

0:22:20
Speaker 0 :yeah what is that well you know where
 you are yeah symmetry it's it's certainty the fact that you know ifyou'd to if you multiply 2 by itself 10
 times you get a thousand 24 period that's everybody's gonna get that do you

0:22:34
Speaker 1 :see math is a powerful tool or is an art


0:22:38
Speaker 0 :form so it's both that's that's really
 one of the neat things you can you can be an artist and and like math you canbe a engineer and use math which are you


0:22:50
Speaker 1 :which am I what did you connect with


0:22:55
Speaker 0 :most yeah I'm in here between I'm
 certainly not a artist type philosopher type person might sound that way thismorning but I'm not yeah I I really
 enjoy teaching engineers because they they they go for an answer and yeah soof probably within the mountain MIT math
 department most people enjoy teaching people teaching students who get theabstract idea I'm okay with with I'm
 good with engineers who are looking for a way to find answers

0:23:35
Speaker 1 :yeah actually that's a interesting
 question do you think do you think for teaching and in general but thinkingabout new concepts do you think it's
 better to plug in the numbers or to think more abstractly so looking attheorems and proving the theorems or
 actually you know building up a basically tuition of the theorem or themethod the approach and then just
 plugging in numbers and seeing it work

0:24:02
Speaker 0 :you know well certainly many of us like
 to see examples first we understand it might be a pretty abstract soundingexample like a three dimensional
 rotation how are you gonna how are you gonna understand a rotation in 3d or in10 D or but and then some of us like to
 keep going with it to the point where you got numbers where you got 10 angles10 axes 10 angles but the best the great
 mathematicians is probably I don't know if they do that because they they forthem for them an example would be a
 highly abstract thing to the rest of it

0:24:54
Speaker 1 :right but nevertheless working within


0:24:57
Speaker 0 :the space of examples yeah example it
 seems to examples of structure our brain

0:25:01
Speaker 1 :

0:25:03
Speaker 0 :seemed to connect with that yeah yeah so


0:25:04
Speaker 1 :uh I'm not sure if you're familiar with
 him but Andrew yang is the presidential candidate currently running yeah withthe math in all capital letters and his
 hats as a slogan Isis stands for make

0:25:21
Speaker 0 :America think hard okay I'll vote for it


0:25:24
Speaker 1 :so and his name rhymes with yours yang
 strang so but he also loves math and then he comes from that world but healso looking at it makes me realize that
 math science and engineering are not really part of our politics rightpolitical discourse about political a
 government in general yeah what do you thinkthat is well what are your thoughts on


0:25:51
Speaker 0 :that in general well certainly somewhere
 in this system we need people who are comfortable with numbers comfortablewith quantities you know if you if you
 say this leads to that they see it it's

0:26:05
Speaker 1 :undeniable but isn't it strange to you
 that we have almost no I mean I'm pretty sure we have no elected officials inCongress or obviously the president yeah
 that is either it has an engineering

0:26:21
Speaker 0 :degree or a mess yeah well that's too
 bad you know a few could a few who could make the connection yeah it would haveto be people who are at the door who
 understand engineering or science and at the same time can make speeches and and

0:26:44
Speaker 1 :lead yeah inspire people yeah yeah you
 were speaking of inspiration the president of the Society for industrialapplied mathematics oh yeah as a major
 organization in math and Padma what do you see as a role of that society youknow in our public discourse right yeah


0:27:03
Speaker 0 :so well it was fun to be president at
 the at the time of years year two years around around 2000 his hope as presidentof a pretty small society but
 nevertheless it was a time when math was getting some more attention inWashington but yeah I got to give a
 little 10 minutes to into committee of the House of Representativestalking about why mint and then actually
 it was fun because one of the members of the house he had been a student had beenin my class what do you think of that
 yeah as you say a pretty rare most most members of the House have had adifferent training different background
 but there was one from New Hampshire who who was my friend really bye-bye beingin the class
 yeah so that those years were good then of course other things take take overand importance in Washington and maths
 math just at this point is not so visible but for a little moment it was

0:28:20
Speaker 1 :there's some excitement some concern
 about artificial intelligence in Washington now yes about the future yeahand I think at the core of that is math


0:28:29
Speaker 0 :well it is yeah yeah but maybe it's


0:28:32
Speaker 1 :hidden maybe he's wearing a different


0:28:34
Speaker 0 :hat but uh well artificial intelligence
 and and particularly can I use the words deep learning it's a deep learning is aparticular approach to understanding
 data again you've got a big a whole lot of data where data is just swapping thecomputers of the world and and - and
 understand it out of all those numbers to find what's important you know inclimate in everything and artificial
 intelligence is two words for for one approach to data deep learning is aspecific approach there which uses a lot
 of linear algebra so I got into it I thought okay I've got to learn about

0:29:21
Speaker 1 :this so maybe from your perspective and
 I asked the this most basic question yeah how do you think of a neuralnetwork what is it and you're on the 1


0:29:31
Speaker 0 :yeah ok so can I start with a idea about
 deep learning what does that mean sure what is deep learning what is deeplearning yeah so so we're trying to
 learn from all this day that we're trying to learn what's important whatwas some What's it telling us so you've
 you've got data you've got some inputs for which you know the right outputs thequestion is can you see the pattern
 there can you figure out a way for a new input which we haven't seen to to getthe to understand what the output will
 be from that new input so we've got a million inputs with their outso we're trying to create some patterns
 some rule that'll take those inputs those million training inputs which weknow about to the correct million
 outputs and this idea of a neural net is part of the structure of the of our newway to create a create a rule we're
 looking for a rule that will take these training inputs to the known outputs andthen we're going to use that rule on new
 inputs that we don't know the output and see what comes the linear algebra is a

0:30:56
Speaker 1 :big part of defining a finding that rule


0:30:59
Speaker 0 :that's right linear algebra is a big
 part not all the part people were leaning on matrices that's good still dolinear is something special
 it's all about straight lines and flat planes and and and data isn't quite likethat you know it's it's more complicated
 so you got to introduce some complication so you have to have somefunction that's not a straight line and
 it not only doubt it on linear nonlinear nonlinear and it turned out that the itwas enough to use the function that's
 one straight line and then a different one halfway that's so piecewise then hesaid one piece has one slope one piece
 the other piece has the second slope and so that introduced getting thatnonlinear simple non-linearity in blue
 the problem open that little piece makes

0:31:57
Speaker 1 :it sufficiently complicated to make


0:32:00
Speaker 0 :things interesting because you're gonna
 use that piece over and over a million times so you so you it has a it has afold in the in the graph the graph two
 pieces and but when you fold something amillion times you've got you've got a
 pretty complicated function that's pretty realistic so that's the thing

0:32:19
Speaker 1 :about neural networks is they have a lot
 of these a lot of these that's so why do you think neural networksby using a sort of formulating an
 objective function very not a plane yeah function holds lots of folds of theinputs the outputs why do you think they
 work to be able to find a rule that we don't know is optimal but it just seemsto be pretty good in a lot of cases
 what's your intuition is it surprising to you as it is to many people you havean intuition of why this works at all


0:33:00
Speaker 0 :well I'm beginning to have a better
 intuition this idea of things that are piecewise linear flat pieces but butwith folds between them like think of a
 roof of a complicated infinitely complicated house or something thatcurved it almost curved but every piece
 is flat that that's been used by engineers that ideas been used byengineers is used by engineers big time
 something called the finite element method if you want to if you want todesign a bridge design a building design
 airplane you're using this idea of piecewise flat as a good simplecomputable approximation to pay your you


0:33:51
Speaker 1 :have a sense that that there's a lot of
 expressive power in this kind of piecewise linear yeah well that's

0:33:59
Speaker 0 :combined together you use the right word
 if you measure the expressivity how how many how complicated a thing can canthis piecewise flat guys express the
 answer is very complicated yeah what do

0:34:15
Speaker 1 :you think are the limits of such
 piecewise linear or just neural networks its passivity of nool nose well you

0:34:24
Speaker 0 :would have said a while ago that they're
 just computational limits it you you know you the problem beyond a certainsize a supercomputer isn't going to do
 it but that does keep getting more powerful so that's that limit has beenmoved to allow more and more complicated


0:34:48
Speaker 1 :surfaces so in terms of just mapping
 from inputs to the outputs looking at data yeah what do you think of you knowin a context in your networks in general
 data is just tensor vectors matrices tensors how do you think about learningfrom data what how much of our world can
 be expressed in this way how useful is this process is the I guess that'sanother way to asking what are the
 limits of this well that's a good

0:35:19
Speaker 0 :question yeah so I guess the whole idea
 of deep learning is that there's something there to learn if the data istotally random just produced by random
 number generators then the we're not going to find a useful rule becausethere isn't one so the extreme of having
 a rule is like knowing Newton's law you know if you hit a hit a ball and movesso that's where you had laws of physics
 Newton and and Einstein and other great great people have have found those lawsand laws of the the the distribution of
 oil in a underground thing I mean that so so engineers petroleum engineers andunderstand how how oil will sit in a in
 an underground basin so there were rules now now the the new idea of artificialintelligence is learn the rules instead
 of instead of figuring out the rules by with help from Newton or Einstein thecomputer is looking for the rules so
 that's another step but if there are no rules at all for that the computer couldfind if it's totally random data well
 you've got nothing you've got no science to discover it's the automated search

0:36:48
Speaker 1 :for the underlying rules yeah


0:36:52
Speaker 0 :search for the rules yeah
 exactly yeah there will be a lot of random parts a lot I'm not knockingrandom because the that's there the the
 the there's a lot of randomness built in but there's got to be some basic it's

0:37:09
Speaker 1 :almost always signature right in most


0:37:11
Speaker 0 :there's got to be some signal yeah if
 it's all noise then there's there's you're not gonna get it anywhere

0:37:17
Speaker 1 :well this world around us does seem to
 be this seem to always have a signal some kind yeah yeah they discovered

0:37:24
Speaker 0 :

0:37:25
Speaker 1 :right that's it so
 what excites you more the we just talked about a little bit of application whatexcites me more theory or the
 application of mathematics well for

0:37:38
Speaker 0 :myself I'm probably a theory person I'm
 not I'm speaking here pretty freely about applications but I'm not a personwho really I'm not a physicist or a
 chemist or a neuroscientist so for myself I like this structure and thisflat subspaces and and and the relation
 of matrices columns to rows that's my part in the spectrum so the reallyscience is a big spectrum of people from
 asking practical practical questions and answering them using some math than somemath guys like myself or in the middle
 of it and then the geniuses of math and physics and chemistry and who arefinding fundamental rules and doing
 doing really understanding nature that's

0:38:51
Speaker 1 :at its lowest simplest level maybe just
 a quick in broad strokes from your perspective what is uh where does thelinear algebra sit as a subfield of
 mathematics what what are the various subfields a year okay a you think aboutin relation to linear algebra so the big


0:39:12
Speaker 0 :fields of math or algebra as a whole and
 problems like calculus and differential equations so that's a second quitedifferent field then maybe geometry
 deserves to be under sort of as a different field to understand thegeometry of high dimensional surfaces
 so I think am I allowed to say this here I think this is where personal viewcomes and I think math for thinking
 about undergraduate math what millions of students study I think we overdo thecalculus at at the cost of the algebra
 at the cost of linear dog titled

0:40:03
Speaker 1 :calculus versus linear that's right and
 and you say that linear algebra wins so you can you want can you dig into that alittle bit
 why does linear algebra win right well

0:40:16
Speaker 0 :ok I'm the viewer is gonna think this
 guy is biased not true I'm just telling the truth as it is yeah so I feel linearalgebra is just a nice part of math that
 people can get the idea of they can understand something it's a little bitabstract because once you get to ten or
 a hundred dimensions and very very very useful that's what's happened in in mylifetime is the the the importance of
 data which does come in matrix form so it's really set up for algebra it's notset up for a differential equation and
 now let me fairly add probability they're ideas of probability andstatistics have become very very
 important i've also jumped forward so and that's not that's different fromlinear algebra quite different so now we
 really have three major areas to me calculus linear algebra of matrices andprobability statistics and they all
 deserve a important place and and calculus has traditionally had a had alion's share of the time and
 disproportionate share yes but thank you proportionate that's agood work


0:41:45
Speaker 1 :of the the love and attention from the
 excited young minds yeah

0:41:50
Speaker 0 :

0:41:52
Speaker 1 :I know it's hard to pick favorites but
 what is your favorite matrix what's my

0:41:57
Speaker 0 :favorite matrix okay so my favorite
 matrix is square I admit it's a square bunch of numbers and it has twos runningdown the main diagonal and on the next
 diagonal so think of top left to bottom right twos down down the middle of thematrix and minus ones just above those
 twos and minus ones just below those twos and otherwise all zeros so mostlyzeros just three nonzero diagonals
 coming down what is interesting about it well all the different ways it comes upyou see it in engineering you see it as
 analogous in calculus to second derivative so calculus learns abouttaking the derivative the figuring out
 how much how fast something's changing but second derivative now that's alsoimportant that's how fast the change is
 changing how fast the graph is bending how fast it's it's curving and myFeinstein showed that that's fundamental
 to understand space so second derivatives should have a bigger placein calculus second mice matrices which
 are like the linear algebra version of second derivatives are neat in in linearalgebra yeah
 just everything comes out right with

0:43:33
Speaker 1 :those guys beautiful what did you learn
 about the process of learning by having taught so many students math over theyears


0:43:43
Speaker 0 :whoo that is hard I'll have to admit
 here that I'm not I'm not really a good teacher because I don't get into theexam part the exams the part of my life
 that I don't like and grading them and giving the students a or B or whatever Ido it
 because it's I'm supposed to do it but but I tell the class at the beginning Idon't know if they believe me probably
 they don't I tell the class I'm here to teach you I'm here to teach you math andnot to grade you and but they're
 thinking okay this guy it's gonna you know when's he gonna kids he's gonnagive me an A - is he gonna give me a
 b-plus what what would have you learn

0:44:31
Speaker 1 :about the process of learning of


0:44:34
Speaker 0 :learning yeah well maybe to be elated to
 give you a legitimate answer about learning I should have paid moreattention to the assessment the
 evaluation part at the end but I like the teaching part at the start that'sthe sexy part to tell somebody for the
 first time about a matrix Wow but is

0:44:56
Speaker 1 :there are there moments so you are
 teaching a concept are there moments of learning that you just see in thestudents eyes you don't need to look at
 the grades yeah you see in their eyes that that you hooked them that you knowthat you connect with them in a way
 where you know what they fall in love with this yes beautiful world amazing

0:45:21
Speaker 0 :see that it's got some beauty it's yeah


0:45:23
Speaker 1 :or conversely yeah that they give up at
 that point is the opposite the darkest a the math I'm just not good at math and

0:45:33
Speaker 0 :alcohol yeah yeah maybe because of the
 approach in the past they were discouraged but don't be discouragedit's it's too good to miss yeah I well
 if I'm teaching a big class do I know when I think maybe I do sort of Imentioned at the very start the four
 fundamental subspaces and the structure of the fundamental theorem of linearalgebra the fundamental theorem of
 linear algebra that is the relation of those four subspaces those four spacesyeah so I think that I feel that the


0:46:17
Speaker 1 :class gets it when they want to see the
 what advice do you have to a student just starting their journey mathematicstoday how do they get started


0:46:27
Speaker 0 :Oh No yeah that's hard well I hope you
 have a teacher professor who is still enjoying what he's doing and what he'steaching they're still looking for new
 ways to teach and and to understand math because that's the pleasure to themoment when you see oh yeah that works


0:46:54
Speaker 1 :so it's s about the material you yeah
 you study it's more about the source of the teacher being full of passion yeah

0:47:04
Speaker 0 :more about the fun yeah there's a moment
 of of getting it but in terms of topics

0:47:10
Speaker 1 :

0:47:14
Speaker 0 :linear algebra well that's not my topic
 but oh there's beautiful things in geometry to understand what's wonderfulis that in the end there there's a
 pattern there there's their rules that that that are followed in biology as

0:47:37
Speaker 1 :there are in every field you describe
 imitation as as a hundred percent

0:47:44
Speaker 0 :wonderful except for the great stuff


0:47:45
Speaker 1 :yeah and the grades were great yeah when
 you look back at your life yeah what memories bring you the most joy and

0:47:55
Speaker 0 :pride well that's a good question I
 certainly feel good when I maybe I'm giving a class in in 1806 that's mit--'s linear algebra course that I
 started so sort of there's a good feeling that okay I started this coursea lot of students take it quite a few
 like it yeah so I'm I'm sort of happy when I feel I'm helping helping make aconnection between ideas and students
 between theory and the reader yeah it's I get a lot of very nice messages frompeople who've watched the videos and
 it's inspiring I just not maybe it's take this chance to say thank you

0:48:48
Speaker 1 :well there's millions of students who
 you've taught and I am grateful to be one of them so good birth thank you somuch has been an honor thank you for


0:48:58
Speaker 0 :talking to it was a pleasure thanks
