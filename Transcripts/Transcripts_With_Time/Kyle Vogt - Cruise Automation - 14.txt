Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 convoked he is the president and the CTO of Cruz Automation leading an effort tosolve one of the biggest robotics
 challenges of our time vehicle automation he's a co-founder of twosuccessful companies twitch and crews
 that have each sold for a billion dollars and he's a great example of theinnovative spirit that flourishes in
 Silicon Valley and now is facing an interesting and exciting challenge ofmatching that spirit with the mass
 production and the safety centric culture of a major automaker likeGeneral Motors this conversation is part
 of the MIT artificial general intelligence series and the artificialintelligence podcast if you enjoy it

0:00:52
Speaker 0 :conversation with Kyle vote


0:00:53
Speaker 1 :

0:00:55
Speaker 0 :grew up in Kansas right yeah and I just
 saw that picture you had you know there's them a little bit a little bit

0:01:00
Speaker 1 :worried about that yeah so in high
 school in Kansas City you joined Shawnee Mission North High School Robotics teamyeah now that wasn't your high school


0:01:08
Speaker 0 :that's right that was that was the only
 high school in the area that had a like a teacher who was willing to sponsor a

0:01:16
Speaker 1 :FIRST Robotics team I was gonna troll
 you a little bit jog your mess

0:01:19
Speaker 0 :trying to look super cool and intense
 because you know this was BattleBots it's a serious businessso we're standing there with a welded


0:01:29
Speaker 1 :steel frame and looking tough so go back
 there what is that jury to robotics well

0:01:33
Speaker 0 :I think I've been trying to figure this
 out for a while but I've always liked building things with Legos and when Iwas really really young I wanted the
 Legos I had motors and other things and then you know Lego Mindstorms came outand for the first time you could program
 Lego contraptions and I think things just sort of snowballed from that but Iremember seeing you know the battle bots
 TV show on Comedy Central and thinking that is the coolest thing in the world Iwant to be a part of that and not
 knowing a whole lot about how to build these 200-pound fighting robots so Isort of obsessively pored over the
 internet forums where all the creator's for battle bots would sort of hang outand talk about you know document their
 build progress and everything and I think I read I must have read like youknow tens of thousands of forum posts
 from from basically everything that was out there on what these people weredoing and eventually like sort of
 triangulated how to how to put some of these things together and and ended updoing battle bots which was you know I
 was like 13 or 14 which is pretty

0:02:35
Speaker 1 :awesome I'm not sure if the show is
 still running but the battle bots is there's not an artificial intelligencecomponent it's remotely controlled and
 yeah it's an almost like a mechanical generic challenge yeah I think thingsthat can be broken they're


0:02:49
Speaker 0 :radio-controlled so and I think that
 they allowed some limited form of autonomy but you know in a two-minutematch you're in and the way these things
 ran you're really doing yourself a disservice by trying to automate itversus just you know do the practical
 thing which is drive it yourself

0:03:04
Speaker 1 :the entertainment aspect just going on
 YouTube there's like and some of them wield an axe some of them I mean there'sthat fun so what drew you to that aspect
 it wasn't the mechanical engineering was it the dream to create like Frankensteinand sentient being I was just like the
 Lego you like tinkering with stuff I

0:03:23
Speaker 0 :mean that that was just building
 something I think the the idea of you know this this radio-controlled machinethat that can do various things if it
 has like a weapon or something was pretty interesting I agree it doesn'thave the same appeal as you know
 autonomous robots which I which I you know sort of gravitated towards later onbut it was definitely an engineering
 challenge because everything you did in in that competition was pushingcomponents to their limits so we would
 buy like these $40 DC motors that came out of a winch like on the front of apickup truck or something and we'd power
 the car with those and we'd run them at like double or triple their ratedvoltage so they immediately start
 overheating but for that 2-minute match you can get you know a significantincrease in the power output of those
 motors before they burn out and so you're doing the same thing for yourbattery packs all the materials in the
 system and I think there was something something intrinsically interestingabout just seeing like where things


0:04:19
Speaker 1 :break and did you all fly and see where
 they break did you take it to the testing point like how did you know twominutes or was there a reckless let's
 just go with it and see we weren't very

0:04:29
Speaker 0 :good at BattleBots we lost all of our
 matches that woody first round like the one I built first both of them werethese wedge-shaped robots because a
 wedge even though it's sort of boring to look at is extremely effective you drivetowards another robot and the front edge
 of it gets under him and then they sort of flip over kind of like a door stopperand the first one had a pneumatic
 polished stainless steel spike on the front that would shoot out about eightinches the purpose of which is what
 pretty pretty ineffective actually but it looks cool and was it helpful to liftno it was it was just to try to poke
 holes in the other robot and then the second time I did it which is thefollowing I think maybe 18 months later
 we had well a titanium axe with a with a hardened steel tip on it that waspowered by a hydraulic cylinder which we
 were activating with liquid co2 which was hadits own set of problems so great so


0:05:23
Speaker 1 :that's kind of on the hardware side I
 mean at a certain point there must have been born a fascination on the softwareside so what was the first piece of coal
 you've written go back there see what language was it what what was that was aEmacs vim was it a more respectable
 modern ID do you remember any of this

0:05:45
Speaker 0 :yeah well I remember I think maybe when
 I was in third or fourth grade school I was at elementary school had a bunch ofApple 2 computers and we'd play games on
 those and I remember every once in a while something mood would would crashit wouldn't start up correctly and it
 would dump you out to what I later learned was like sort of a commandprompt and my teacher would come over
 and type actually remember this to this day for some reason like PR number sixor PR pound six which is peripheral 6
 which is the disk drive which would fire up the disk and load the program and Ijust remember thinking wow she's like a
 hacker like teach me these these codes these error codes what I called him atthe time but she had no interest in that
 so it wasn't until I think about fifth grade that I had a school where youcould actually go on these Apple twos
 and learn to program and so it's all in basic you know where every line you knowthe line numbers are all number that
 every line is numbered and you have to like leave enough space between thenumbers so that if you want to tweak
 your code you go back and the first line was 10 and the second line is 20 now youhave to go back and insert and 15 and if
 you need to add code in front of that you know 11 or 12 and you hope you don'trun out of line numbers and have to redo
 the whole thing

0:06:51
Speaker 1 :there's go-to statements yeah go to and


0:06:52
Speaker 0 :it's very basic maybe it's a name but a
 lot of fun and that was like that was you know it's fun that's when you knowwhen your first program you see the
 magic of it it's like it just just like this world opens up with you knowendless possibilities for the things you
 could build or or accomplish with that

0:07:10
Speaker 1 :computer so you got the bug then so even
 starting with basic and then what C++ throughout what did you it was acomputer program in computer science


0:07:19
Speaker 0 :classes in high school not not where I
 went so it was a self-taught but I did a lot of programming the thing thatyou know sort of pushed me in the path
 of eventually working on self-driving cars is actually one of these reallylong trips driving from my house in
 Kansas to I think Las Vegas where we did the Battle Watts competition and I hadjust gotten my I think my learner's
 permit or early driver's permit and so I was driving this you know 10 hourstretch across western Kansas where it's
 just you're going straight on a highway and it is mind-numbing ly boring and Iremember thinking even then with my sort
 of mediocre programming background that this is something that a computer can doright let's take a picture of the road
 let's find the yellow lane markers and you know steer the wheel and you knowlater I've come to realize this had been
 done you know since since the 80s or the 70sor even earlier but I still wanted to do
 it and sort of immediately after that trip switched from sort of BattleBotswhich is more radio-controlled
 machines to thinking about building you know autonomous vehicles of some scalestart off with really small electric
 ones and then you know progress to what we're doing now so what was your view of

0:08:28
Speaker 1 :artificial intelligence at that point
 what did you think so this is uh before there's been ways in artificialintelligence right the the current wave
 with deep learning makes people believe that you can solve in a really rich deepway the computer vision perception
 problem but like in before the deep learning craze you know how do you thinkabout how would you even go about
 building a thing that perceives itself in the world local as itself in theworld moves around the world like when
 you were younger and yeah as what was

0:09:01
Speaker 0 :your thinking about it well prior to
 deep neural networks our convolutional neural as these modern techniques wehave or at least ones that are in use
 today it was all heuristic space and so like old-school image processing and Ithink extracting you know yellow lane
 markers out of an image of a road is one of the problems that lends itselfreasonably well to those heuristic based
 methods you know like just do a threshold on the color yellow and thentry to fit some lines to that using a
 Hough transform or something and then go from there

0:09:32
Speaker 1 :traffic like detection and then stop
 signs detection red yellow green and I

0:09:35
Speaker 0 :think you can you could I mean if you
 wanted to do a full I was just trying to makething that would stay in between the
 lanes on a highway but if you wanted to do the full the full you know set ofcapabilities needed for a driverless car
 I think you could and we done this at cruise you know in the very first daysyou can start off with a really simple
 you know human written heuristic just to get the scaffolding in place for yoursystem traffic light detection probably
 a really simple you know color threshold injustice system up and running beforeyou migrate to you know a deep learning
 based technique or something else and you know back in when I was doing thismy first one it was on Pentium 203 233
 megahertz computer in it and I I think I wrote the first version in basic whichis like an interpreted language it's
 extremely slow because that's the thing I knew at the time and so there was nono chance at all of using there was no
 computational power to do any sort of reasonable deep nets like you have todayso I don't know what kids these days are
 doing our kids these days you know at age 13 using neural networks in theirgarage I mean I also I get emails all


0:10:40
Speaker 1 :the time from you know like 11 12 year
 old saying I'm having you know I'm trying to follow this tensorflowtutorial and I'm having this problem
 and their general approach in the deep learning community is of extremeoptimism of as opposed to you mentioned
 like heuristics you can you can separate the autonomous driving problem intomodules and try to solve it sort of
 rigorously or you just do it end to end and most people just kind of love theidea that you know us humans do a tenth
 and we just perceive and act we should be able to use that do the same kind ofthing when you're on that's and that
 that kind of thinking you don't want to criticize that kind of thinking becauseeventually they will be right yeah and
 so it's exciting and especially when they're younger to explore that is areally exciting approach but yeah it's
 it's changed the the language the kind of stuff you turned green with it it'skind of exciting to see when they


0:11:40
Speaker 0 :seniors grow up yeah I can only imagine
 if you if your starting point is you know Python and tensorflow at age 13where you end up you know after 10 or 15
 years of that that's that's pretty cool

0:11:51
Speaker 1 :because of github because this
 they're tools for solving most of the major problems and artificialintelligence are within a few lines of
 code for most kids and that's incredible to think about also on theentrepreneurial side and and and at that
 point was there any thought about entrepreneurship before you came tocollege is sort of doing your building
 this into a thing that impacts the world

0:12:17
Speaker 0 :on the large scale yeah I've always
 wanted to start a company I think that's you know just a cool concept of creatingsomething and exchanging it for value or
 creating value I guess so in high school I was I was so trying to build like youknow a servo motor drivers little
 circuit boards and sell them online or other other things like that andcertainly knew at some point I wanted to
 do a startup but it wasn't really I'd say until college until I felt like Ihad the
 I guess the right combination of the environment the smart people around youand some free time and a lot of free
 time at MIT so you came to MIT as an

0:12:52
Speaker 1 :undergrad 2004 that's right and that's
 when the first DARPA Grand Challenge was happening yeah the the timing of that isbeautifully poetic so how did you get


0:13:04
Speaker 0 :yourself involved in that one originally
 there wasn't a official entry yeah faculty sponsored thing and so a bunchof undergrads myself included I started
 meeting and got together and tried to haggle together some sponsorships we gota vehicle donated a bunch of sensors and
 tried to put something together and so we had our team was probably mostlyfreshmen and sophomores you know which
 was not really a fair fair fight against maybe the you know postdoc andfaculty-led teams from other schools but
 we we got something up and running we had our vehicle drive by a wire and youknow very very basic control and things
 but on the day of the qualifying for pre qualifying round the one and onlysteering motor that we had purchased the
 thing that we had you know retrofitted to turn the steering wheel on the truckdied and so our vehicle was just dead in
 the water couldn't steer so we didn't

0:13:59
Speaker 1 :make it very far on the hardware side so
 was there a software component was there like how did your view of autonomousvehicles in terms of artificial
 intelligence evolve in this moment I mean you know like you said from the 80shas been autonomous vehicles but really
 that was the birth of the modern wave the the thing that captivated everyone'simagination that we can actually do this
 so what how were you captivated in that way so how did your view of autonomous

0:14:28
Speaker 0 :vehicles change at that point I'd say at
 that point in time it was it was a the curiosity as in like is this reallypossible and I think that was generally
 the spirit and the the purpose of that original DARPA Grand Challenge which wasto just get a whole bunch of really
 brilliant people exploring the space and pushing the limits and and I think liketo this day that DARPA challenge with
 its you know million dollar prize pool was probably one of the most effectiveyou know uses of taxpayer money dollar
 for dollar that I've seen you know because that that small sort ofinitiative that DARPA put put out sort
 of in my view was the catalyst or the tipping point for this this whole nextwave of autonomous vehicle development


0:15:16
Speaker 1 :so that was pretty cool so let me jump
 around a little bit on that point they also did the urban challenge where I wasin the city but it was very artificial
 and there's no pedestrians and there's very little human involvement except afew professional drivers yeah do you
 think there's room and then there was the Robotics Challenge with humanoidrobots right so in your now role is
 looking at this you're trying to solve one of the you know autonomous drivingone of the harder more difficult places
 of San Francisco is there a role for DARPA to step in to also kind of helpout they challenge with new ideas
 specifically a pedestrians and so on all these kinds of interesting things well I

0:15:55
Speaker 0 :haven't I haven't thought about it from
 that perspective is there anything DARPA could do today to further acceleratethings and I would say my instinct is
 that that's maybe not the highest and best use of their resources in timebecause like kick starting and spinning
 up the flywheel is I think what what they did in this case for a very verylittle money but today this has become
 this has become like commercially interesting to very large companies andthe amount of money going into it and
 the amount of people like going through your class and learning about thesethings and developing these skills is
 just you know orders of magnitude more than it was back then and so there'senough momentum and inertia and energy
 and investment dollars into this space right now that I don't I don't I thinkthey're I think they're they can just
 say mission accomplished and move on to the next area of technology that thatneeds help


0:16:46
Speaker 1 :so then stepping back to MIT you left on
 my teaching a junior year what was that

0:16:52
Speaker 0 :decision like as I said I always wanted
 to do a company in or start a company and this opportunity landed in my lapwhich was a couple guys from Yale we're
 starting a new company and I googled them and found that they had started acompany previously and sold it actually
 on eBay for about a quarter million bucks which was a pretty interestingstory but so I thought to myself these
 guys are you know rock star entrepreneurs they've done this beforethey must be driving around in Ferraris
 because they sold their company and you know I thought I could learn a lot fromthem so I teamed up with those guys and
 you know went out during went out to California during IIP which is my teasemonth off on one on one way ticket and
 basically never went back we were having so much fun we felt like we werebuilding something and creating
 something and it was going to be interesting that you know I was just allin and got completely hooked and that
 that business was justin.tv which is originally a reality show about a guynamed Justin
 which morphed into a live video streaming platform which then morphedinto what is twitch today so that was
 that was quite a an unexpected journey

0:18:04
Speaker 1 :so no regrets no looking back it was
 just an obvious I mean one-way ticket I mean if we justpause on that for a second


0:18:13
Speaker 0 :

0:18:14
Speaker 1 :there was no how did you know these were
 the right guys this is the right decision you didn't think it was justfollow the heart kind of thing well I


0:18:22
Speaker 0 :didn't know but you know just trying
 something for a month during IEP he seems pretty little risk right right andthen you know well maybe I'll take a
 semester off and my teas pretty flexible about that you can always go back rightand then after two or three cycles of
 that I eventually threw in the towel but you know I think it'sI guess in that case I felt like I could
 always hit the undo button if I had to

0:18:45
Speaker 1 :right but it never lasts from from when
 you look in retrospect I mean it seems like a brave decision that you know it'sdifficult it would be difficult for a


0:18:53
Speaker 0 :lot of people to make it wasn't as
 popular I'd say that the general you know flux of people out of MIT at thetime was mostly into you know financier
 consulting jobs in Boston or New York and very few people were going toCalifornia to start companies but today
 I'd say that's it's probably inverted which is just a sign of a sign of thetimes I guess yeah


0:19:16
Speaker 1 :so there's a story about midnight of
 March 18 2007 where whether we're TechCrunch I guess and I was just in TVearlier than was supposed to a few hours


0:19:27
Speaker 0 :

0:19:28
Speaker 1 :the site didn't work I don't know if any
 of this is true you can tell me and I you and one of the folks adjusted to eI'm a shear coated through the night can
 you take me through that experience so let me let me say a few nice things thatthe article I read quoted Justin Kahn
 said that you were known for mural coding through problems and being acreative quote creative genius so on


0:19:55
Speaker 0 :that night what was going through your


0:19:57
Speaker 1 :head or maybe I put another way how do
 you solve these problems what's your approach to solving these kinds ofproblems were the line between success
 and failure seems to be pretty thin

0:20:09
Speaker 0 :that's a good question well first of all
 that's that's a nice of Justin to say that I think you know I would have beenmaybe twenty-one years old then and not
 very experienced at programming but as with with everything in a start-upyou're sort of racing against the clock
 and so our plan was the second we had this live streaming camera backpack upand running where Justin could wear it
 and no matter where he went in a city it would be streaming live video and thisis even before the iPhones this is like
 hard to do back then we would launch and so we thought we were there and and thebackpack was working and then we sent
 out all the emails to launch the launch the company and do the press thing andthen you know we weren't quite actually
 there and then we thought oh well you know they're not going to announce ituntil maybe 10 a.m. the next morning and
 it's I don't know it's 5 p.m. now so how many hours do we have left what is thatlike you have 17 hours to go and and and
 that was that was gonna be fine was the

0:21:11
Speaker 1 :problem obvious did you understand what
 could possibly like how complicated was

0:21:15
Speaker 0 :the system at that point it was it was
 pretty messy so to get a live video feed that looked decent working from anywherein San Francisco I put together the
 system where we had like three or four cell phone data modems and they werelike we take the video stream and you
 know sort of spray it across these three or four modems and then try to catch allthe packets on the other side you know
 with unreliable cell phone networks

0:21:40
Speaker 1 :pretty low level networking yeah and and


0:21:41
Speaker 0 :putting his like you know sort of
 protocols on top of all that to reassemble and reorder the packets andhave time buffers and error correction
 and all that kind of stuff and the night before it was just staticky every oncein while the image would would go
 staticky and there would be this horrible like screeching audio noisebecause the audio was also corrupted and
 this would happen like every five to ten minutes or so and it was a really youknow off-putting to the viewers


0:22:08
Speaker 1 :how do you tackle that problem what was
 the just freaking out behind a computer there's the word are there other otherfolks working on this problem like we
 behind a whiteboard were you doing uh

0:22:20
Speaker 0 :yes a little hair coding it has a little
 only because there's four of us working on the company and only two peoplereally wrote code and Emmett wrote the
 website in the chat system and I wrote the software for this video streamingdevice and video server and so I you
 know it's my sole responsibility to figure that out yeah and I think I thinkit's those you know setting setting
 deadlines trying to move quickly and everything where you're in that momentof intense pressure that sometimes
 people do their best and most interesting work and so even though thatwas a terrible moment I look back on it
 fondly because that's like you know that's one of those character definingmoments I think


0:22:54
Speaker 1 :so in 2013 October you founded cruise
 automation yeah so progressing forward another exception successful company wasacquired by GM in 16 for 1 billion
 dollars but in October 2013 what was on your mind what was the plan how does oneseriously start to tackle one of the
 hardest robotics most important impact for robotics

0:23:24
Speaker 0 :problems of our age after going through
 twitch twitch was was and it is today pretty successful but the the work wasthe result was entertainment mostly like
 the the better the product was the more we would entertain people and then youknow make money on them ad revenues and
 other things and that was that was a good thing it felt felt good toentertain people but I figured like you
 know what is really the point of becoming a really good engineer anddeveloping these skills other than you
 know my own enjoyment and I realized I wanted something that scratched more ofan existential itch like something that
 that truly matters and so I basically made this list of requirements for a newif I was going to do another company and
 the one thing I knew in the back of my head that twitch took like eight yearsto become successful and so whatever I
 do I better be willing to commit you know at least ten years to something andwhen you think about things from that
 perspective you certainly I think raised the bar onweight you choose to work on so for me
 the three things where it had to be something where the technology itselfdetermines the success of the product
 like hard really juicy technology problems because that's what motivatesme and then it had to have a direct and
 positive impact on society in some way so an example would be like you knowhealthcare self-driving cars because
 they save lives other things where there's a clear connection to somehowimproving other people's lives and the
 last one is it had to be a big business because for the positive impact tomatter it's got to be a large scale
 scale yeah and I was thinking about that for a while and I made like I triedwriting a gmail clone and looked at some
 other ideas and then it just sort of light bulb went off like self-drivingcars like that was the most fun I had
 ever had in college working on that and like well what's the state of thetechnology has been ten years maybe
 maybe times have changed and maybe now is the time to make this work and Ipoked around and looked at the only
 other thing out there really at the time was the Google self-driving car projectand I thought surely there's a way to
 you know have an entrepreneur mindset and sort of solve the Minimum ViableProduct here and so I just took the
 plunge right then in there and said this this is something I know I can committen years to it's the probably the
 greatest applied AI problem of our generation it's right and if it worksit's going to be both a huge business
 and therefore like probably the most positive impact I can possibly have onthe world so after that light bulb went
 off I went all in on crews immediately and got to work did you have an idea how

0:25:45
Speaker 1 :to solve this problem which aspect of
 the problem to solve you know slow like what we just had Oliver for voyage hereslow-moving retirement communities urban
 driving highway driving did you have like did you have a vision of the cityof the future or you know the
 transportation is largely automated that kind of thing or was it sort of morefuzzy and gray area than that my


0:26:12
Speaker 0 :analysis of the situation is that Google
 is putting a lot it had been putting a lot of money into that project that alot more resources and so
 and they still hadn't cracked the fully driverless car you know this is 20 2013I guess so I thought what what can I do
 to sort of go from zero to you know significant scale so I can actuallysolve the real problem which is the
 driverless cars and I thought here's the strategy we'll start by doing a reallysimple problem or solving a really
 simple problem that creates value for people so eventually ended up decidingon automating highway driving which is
 relatively more straightforward as long as there's a backup driver there andI'll you know the go-to-market will be
 able retrofit people's cars and just sell these products directly and theidea was we'll take all the revenue and
 profits from that and use it to do the social reinvest that in research fordoing fully fabulous cars and that was
 the plan the only thing that really changed alongthe way between then and now is we never
 really launched the first product we had enough interest from investors in enoughof a signal that this was something that
 we should be working on that after about a year of working on the highwayautopilot we had it working you know on
 a prototype stage but we just completely abandoned that and said we're gonna goall in on driverless cars now is the
 time can't think of anything that's more exciting and if it works more impactfulso we're just gonna go for it the idea


0:27:41
Speaker 1 :of retrofit is kind of interesting yeah
 being able to it's how you achieve scale it's a really interesting idea is it'ssomething that's still in the in the
 back of your mind as a possibility not

0:27:52
Speaker 0 :at all I've come full circle on that one
 trying to build a retrofit product and I'll touch on some of the complexitiesof that and then also having been inside
 in OEM and seeing how things work and how a vehicle is developed and validatedwhen it comes to something that has
 safety critical implications like controlling the steering and the othercontrol inputs on your car it's pretty
 hard to get there with with a retrofit or if you did even if you did it itcreates a whole bunch of new
 complications around liability or how did you truly validate that or you knowsomething in the base vehicle fails and
 causes your system to fail whose fault is itor if the cars anti-lock brake systems
 or other things kick in or the software has been it's different in one versionof the car you retrofit versus another
 and you don't know because the manufacturer has updated it behind thescenes there's basically an infinite
 list of longtail issues that can get you and if you're dealing with a safetycritical product that's not really
 acceptable that's a really convincing

0:28:49
Speaker 1 :summary of why it's really challenging


0:28:53
Speaker 0 :but I didn't at the time so we tried it
 anyway but it's a pitch also at the time

0:28:56
Speaker 1 :it's a really strong one yes that's how
 you achieve scale and that's how you beat the current the the leader at thetime of Google or the only one in the


0:29:04
Speaker 0 :market the other big problem we ran into
 which is perhaps the biggest problem from a business model perspective is wehad kind of assumed that we'd we started
 with an Audi s4 as the vehicle we retrofitted with his highway drivingcapability and we had kind of assumed
 that if we just knock out like three make and models of vehicle that'll coverlike eighty percent of a San Francisco
 market doesn't everyone there drive I don't know a BMW or a Honda Civic or oneof these three cars and then we surveyed
 our users we found out that it's all over the place we would to get even adecent number of units sold we'd have to
 support like you know 20 or 50 different models and each one is a littlebutterfly that takes time and effort to
 maintain you know that retrofit integration and custom hardware and allthis so is it there's a tough business


0:29:49
Speaker 1 :so GM manufactures and sells over nine
 million cars a year and what you with crews are trying to do some of the mostcutting-edge innovation in terms of
 applying AI and so hot out of those you've talked about a little bit beforebut it's also just fascinating to me
 we'll work a lot of automakers you know the difference between the gap betweenDetroit and Silicon Valley
 let's say just to be sort of poetic about it I guess what how do you closethat gap how do you take GM into the
 future where a large part of the fleet would be autonomous perhaps I want to

0:30:24
Speaker 0 :start by acknowledging that that GM is
 made up of you know tens of thousands of really brilliant motivated people whowant to be a part of the future and so
 it's pretty fun to work within the attitude inside a car company like thatis you know embracing this this
 transformation and change rather than fearing it and Ithink that's a testament to the
 leadership at GM and that's flown all the way through to to everyone you talkto even the people in this in blue
 plants working on these cars so that's really great so that starting from thatposition makes a lot easier so then when
 the the people in San Francisco at Cruz interact with the people at GM at leastwe have this common set of values which
 is that we really want this stuff to work because we think it's important andwe think it's the future
 not to say you know those two cultures don't clash they absolutely do there'sdifferent different sort of value
 systems like in a car company the thing that gets you promoted and so the rewardsystem is following the processes
 delivering the the program on-time and on-budget so any sort of risk-taking isdiscouraged in many ways because if a
 program is late or if you shut down the plant for a day it's you know you cancount the millions of dollars that burn
 by pretty quickly whereas I think you know most Silicon Valley companies andcrews in the methodology we were
 employing especially around the time of the acquisition the reward structure isabout trying to solve these complex
 problems in any way shape or form or coming up with crazy ideas that you know90% of them won't work and and so so
 meshing that culture of sort of continuous improvement andexperimentation with one where
 everything needs to be you know rigorously defined upfront so that younever slip a deadline or miss a budget
 was a pretty big challenge and that we're over three years in now after theacquisition and I'd say like you know
 the investment we made in figuring out how to work together successfully andwho should do what and how we bridge the
 gaps between these very different systems and way of doing engineeringwork is now one of our greatest assets
 because I think we have this really powerful thing but for a while it wasboth both GM and crews were very steep
 on the learning curve yes I'm sure it

0:32:38
Speaker 1 :was very stressful it's really important
 work because that's that's how to revolutionize the transportation itreally to revolutionize any system you
 know you look at the healthcare system or you look at the legal system I havepeople like lawyers come up to me all
 the time like everything they're working on can easily be automated but thenthat's not a good feeling yeah that was


0:32:57
Speaker 0 :

0:32:58
Speaker 1 :it's not a good feeling but also there's
 no way to automate because the the the entire infrastructure is really you knowbased is older and it moves very slowly
 and so how do you close the gap between I haven't how can I replace of courselawyers don't wanna be replaced with an
 app but you could replace a lot of aspect when most of the data is still onpaper
 and so the same thing was with automotive I mean it's fundamentallysoftware so it's is basically hiring
 software engineers it's thinking a software world I mean I'm pretty surenobody in Silicon Valley's ever hit a
 deadline so and then it's probably true yeah and GSI is probably the oppositeyeah so that's that culture gap is
 really fascinating so you're optimistic about the future of that yeah I mean

0:33:45
Speaker 0 :from what I've seen it's impressive and
 I think like especially in Silicon Valley it's easy to write off buildingcars because you know people have been
 doing that for over a hundred years now in this country and so it seems likethat's a solved problem but that doesn't
 mean it's an easy problem and I think it would be easy to sort of overlook thatand think that you know we're Silicon
 Valley engineers we can solve any problem you know building a car it'sbeen done therefore it's you know it's
 it's it's not it's not a real engineering challenge but after havingseen just the sheer scale and magnitude
 and industrialization that occurs inside of an automotive assembly plant that isa lot of work that I am very glad that
 we don't have to reinvent to make self-driving cars work and so to haveyou know partners who have done that for
 a hundred years now these great processes and this huge infrastructureand supply base that we can tap into is
 just remarkable because the scope in surface area of the problem of deployingfleets of self-driving cars is so large
 that we're constantly looking for ways to do less so we can focus on the thingsthat really matter more and if we had to
 figure out how to build an assemble in you know test and build the carsthemselves I mean we work closely with
 Jim on that but if we had to develop all that capability in-house as well youknow that that would just make make the
 problem really intractable I think mmm

0:35:10
Speaker 1 :so yeah just like your first entry mit
 DARPA challenge when there was what the motor that failed and somebody thatknows what they're doing with the motor
 did it that would have been nice if you

0:35:20
Speaker 0 :focus on the software and not the
 hardware platform yeah right so from

0:35:25
Speaker 1 :your perspective now you know there's so
 many ways that autonomous vehicles can impact Society in the next year fiveyears ten years what do you think is the
 biggest opportunity to make money in autonomous driving sort of make it afinancially viable thing in the
 near-term what do you think would be the biggest impact there well the things

0:35:48
Speaker 0 :that that drive the economics for fleets
 of self-driving cars or they're sort of a handful of variables one is you knowthe cost to build the vehicle itself so
 the material cost how many you know what's the cost of all your sensors plusthe cost of the vehicle and every all
 the other components on it another one is the lifetime of the vehicle it's verydifferent if your vehicle drives one
 hundred thousand miles and then it falls apart versus you know two millionand then you know if you have a fleet
 it's kind of like an airplane where or airline where once you produce thevehicle you want it to be in operation
 as many hours a day as possible producing revenue and then a you knowthe other piece of that is how are you
 generating revenue I think that's kind what you're asking and I think theobvious things today are you know the
 ride-sharing business because that's pretty clear that there's demand forthat there's existing markets you can
 tap into and larger urban areas that

0:36:47
Speaker 1 :kind of thing yeah yeah and and and I


0:36:48
Speaker 0 :think that there are some real benefits
 to having cars without drivers compared to through the status quo for people whouse ride share services today you know
 you get privacy consistency hopefully significant improve safety allthese benefits versus the current
 product but it's it's a crowded market and then other opportunities whichyou've seen a lot of activity in the
 last really in last six to twelve months is you know delivery whether that'sparcels and packages food or or
 groceries those are all sort of I think opportunities that are that are prettyripe for these you know once you have
 this core technology which is the fleet of autonomous vehicles there's all sortsof different business opportunities you
 can build on top of that but I think the important thing of course is thatthere's zero monetization opportunity
 until you actually have that fleet of very capable driverless cars that arethat are as good or better than humans
 and that's sort of where the entire industry is sort of in this holdingpattern right now yeah the trend


0:37:47
Speaker 1 :achieved that baseline so but you said
 sort of rely not reliability consistency it's kind of interesting I think I heardyou say somewhere I'm not sure if that's
 what you meant but you know I can imagine a situation where you would getan autonomous vehicle and you know when
 you get into an uber or lyft you don't get to choose the driver in asense that you don't get to choose the
 personality of the driving do you think there's a there's room to define thepersonality of the car the way drives
 you in terms of aggressiveness for example in terms of sort of pushing thebomb the one of the biggest challenges
 in Toms driving is the is a trade-off between sort of safety andand do you think there's any room for
 the human to take a role in that decision to accept the liability I guess

0:38:37
Speaker 0 :we III wouldn't it no I'd say within
 reasonable bounds as in we're not gonna I think it'd be highly unlikely we didexpose any nob that would let you you
 know significantly increase safety risk I think that's that's just not somethingwe'd be willing to do but I think
 driving style or like you know are you gonna relax the comfort constraintsslightly or things like that all of
 those things make sense and are plausible I see all those is you knownice optimizations once again we get the
 core problem solved and these fleets out there but the other thing we've sort ofobserved is that you have this intuition
 that if you sort of slam your foot on the gas right after the light turnsgreen and aggressively accelerate you're
 gonna get there faster but the actual impact of doing that is pretty small youfeel like you're getting there faster
 but so that so the same would be true for ABS even if they don't slam thereyou know the pedal to the floor when the
 light turns green they're gonna get you they're within you know if it's a15-minute trip within 30 seconds of what
 you would have done otherwise if you were going really aggressively so Ithink there's this sort of
 self-deception that that my aggressive driving style is getting me there fasterwell so that's you know some of the


0:39:44
Speaker 1 :things I study some things I'm
 fascinated by the psychology of that I don't think it matters that it doesn'tget you there faster it's it's the
 emotional release driving is is a place being inside or a car somebody said it'slike the real world version of being a
 troll so you have this protection this mental protection you're able to sort ofyell at the world like release your
 anger whatever is but so there's an element of that that I think autonomousvehicles would also have to you know
 have giving an outlet to people but it doesn't have to be through throughthrough driving or honking or so on
 there might be other outlets but I think to just sort of even just put that asidethe baseline is really you know that's
 the focus that's the thing you need to solve and then the fun human things canbe solved after but so from the baseline
 of just solving autonomous driving and you're working in San Francisco one ofthe more difficult cities to operate in
 what what is what is the any of you currentlythe hardest aspect of autonomous driving
 and negotiated with pedestrians is that edge cases of perception is it planningis there a mechanical engineering is it
 data fleet stuff like what are your thoughtson the challenge the more challenging
 aspects there that's a good that's a

0:41:01
Speaker 0 :good question I think before before we
 go to that though I just wanted I like what you said about the psychologyaspect of this because I think one
 observation I made is I think I read somewhere that I think it's maybeAmericans on average spend you know over
 an hour a day on social media like staring at Facebook and so that's justyou know 60 minutes of your life you're
 not getting back and it's probably not super productive and so that's 3,600seconds right and that's that's time you
 know it's a lot of time you're giving up and if you compare that to people beingon the road if another vehicle whether
 it's a human driver or autonomous vehicle delays them by even threeseconds they're laying in on the horn
 you know even though that's that's you know one one thousandth of the time theywaste looking at Facebook every day so
 there's there's definitely some you know psychology aspects of this I think thatare pre interesting road rage in general
 and then the question of course is if everyone is in self-driving cars do theyeven notice these three-second delays
 anymore because they're doing other things or reading or working or justtalking to each other so it'll be
 interesting to see where that goes in a certain aspect people people need

0:42:04
Speaker 1 :to be distracted by something
 entertaining something useful inside the car so they don't pay attention to theexternal world and then and then and it
 can take whatever psychology and bring it back to Twitter and then focus onthat as opposed to sort of interacting
 sort of putting the emotion out there into the world so it's a it's aninteresting problem but baseline
 autonomy I guess you could say

0:42:27
Speaker 0 :self-driving cars you know at scale will
 lower the collective blood pressure of society probably by a couple points yeahwithout all that road rage and stress so
 that's a good good externality so back to your question about the technology inthe the I guess the biggest problems and
 I have a hard time answering that question because you know we've been atthis
 like specifically focusing on driverless cars and all the technology needed toenable that for a little over four and a
 half years now and even a year or two in I felt like we hadcompleted the functionality needed to
 get someone from point A to point B as in if we need to do a left turn maneuveror if we need to drive around a you know
 a double parked vehicle into oncoming trafficor navigate through construction zones
 the the scaffolding and the building blocks where it was there pretty earlyon and so the challenge is not any one
 scenario or situation for which you know we fail at 100% of those it's more youknow we're benchmarking against a pretty
 good or pretty high standard which is human driving all things consideredhumans are excellent at handling the
 edge cases and unexpected scenarios whereas computers the opposite and sobeating that that baseline set by humans
 is the challenge and so what we've been doing for quite some time now isbasically
 it's this continuous improvement process where we find sort of the the most youknow uncomfortable or the things that
 that could lead to a safety issue other things all these events and then we sortof categorize them and rework parts of
 our system to make incremental improvements and do that over and overand over again and we just see sort of
 the overall performance of the system you know actually increasing in a prettysteady clip but there's no one thing
 there's actually like thousands of little things and just like polishingfunctionality and making sure that it
 handles you know every version impossible permutation of a situation byeither applying more deep learning
 systems or just by you know adding more tests coverage or new scenarios thatthat we develop against and just
 grinding on that it's we're sort of in the the unsexy phase of developmentright now which is doing the real
 engineering work that it takes to go from prototype to productionyou're basically scaling the the


0:44:45
Speaker 1 :grinding so has sort of taking seriously
 that the process of all those edge cases both with human experts and machinelearning methods to cover to cover all
 those situations yeah and the exciting

0:44:59
Speaker 0 :thing for me is I don't think that
 grinding ever stops right because there's a moment in time where you youcross that threshold of human
 performance and become superhuman but there's no reason there's no firstprinciples reason that AV capability
 will tap out anywhere near humans like there's no reason it couldn't be 20times better whether that's you know
 just better driving or safer driving a more comfortable driving or even athousand times better given enough time
 and we intend to basically chase that you know forever to build the bestpossible product better and better and


0:45:33
Speaker 1 :better and always new educators come up
 and you experiences so and you want to automate that process as much aspossible mhm so what do you think in
 general in society when do you think we may have hundreds of thousands of fullyautonomous vehicles driving around so
 first of all predictions nobody knows the future you're a part of the leadingpeople trying to define that future but
 even then you still don't know but if you think about a hundreds of thousandsof heat
 so a significant fraction of vehicles in major cities are autonomous do you thinkI would Rodney Brooks who is 2050 and
 beyond are you more with Elon Musk who is we should have had that two years ago

0:46:20
Speaker 0 :well I mean I don't want me to have it
 two years ago but we're not there yet so I guess the the way I would think aboutthat is let's let's flip that question
 around so what would prevent you to reach hundreds of thousands of vehiclesand that's a goodness a good rephrasing


0:46:37
Speaker 1 :

0:46:38
Speaker 0 :yeah so the
 I'd say the it seems the consensus among thepeople developing self-driving cars
 today is to sort of start with some form of an easier environment whether itmeans you know lacking inclement weather
 or you know mostly sunny or whatever it is and then add add capability for morecomplex situations over time and so if
 you're only able to deploy in areas that that meet sort of your criteria or thatthe current domain you know operating
 domain of the software you developed that may put a cap on how many citiesyou could deploy in
 but then as those restrictions start to fall away like maybe you add you knowcapability to drive really well and and
 safely in heavy rain or snow you know that that probably opens up the marketby - two or three fold in terms of the
 cities you can expand into and so on and so the real question is you know I Iknow today if we wanted to we could
 produce that that many autonomous vehicles but we wouldn't be able to makeuse of all of them yet because we would
 sort of saturate the demand in the cities in which we would want to operateinitially so if I were to guess like
 what the timeline is for those things falling away and reaching hundreds ofthousands of vehicles maybe a range is
 but I would I would say less than five

0:47:58
Speaker 1 :years that's in five years yeah and of
 course you're working hard to make that happenso you started two companies that were
 eventually acquired for each for a billion dollars so you're pretty goodperson to ask what does it take to build
 a successful startup mmm-hmm I think

0:48:14
Speaker 0 :there's there sort of survivor bias here
 a little bit but I can try to find some common threads for the the things thatworked for me which is
 you know in in both of these companies it was really passionate about the coretechnology I actually like you know lay
 awake at night thinking about these problems and how to solve them and Ithink that's helpful because when you
 start a business there are like to this day they're they're these crazy ups anddowns like one day you think the
 business is just on you're just on top of the world and unstoppable and thenext day you think okay this is all
 gonna and you know it's it's just it's just going south and it's gonna be overtomorrow and and so I think like having
 a true passion that you can fall back on and knowing that you would be doing iteven if you weren't getting paid for it
 helps you whether those those tough times so that's one thing I think theother one is
 really good people so I've always been surrounded by really good co-foundersthat are logical thinkers are always
 pushing their limits and have very high levels of integrity so that's Dan Khanin my current company and actually his
 brother and a couple other guys for Justin TV and twitch and then I thinkthe last thing is
 just uh I guess persistence or perseverance like and and that that canapply to sticking to sort of a or having
 conviction around the original premise of your idea and and sticking around todo all the you know the unsexy work to
 actually make it come to fruition including dealing with you know whateverit is that that you're not passionate
 about whether that's finance or or HR or or operations or those things as long asyou are grinding away in working towards
 you know that North Star for your business whatever it is and you don'tgive up and you're making progress every
 day it seems like eventually you'll end up in a good place and the only thingsthat can slow you down are you know
 running out of money or I suppose your competitors destroying you but I thinkmost of the time it's people giving up
 or or somehow destroying things themselves rather than being beaten bytheir competition or running out of
 money yeah if you never quit eventually

0:50:12
Speaker 1 :you'll arrive


0:50:15
Speaker 0 :so working size version of what I was
 trying to say yeah so you want the Y

0:50:18
Speaker 1 :Combinator out twice yeah what do you
 think in a quick question do you think is the best way to raise funds in theearly days or not just funds but just
 community develop your idea and so on can you do it solo or maybe with aco-founder with like self-funded do you
 think Y Combinator is good it's good to do VC route is there no right answer wasthere for the Y Combinator experience
 something that you could take away that that was the right path to take there's

0:50:49
Speaker 0 :no one-size-fits-all answer but if your
 ambition I think is to you know see how big you can make something or or orrapidly expand and capture market or
 solve a problem or whatever it is then then you know going to venture backroute is probably a good approach so
 that so that capital doesn't become your primary constraint Y Combinator I lovebecause it puts you in this sort of
 competitive environment while you're where you're surrounded by you know thetop maybe one percent of other really
 highly motivated you know peers who are in the same same place and that thatenvironment I think just breeds
 breed success right if you're surrounded by really brilliant hard-working peopleyou're gonna feel you know sort of
 compelled or inspired to try to emulate them and/or beat them and so even thoughI had done it once before and I felt
 like yeah I'm pretty self-motivated I thought like I look this is gonna be ahard problem I can use all the help I
 can get so surrounding myself with other entrepreneurs is gonna make me work alittle bit harder or push a little
 harder than it's worth it when Saba white why I did it you know for examplea second time let's let's go


0:51:55
Speaker 1 :philosophical existential if you'd go
 back and do something differently in your life starting in high school thanMIT leaving MIT you could have gone the
 PG route doing startup I'm gonna see about a start-up in California and youthor maybe some aspects of fundraising is
 there something you'll regret something you need not necessarily grabbut if you go back it could do
 differently I think I've made a lot of

0:52:22
Speaker 0 :mistakes like you know pretty much
 everything you can screw up I think I've screwed up at least once but I you knowI don't regret those things I think it's
 hard to hard to look back on things even if they didn't go well and call it aregret because hopefully took away some
 new knowledge or learning from that so I would say there was a period yeah theclosest I can I can come to us is
 there's a period in in justin.tv I think after seven years wherethat the company was going one direction
 which is sorts twitch in video gaming and I'm not a video gamer I don't reallyeven use twitch at all and I was still
 working on the core technology there but my heart was no longer in it because thebusiness that we were creating was not
 something that I was personally passionate about it didn't meet your bar

0:53:11
Speaker 1 :of existential impact yeah and I'd say


0:53:13
Speaker 0 :III probably spent an extra year or two
 working on that and and I'd say like I would have just tried to do somethingdifferent sooner because those are those
 were two years where I felt like you know from this philosophical orexistential thing I I just I just felt
 something was missing and so I would have I would have if I could look backnow and tell myself it's like I would
 have said exactly that like you're not getting any meaning out of your workpersonally right now you should you
 should find a way to change that and that's part of the pitch I use tobasically everyone who joins crews today
 it's like hey you've got that now by coming herewell maybe you needed the two years of


0:53:49
Speaker 1 :that existential dread to develop the
 feeling that ultimately was the fire that created crews so you never know youcan be good theory yeah so last question
 what does 2019 hold for crews after this

0:54:02
Speaker 0 :I guess we're gonna go and I'll talk to
 your class but one of the big things is going from prototype to production forautonomous cars and what does that mean
 once that look like in 2019 for us is the year that we try to cross over thatthreshold and reach
 you know superhuman level of performance to some degree with the software andhave all the other of the thousands of
 little building blocks in place to launch you know our first commercialproduct so that's that's what's in score
 for us are in store for us and we've got a lot of work to do we've got a lot ofbrilliant people working on it so it's
 it's all up to us now yeah from Charlie

0:54:38
Speaker 1 :Miller and Chris fells like the people I
 have crossed paths with if you know it sounds like you have an amazing team soI'm like I said it's one of the most I
 think one of the most important problems in artificial intelligence of thecentury you'll be one of the most
 defining the super exciting that you work on it and the best of luck in 2019I'm really excited to see what Cruz
 comes up with thank you thanks for
