Speaker 0 :as part of MIT course success zero nine


Speaker 1 :nine on artificial general intelligence


Speaker 0 :I got a chance to sit down with
 Christophe Coe who's one of the seminal figures inneurobiology in neuroscience and
 generally in the study of consciousness he is the president the chief scientificofficer of the Allen Institute for brain
 science in Seattle from 1986 to 2013 he

Speaker 1 :was the professor at Caltech before that


Speaker 0 :he was at MIT he is extremely well sited
 over a hundred thousand citations his research his writing his ideas have hadbig impact on the scientific community
 and the general public in the way we think about consciousness in the way wesee ourselves as human beings he's the
 author of several books the quest for consciousness and your biologicalapproach and a more recent book
 consciousness confessions of a romantic reductionist if you enjoy this

Speaker 1 :conversation this course subscribe click


Speaker 0 :the little bell I got to make sure you
 never miss a video and in the comments leave suggestions for any people you'dlike to see be part of the course or any
 ideas that you would like us to explore

Speaker 1 :thanks very much I hope you enjoy okay
 before we delve into the beautiful mysteries of consciousness let's zoomout a little bit and let me ask do you
 think there's intelligent life out there

Speaker 0 :in the universe yes I do believe so we
 have no evidence of it but I think the probabilities are overwhelming in favorof it
 give me a universe where we have 10 to the 11 galaxies and each galaxy isbetween 10 to the 11 10 to the 12 stars
 and we know more stars have one or more

Speaker 1 :planets so how does that make you feel


Speaker 0 :it still makes me feel special because I
 have experiences I feel the world I experience the world and independent ofwhether there are other creatures out
 there I still feel the world and I have access to this world in this verystrange compelling way and that's the
 core of human existence now he said

Speaker 1 :human do you think if those intelligent
 creatures are out there do you think they experiencetheir world yes they evolved if they are


Speaker 0 :product of natural evolution if it would
 have to be they will also experience their own world so consciousness isn'tjust a human your ID it's it's much
 wider it's probably it may be spread across all of biology we have the onlything that we have special is we can
 talk about it of course not all people can talk about the babies and littlechildren can talk about the patients who
 have have a Stoke and let's see the left inferior frontal gyrus can talk about itbut most normal adult people can talk
 about it and so we think that makes us special compared to little monkeys adogs or cats or mice or all the other
 creatures that we share the planet with but all the evidence seems to suggestthat they to experience the world and so
 it's overwhelmingly likely that other alien that aliens would also experiencetheir world of course differently
 because they have a difference in serum they've different sense of they had avery different environment but the fact
 that I would strongly suppose that they also have experiences if your pain andpleasure and see in some sort of
 spectrum and here and have all the other

Speaker 1 :sensors of course their language if they
 have one would be different so we might not be able to understand their poetryabout the experiences that they have
 that's correct right so in a talk in a video I've heard you mention support soa DAC sound that you came up with
 there you go up with as part of your family when you were young first of allyou're a technically a Midwestern boy


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you just secondly yes after that you
 traveled around a bit and it's a little bit of the accent you talked aboutsupport so the DAC solid having these
 elements of humaneness of consciousness that he discovered so I just wanted toask can you look back and you childhood
 and remember one was the first time you realized you yourself sort of from athird-person perspective or our
 conscious being this idea of you know stepping outside yourself and seeingwell there's something special going on


Speaker 0 :here in my brain I can't really actually
 it's a good question I'm not sure I recall a discrete moment I mean you takeit for granted because that's the only
 world you know at the only world I know you know it's aworld of seeing and hearing voices and
 touching and all the other things so it's only much later at early in myundergrad days when I became when I
 enrolled in physics and in philosophy that I really thought about it andthought well this is really
 fundamentally very very mysterious and there's nothing really in physics rightnow that explains his transition from
 the physics of the brain to feelings where do the feelings come in all rightso you can look at the foundational
 equation of quantum mechanics general relativity you can look at the periodtable of the elements you can look at
 the endless 80g seat chat and our genes and no way is consciousness yet I wakeup every morning to a world where I have
 experiences and so that's the hub of the ancient mind-body problem how doexperiences get into the world so what


Speaker 1 :is consciousness experience


Speaker 0 :consciousness is any any conte any
 experience some people call it subjective feeling some people call itphenomenon phenomenology some people
 call it quality of their philosophy all denote the same thing it feels likesomething in the famous word of as if a
 loss at Thomas Nagel it feels like something to be a bad or to be a youknow an American out to be angry or to
 be sad or to be in love or to have pain and that is what experience is anypossible experience could be as mundane
 as just sitting in a chair could be as exalted as you know having a mysticalmoment you know in in deep meditation
 those are just different forms of

Speaker 1 :experiences experience so if you were to
 sit down with maybe the next skip a couple generations of IBM Watsonsomething that one jeopardy
 what is the gap I guess the question is between Watson that might be much moresmarter than you then ask then all any
 human alive but may not have experience

Speaker 0 :what is the gap well so that's a big big
 question that's occupied people for the last certainly last 50 years since weyou know since he happened the birth of
 of computers that's a question on chilling try to answer and of course hedid it in this indirect way by proposing
 its test and operational test so but that's not really that's you know hetried to get it what does it mean for
 person to think and then he had this test like you lock him away and then youhave a communication with him and then
 you try to to guess after while whether that is a person or whether it's acomputer system there's no question that
 now or very soon you know Alexa or Siri or you knowGoogle now will pass this test right and
 you can game it but you know ultimately certainly in your generationthere will be machines that will speak
 with complete poise that will remember everything you ever said they'llremember every email you ever had like
 like Samantha remember in the movie her yeah it's no question it's gonna happenbut of course the key questions is does
 it feel like anything to be Samantha in a movie home too does it feel likeanything to be Watson and there one has
 to be very very strongly think they're two different concepts here that we callmingle there is the concept of
 intelligence natural or artificial and there is a concept of consciousness ofexperience natural or artificial those
 are very very different things now historically we associate consciousnesswith intelligence why because we live in
 a world leaving aside computers of naturalselection where we are surrounded by
 creatures either our own kin that are less or more intelligent or we go acrossspecies some some are more adapted to
 particular environment others are less a tablet whether it's a whale or dog oryou go talk about a Paramecium or a
 little worm alright and and we see the complexity of the nervous system goesfrom one cell to two specialized cells
 to a worm that has three net that has 30% of its cells and nerve cells tocreature like also like a blue whale
 that ever has had a billion even more nerve cells and so they based onbehavioral evidence and based on the
 underlying neuroscience we believe that as these creatures become more complexthey are better adapted to it to their
 particular ecological niche and they become more conscious probably becausetheir brain calls and we believe
 consciousness unlike the ancient ancient people thought most almost every cultthought that consciousness with
 intelligence has to do with your heart mm-hmm and you still to see that todayyou see honey I love you is on my house
 yes but what you should actually say no honey I love you was all my lateralhypothalamus and for Valentine's Day you
 should give you a sweetheart you know hypothalamic same piece ofchocolate another heart shaped chocolate
 right and you know so we still have this language but now we believe it's a brainand so we see brains of different
 complexity and we think well they have different levels of consciousnessthey're capable of different experiences
 [Music] but now we confront a world where weknow where we're beginning to engineer
 intelligence and it's radical unclear whether the intelligence we'reengineering has anything to do with
 consciousness and whether it can experience anything becausefundamentally what's the difference
 intelligence is about function intelligence no matter exactly how youdefine it sort of an adaptation to new
 environments being able to learn and quickly understand you know you know thesetup of this and what's going on and
 who the actors and what's gonna happen nextgets all about function consciousness is
 not about function consciousness is about being it's in some sense muchfundamental you can see folks that you
 can see this in two in several cases you can see it for instance in the case ofthe clinic when you're dealing with
 patients who are let's say had a stroke or had were in traffic accident etcthey're pretty much in mobile Terri
 Schiavo you may have heard historically she was a person here in the in the 90sin flora - heart Stood Still she was
 reanimated and for the next fourteen years she was what's called in avegetative state so there are thousands
 of people in a vegetative state so they're you know they're you knowthey're like this occasionally they open
 their eyes for two three four five six eight hours and then close their eyesthey have sleep-wake cycle occasionally
 they have behavior they do you know there but there's no way that you canestablish a lawful relationship between
 what you see or the doctor says or the mom says and what the patient doescorrectly so so the so the there isn't
 any behavior yet in some of these people there is still experience you can youcan
 design and build brain machine interfaces where you can see there'sthey still explain something and of
 course at these cases of locked-in state there's a famous book called that thediving bell and the butterfly well yet
 an editor French editor here the stroke in the in the brainstem unable to moveexcept his vertical eyes eye movement he
 could just move his the eyes up and down and he dictated an entire book and somepeople even lose this at the end it all
 the evidence seems to suggest that they're still in there in this case youhave no behavior your consciousness
 second cases tonight like all of us you're gonna go to sleep close your eyesyou go to sleep you will wake up inside
 your sleeping body and you will have conscious experiences they are differentfrom everyday experience you might fly
 you might not be surprised that you're flying you might meet a long-dead petchildhood dog and you're not surprised
 that you're meeting them you know but you have conscious experience of love ofhate you know they can be very emotional
 your body during this stage typically to them state sends an active signal toyour motor neurons to paralyze you it's
 called atonia right because if you don't have that like some patience what do youdo you act out your dreams you get
 proximal and behavioral disorder which is a bad which is bad juju to get okaythird case is pure experience so I
 recently had this what some people call a mystical experience I went toSingapore and went into a flotation tank
 yeah alright so this is a big tub filled was ever with water that's a bodytemperature and Epsom salt you still
 completely naked you lie inside of it you close the layer Ignace completedarkness soundproof so very quickly you
 become body less because you're floating and you're naked you have no rings nowatch no nothing you don't feel your
 body anymore it's no sound soundless there's no surf if a photon a sightlesstimeless because after while early on
 you actually hear your heart but then that you you sort of adapt to that andthen sort of the passage of time ceases
 yeah and if you train yourself like in a meditation not to swing early on youthink aloud you it's a little bit spooky
 you feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think well I'm gonna get bored butwhich I do not to think actively you
 become mindless so there you are body less timeless you know sound lesssightless mindless but you're in a
 conscious experience you're not asleep you're not asleep you're you you arebeing of pure your pure being there
 isn't any function you aren't doing any computation you're not rememberingyou're not projecting you're not
 planning yet you're fully conscious

Speaker 1 :you're fully conscious there's something
 going out there it could be just a side effect so what is the the you mean

Speaker 0 :epiphenomenon so what is the salaat


Speaker 1 :effect meaning why what what what what
 is the function of you being able to lay in this sense sensory free deprivationtank and still have a conscious
 experience

Speaker 0 :additionally myself obviously we didn't
 evolve with flotation tanks in our in our environment I mean so biology is nottotally bad at asking why question to
 the nominal question why do we have two eyes why don't we have four eyes orthree eyes or something well no there's
 probably a there is a function to that but it's we're not very good atanswering those questions we can
 speculate endlessly where biology is very or science is very good aboutmechanistic question why is that charged
 in the universe right we find a certain universe where there positive negativecharges why why does quantum mechanics
 Hall you know what why doesn't some other theory holdquantum mechanics hold in our universe
 is very unclear why so Tillie nominal question why questions are difficult toanswer clearly there's some relationship
 between complexity brain processing power and consciousness but however inthese cases in these three examples RK I
 gave one is an everyday experience at night the other one is a young Tom onthird one it's in principle you can
 everybody can have these sort of mystical experiences you have adissociation of function form of
 intelligence from from conscious no

Speaker 1 :consciousness you caught me asking a
 white question let me ask a question that's not a white question you'regiving a talk later today on the Turing
 test for intelligence and consciousness drawing lines between the two so isthere a scientific way to say there's
 consciousness present in this entity or not and to anticipate your answerbecause
 you also there's a neurobiological answer so we can test a human brain butif you take a machine brain that you
 don't know tests for yet how would you even begin to approach a test if there'sconsciousness present in this thing okay


Speaker 0 :that's a really good question so let me
 take in two steps so as you point out for for for for humans let's just stickwith humans there's now a test called
 the zap and zip it's a procedure where you ping the brain using transcranialmagnetic stimulation you look at the
 electrical reverberations essentially using EEG and then you can measure thecomplexity of this plain response and
 you can do this in a way people in asleep normal people you can do it in awake people and then anesthetize them
 you can do it in patients and it's it it has hundred percent accuracy that in allthose cases when you're clear the
 patient or the person is either conscious or unconscious the complexityis either high or low and then you can
 adopt these techniques to similar creatures like monkeys and dogs and andand mice that have very similar brains
 now of course you you point out that may not help you because we don't have acortex you know and if I send a magnetic
 pulse into my iPhone or my computer it's probably gonna break something so wedon't have that so what we need
 ultimately we need a theory of consciousness we can't just rely on ourintuition our intuition is well yeah if
 somebody talks they're conscious however then they're all these page childrenbabies don't talk right but we believe
 that that the babies also have conscious experiences right and then there arethese patients I mentioned did and they
 don't talk when you dream you can't talk because you're paralyzed so so whatwould we ultimately need we can't just
 rely on our intuition we need a theory of constants that tells us what is itabout a piece of matter what is it about
 a piece of highly excitable matter like the brain or like a computer that giverise to conscious experience we all
 believe none of us believe anymore in the old story it's a soul but that usedto be the most common explanation that
 most people accept that in still a lot of people today believe well there'sthere's God and doubt only us was a
 special thing that animals don't have Rene Descartes famously said a dog if hehit it with your carriage may Yelp me
 cry but it doesn't have this special thing it doesn't have the magic themagic salt oh yeah
 it doesn't have restaurants the soul now we believe that isn't the case anymoreso what is the difference between brains
 and and these guys silicon and in particular once a behavior matches so ifyou have cereal of tea or Alexan 20
 years from now that she can talk just as good as any possible human what countsdo you have to say she's not conscious
 in particular if she says it's of course he well cuz I'm conscious you are sirare you doing and she'll say well you
 know they will generate some way to yeah she'll behave like a like a person nowthere are several differences one is so
 this relates to the problem they're very hardwhy is consciousness a hard problem it's
 because it's subjective right only I have it for only I know I've directexperience of my own consciousness I
 don't have experience your consciousness now I assume as a sort of Bayesianperson who believes in probability
 theory and all of that you know I can do I can do an abduction to the to the bestavailable facts I deduce your brain is
 very similar to mine if I put you in a scanner your brain is graphic on abehavior same with I do if if you know
 if I give you this muesli and ask you how does it taste you tell me thingsthat you know that that I would also say
 more or less I yes so I infer based on all of that that you're conscious nowwe're silly I can't do that so there I
 really need a theory that tells me what is it about above any system this orthis it makes it conscious and we have


Speaker 1 :such a theory yes so the the integrator
 information theory is but let me first maybe his introduction for people arenot familiar the car can you you talked
 a lot about pants psychism can you describe what physicalism versus dualismthis you mentioned the soul what what is
 the history of that idea what the idea

Speaker 0 :psychism although the debate really out


Speaker 1 :of which pan site-- chasm can emerge of
 dualism versus physicalism or do you not see pants psychism is fitting into that

Speaker 0 :and no you can argue there's some well
 ok so let's step back so kemp psychism is a very ancient belief that's beenaround
 I mean Plato and us talks about it modern philosophers talkabout it of course in Buddhism the idea
 is very prevalent that I mean the different versions of it one versionsays everything is in sold everything
 arcs and stones and dogs and people and forests and iPhones all of us all rightall matter is in soil that's sort of one
 version another version is that all biology all creatures small a large froma single cell to a giant sequoia tree
 feel like something that's one I think is somewhat more realisticso the different were willing me invite


Speaker 1 :feel like something I have have feeling


Speaker 0 :have some kind of like some it may well
 be possible that it feels like something to be a Paramecium I think it's prettylikely it feels like something to be a
 bee or a mouse or dog sure so okay so so

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :that you can see that's also so pants
 item is very bored and you can to some people for example Bertrand Russelltry to advocate this for this idea it's
 called gazelian monism that that pant psychism is really physics viewed fromthe inside so the idea is that physics
 is very good at describing relationship among objects like charges or likegravity all right you know this card the
 relationship between curvature and mass distribution okay that's therelationship among thing physics doesn't
 really describe the ultimate reality itself it's just relationship among youknow quarks or all these other stuffs


Speaker 1 :from like a third-person observer yeah


Speaker 0 :yes and consciousness is what physics
 feels from the inside so my conscious experience it's a way the physics of mybrain particular my cortex feel from the
 inside and so if you are Paramecium you gotta remember you see Paramecium wellthat's a pretty dumb creature this but
 it has already a billion different molecules probably you know fivethousand different proteins assembled in
 a highly highly complex system that no single person no computer system so faron this planet has ever managed to
 accurately simulate its complexity vastly escapes us yes and it may well bethat that little thing feels like a tiny
 bit now it doesn't have a voice in the head like me it doesn't haveexpectations you know it doesn't have
 all that complex things but it may well if you like something yep so this is

Speaker 1 :really interesting can we draw some
 lines and maybe try to understand the difference between life intelligence andconsciousness how do you see all of
 those if you have to define what is a living thing what is a conscious thingand what is an intelligent thing do
 those intermix for you or they totally

Speaker 0 :separate okay so a that's a question
 that we don't have a full answer right

Speaker 1 :after a lot of this stuff we're talking
 about today is full of mysteries and fascinating ones right it was

Speaker 0 :approximately can go to Aristotle who's
 probably the most important scientists and philosophers ever lived in certainlyin Western culture he had this idea it's
 called halo morphism it's quite popular these days that there are differentforms of soul the soul is really the
 form of something he saw he says all biological creature have a vegetativesoul that's life principle today we
 think we understand something molded it's biochemistry nonlinearthermodynamics all right then he says
 they have a sensitive so only animals and humans have also a sensitive soul oran appetitive soul they they can see
 they can smell and they have drives they want to repeat use they want to eat etcand then only humans have what he called
 a rational soul okay right and that idea that made it into christen dome and thenthe rational soul is the one that lives
 forever he was very young he wasn't really I mean different readings ofAristotle give different was that did he
 believe that rational soul was immortal or not I probably think he didn't butthen of course that made it into its who
 Plato in the Christianity and then this world became immortal and then becamethe connection where after to God now
 you so you ask me essentially you what does our modern conception of these freeAristotle would have called them
 different forms life we think we know something about it at least life on thisplanet right although we don't
 understand how to originate it but it's it's been difficult to rigorously pindown you see this in modern definition
 of death it's in de facto right now there's a conference ongoing again thattries to defined
 legally and medically what is death it used to be very simple des is you stopbreathing your heart stops beating
 you're dead right yeah totally unconvertedif you're unsure you wait another 10
 minutes if the patient doesn't breathe you know he'swell now we have ventilators we have
 half a pacemaker so it's much more difficult to define what death istypically des is defined at the end of
 life and life is defined before yes so before that okay so we don't have reallyvery good definitions intelligence we
 don't have a rigorous data definition we know something how to measure it'scalled IG IQ or G factors right and and
 we're beginning to build it in in a narrow sense right like go alphago andand and and Watson and you know Google
 cars and uber cars and all of that that still narrow AI and some people arethinking about the artificial general
 intelligence but roughly as we said before it's something lose ability tolearn and to adapt to new environments
 but that is as I said also it's radical difference from experience and it's veryunclear if you build a machine that has
 AGI it's not at all a priori it's not at all clear that this machine will haveconsciousness it may or may not so let's


Speaker 1 :ask it the other way do you think if you
 were to try to build an artificial general intelligence system do you thinkfiguring out how to build artificial
 consciousness would help you get to an AGI so or put another way do you thinkintelligent requires consciousness in


Speaker 0 :human it goes hand in hand
 in human or I think Ambala G consciousness intelligence goes hand inhand quite a solution because the the
 brain evolved to be highly complex complexity via the theory integratedinformation theory is sort of ultimately
 is what is closely tied to consciousness ultimately it's causal power upon itselfand so in evolution evolved systems they
 go together in artificial system particular in digital machines they donot go together and if you asked me
 point-blank is Alexa 20 point O in the year 2041 shecan easily pass every Turing test is she
 conscious no even if she claims she's concerts in fact you could even do amore radical version of this thought
 experiment we can build a computer simulation of the human brain you knowwhat Henry Markram
 in the Blue Brain Project or the human brain project in Switzerland is tryingto do let's grant him all the success so
 in ten years we have this perfect simulation of the human brainevery new one is simulated in
 hasil Amex and it has motor neurons it has a Ibaka's area and of course it'lltalk and it'll say hi I just woken up I
 feel great okay even that computer simulation that can imprint some map onto your brain will not be conscious why
 because it simulates it's a difference between the simulated and the real so itsimulates the behavior salted with
 consciousness it might be it will if it's done properly will have all theintelligence that that particular person
 they're simulating has but simulating intelligence is not the same as havingconscious experiences and I'll give you
 a really nice metaphor that engineers and physicists stupidly get I can writedown in Stein's field equation nine or
 ten equations that describe the link in general relativity between curvature andand mass I can do that I can run this on
 my laptop to to predict that the sample the black hole at the center of ourgalaxy will be so massive that it will
 twist space-time around it so no light can escape I it's a black hole right butfunny have you ever won that why doesn't
 this computer simulation suck me in alright it simulates gravity but itdoesn't have the causal power of gravity
 it's a huge difference so it's a difference between the real and and thesimulator just like it doesn't get wet
 inside the computer when the computer runs code that simulates a weather stormand so in order to have to have
 artificial continents you have to give it the same causal power as a humanbrain yes you have to build so-called a
 neuromorphic machine that has hardware that is very similar to the human brainnot a digital clock for normal computer


Speaker 1 :so that's just to clarify though you
 think that consciousness is not required to create human level intelligence itseems to accompany in the human brain
 but for a machine not of court so maybe just because this is AGI let's dig in alittle bit about what we mean by
 intelligence so one thing is the G factor these kind of IQ tests ofintelligence but I think if you maybe
 another way to say so in 2040 2050 people will have Siri that isjust really impressive do you think
 people will say serious intelligent yes intelligence is this amorphous thing soit to be intelligent it seems like you
 have to have some kind of connections with other human beings in a sense thatyou have to impress them with your
 intelligence and their feels you have to somehow operate in this world full ofhumans and for that there feels like
 there has to be something like consciousness so you think you can havejust the world's best natural NLP system
 natural language understanding a generation and that will be that willget us happy and say you know what we've
 created an AGI I don't know happy no

Speaker 0 :well yes I do believe we can get what we
 call high-level functional intelligence particular sort of the G you know thisthis fluid like intelligence that we
 cherish particularly the place like MIT right in in in machines I see a boy Iknow reasons and I see a lot of reason
 to believe it's gonna happen very you know over the next 50 years of 30 years

Speaker 1 :so for beneficial AI for creating an AI
 system that's so you mentioned ethics that is exceptionally intelligent butalso does not do does you know aligns
 its values with our values as humanity do you think then in his consciousness

Speaker 0 :yes I think that that is a very good
 argument that if we're concerned about AI and the threat of a aisle and NickBostrom accidentally said I think having
 an intelligent that has empathy right why do we find abusing a dog why do mostof us find that apartment abusing any
 animal right why do we find that apartment because we have this thingcalled empathy which if you look at the
 Greek really means feeling with I feel a compass of empathy I have feeling withyou
 I see somebody else suffer that isn't even my conspecific it's not a personit's not a lot but it's not my wife or
 my kids it's it's a dog but I feel naturally most of us not all of us mostof us will feel emphatic and so it may
 well be in the long-term interest of survival of Homo sapiens sapiens that ifwe do build AGI and it really becomes
 very powerful that it has an emphatic response anddoesn't just exterminate humanity so as


Speaker 1 :part of the full conscious experience to
 create a consciousness artificial or in our human consciousness do you thinkfear maybe we're gonna get into the
 earlier days with Mitch and so on but do you think fear and suffering areessential to have consciousness do you
 have to have the full range of experience of it to have a system thathas experience or can you have a system
 that only has a very particular kinds of very positive experiences look you can

Speaker 0 :have in principle you can people have
 done this in the rat where you implanted electrode in the hypothalamus thepleasure center of the head and the rat
 stimulated some above and beyond anything else it doesn't care about foodor natural sex or drink anymore to
 stimulate itself because it's it's such a pleasurable feeling I guess it's likean orgasm just you have you know all day
 long and so a priori I see no reason why you need different forever I need agreat variety now clearly to survive
 that wouldn't work but if I'd engineered artificially I don't think I don't thinkyou need a great variety of conscious
 expense you could have just pleasure or just fear it might be a terribleexistence but I think that's possible at
 least on conceptual logical count cause any real creature whether artificiallyengineered you want to give it fear the
 fear of extinction that we all have and you also want to give it a positiveappetitive states states that it wants
 to that you want the Machine encouraged to do because if they give the Machinepositive feedback so you mentioned


Speaker 1 :pants.i chasm to jump back a little bit
 you know everything having some kind of mental property how do you go from thereto something like human consciousness so
 everything having some elements of consciousness - well is there somethingspecial about human consciousness what


Speaker 0 :so so just it's not everything like a
 spoon there's no I the the form of Pam JochumI think about doesn't ask I
 consciousness - anything like this the spoonmy liver however it is the theory the
 integrated information theory does say that system even ones that look from theoutside relatively simple Atlee if they
 have this internal causal power they are they it does feel like something thetheory a poet doesn't see anything
 what's special about human biologically we know what the one thing that specialabout human is we speak and we have a
 overblown sense of our own importance rightwe believe we exceptional and where does
 God's give - - into the universe but the but behaviorally the main thing that wehave we can plant we can plan over the
 long term and we have language and that gives us enormous amount of power andthat's why we are there the current
 dominant species on the planet

Speaker 1 :so you mentioned God you grow up a
 devout Roman Catholic you know Roman Catholic family so you know withconsciousness you're sort of exploring
 some really deeply fundamental human things that religion also touches on sowhere does where does religion fit into
 your thinking about consciousness and you've you've grown throughout your lifeand changed your views and religion as
 far as I understand yeah I mean I'm now

Speaker 0 :much closer to so I'm not a Roman
 Catholic anymore I don't believe there's sort of this God the God I was I waseducated to believe in you know sits
 somewhere in the fullness of time I'll be united in some sort of everlastingbliss I just don't see any evidence for
 that look the world the night is large and full of Wonders right there are manythings that I don't understand I think
 many things that we as a cult I look we don't even understand more than fourpercent of all the universe right dark
 matter dark energy we have no idea what it is maybe it's lost socks what do Iknow so so all I can tell you is it's a
 sort of mom my current religious or spiritual sentiments much closer to someform of Buddhism can you - without the
 reincarnation unfortunately there's no evidence for in

Speaker 1 :reincarnation so can you describe the
 way Buddhism sees the world a little bit

Speaker 0 :well so the you know they talk about so
 when when I spent several meetings with with the Dalai Lama and what alwaysimpressed me
 about him he really unlike for example at either the Pope was some Cardinal healways emphasized minimizing the
 suffering of all creatures so they have this from the early beginning they lookat suffering in all creatures not just
 in people but in in everybody this universal and of course by degrees rightin an animal
 Jerell will have less is less capable of suffering than a then a well developednormally developed human and they think
 consciousness pervades in this universe and they have these techniques you knowyou can think of them like mindfulness
 etc and meditation that tries to access sort of what they claim of this morefundamental aspect of reality I'm not
 sure it's more fundamentalist I think about it there's a physical and thenthis is inside view consciousness and
 those are the two aspects that's the only thing I've I have access to in mylife and you gotta remember my conscious
 experience and your conscious experience comes prior to anything you know aboutphysics comes PI to knowledge about the
 universe and atoms and super strings and molecules and all of that the only thingyou directly are acquainted with is this
 world that's populated with with things in images and and sounds in your headand touches on all of that I actually


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :have a question so and it sounds like
 you kind of have a rich life you talk about rock climbing and it seems likeyou really love literature and
 consciousness is all about experiencing things so do you think that has helpedyour research on this topic
 yes particular if you think about it the the various states so for example you doour climbing or now I do
 oink-cool going and a bike every day you can get into this thing called the zoneand I've always I want to I want to Bob
 about a particular with respect to consciousness because it's a strangelyaddictive state you want to you want to
 appear I mean once people have it once you want to keep on going back to it andyou wonder what is it so addicting about
 it and I think it's the experience of almost close to pure experience becausein this in the zone you're not conscious
 over in a voice anymore but there's always this inner voice nagging youright you have to do this you have to do
 that you have to pay your taxes yet this fight was your ex and all of thosethings are always there but when you're
 in the zone all of that is gone and your justice in this wonderful statewhile you're fully out in the world a
 job you're climbing or you're hauling or biking or doing soccer what or whateveryou're doing and sort of consciousness
 sort of is is your all action or in this case of pure experience you're notaction at all but in both cases you
 experience some aspect of of can't you touch some basic part of off ofconscious existence that is so basic and
 so deeply satisfying you I think you touch the root of being that's reallywhat you're touching there you're
 getting close to the root of being and that's very different from intelligence

Speaker 1 :so what do you think about the
 simulation hypothesis simulation theory the idea that we all live in a computer

Speaker 0 :simulation have you knowit's justice for
 her I think it's as likely as the hypothesis had engaged hundreds ofscholars for many centuries are we all
 just existing in the mind of God right right and this is just a modern versionof it it's it's it's it's equally
 plausible people love talking about these sorts of things I know their bookwritten is about the simulation
 hypothesis if that's what people want to do that's fine it seems rather esotericit's never testable but it's not useful


Speaker 1 :for you to think of in those terms so
 maybe connecting to the questions of free will which you've talked about Ithink vaguely wherever you saying that
 the idea that there's no free will it makes you very uncomfortable so what doyou think about free will and from that
 you from a physics perspective or a consciousness perspective what is it all

Speaker 0 :okay so from the physics perspective
 leaving inside quantum mechanics we believe we live in a fully deterministicworld right but then comes of course
 quantum mechanics so now we know that certain things on principle notpredictable which as you said I prefer
 because the idea that at the initial condition of the universe and theneverything else we're just acting out
 the initial condition of the universe that doesn't that doesn't mean it's not

Speaker 1 :a romantic notion no certainly not right


Speaker 0 :now when it comes to consciousness I
 think we do have certain freedom we are much more constrained by a physics ofcourse and by our past and by our own
 conscious desires and what our parents told us andwhat our environment tells us we we all
 know that our there's hundreds of experiments that show how we can beinfluenced but finally in the in the
 final analysis when you make a lifetime talk not really about critical decisionwhat you really think should I marriage
 should I go to this school that could should I take this job is that jobshould I cheat on my taxes or not these
 sort of these are things what you really deliberate and I think under thoseconditions you are as free as you can be
 when you when you bring your entire being anti conscious being to thatquestion and try to analyze it on all
 the the various condition and then you take you make a decision you are as freeas you can ever be that is I think what
 what free will is it's not a will that's totally free to do anything it wantsthat's not possible right so as Jack


Speaker 1 :mentioned yet you actually read a blog
 about books you've read amazing books from I'm Russian from Bulgakov cha oh

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah Neil Gaiman Carl Sagan Murakami so
 what is a book that early in your life transformed the way you saw the worldsomething that changed your life


Speaker 0 :Nietzsche against did that spokes are
 twister because he talks about some of these problems you know he was one ofthe first discoverer of the unconscious
 this is you know a little bit before for it when it was in the air and you knowhe makes all these claims that people
 sort of under the guise or under the mask of charity actually are very noncharitable so he sort of really the
 first discoverer of the great land of the of the unconscious and that thatreally struck me and what do you think


Speaker 1 :what do you think about the unconscious
 what do you think about Freud we think about these ideas what's what's justlike dark matter in the universe what's
 over there in that unconscious a lot I

Speaker 0 :mean much more than we think this is
 what a lot of last hundred years of research has shown so I think he was agenius misguided towards the end but he
 was all he started out as a neuroscientist but he contributed he didthe studies on the on the lamprey he
 contributed himself to the neon hypothesis the idea that therediscreet units that we call nerve cells
 now and then he started then he he vote you know about the unconscious and Ithink it's to there's lots of stuff
 happening you feel this particular when you're in a relationship and it breaks ason alright and then you have this
 terrible you can have love and hate and lust and anger and all of its mixed inand when you try to analyze yourself why
 am I so upset it's very very difficult to penetrate to those basements thosecaverns in your mind because the prying
 eyes of conscience doesn't have access to those but they're they are made inthe amygdala or you know lots of other
 places they make you upset or angry or sad or depressed and it's very difficultto try to actually uncover the reason
 you can go to a shrink you can talk with your friend endlesslyyou couldn't start finally a story why
 this happened why you love you or don't love or whatever but you don't reallyknow whether that's actually the with
 that that actually happened because you simply don't have access to those partsof the brain and they're very powerful
 you think that's a feature or a bug of

Speaker 1 :our brain the fact that we have this
 deep difficult to dive into subconscious

Speaker 0 :I think it's a feature because otherwise
 look we are we are see is like any other brain or nervous system or computer weare severely band-limited if we if
 everything I do every emotion I feel every my movements I make if all of thathad to be another control of
 consciousness I couldn't I I couldn't I wouldn't be here all right so so whatyou do early on your brain you have to
 be conscious when you learn things like typing or like riding on a bike but thenyou what you do you train up or out I
 think that involve basal ganglia and stratum you bear you train up differentparts of your brain and then once you do
 it automatically like typing you can show you do it much faster without eventhinking about it because you've got
 this highly specialized what Francis Crick and I called zombie agents thatare sort of that taking care of that
 while your consciousness can sort of worry about the abstract sense of thetext you want to write and I think
 that's true for many many things but for

Speaker 1 :the things like all the fights you have
 with the ex-girlfriend things that you would think are not useful to stilllinger somewhere in the sub
 conscious so that seems like a bug that it would stay there you think it would

Speaker 0 :be better if you can analyze it and then
 get it out of there or just forget it

Speaker 1 :ever happened you know that that seems a
 very buggy kind of well yeah but in

Speaker 0 :general we don't have and that's
 probably functional we don't have an ability unless it's extremely of casesclinical dissociations right when people
 are heavily abused when they completely repress them they the memory but thatdoesn't happen in in in you know in
 normal people if we don't have an ability to remove traumatic memories andof course we suffer from that on the
 other hand probably if you had the ability to constantly wipe your memoryyou probably do it to an extent that
 isn't useful to you

Speaker 1 :so yeah it's a good question with the
 balance so on the books is Jack mentioned correct me if I'm wrong butbroadly speaking in academia and the
 different scientific disciplines certainly an engineering readingliterature seems to be a rare pursuit
 perhaps I'm wrong in this but that's in my experience most people are read muchmore technical text and do not sort of
 escape or seek truth in literature it seems like you do so what do you thinkis the value what do you think
 literature asks the pursuit of scientific truth do you think it's goodit's useful for given access to much


Speaker 0 :wider array of human experiences how


Speaker 1 :valuable do you think it is well if you


Speaker 0 :want to understand human nature and
 nature in general then I think you have to better understand wide variety ofexperiences not just sitting in a lab
 staring at a screen and having a face flashed onto you've won a millionpushing a button that's what that's what
 I used to do that for most psychologists do there's nothing wrong with that butyou need to consider lots of other
 strange states you know and literature

Speaker 1 :is a shortcut for this well yeah as


Speaker 0 :literature that's that's what literature
 is all about all sorts of interesting experiences that people have the youknow the contingency of it the fact that
 you know women experience what different black people experience the worlddifferent and you know the one way to
 explain that is reading all these different literature and try to find outyou you see everything so relative
 read eBooks million years ago they thought about certain problems very verydifferently than us today we today like
 any culture think we know it all that's common to every culture every culturebelieves that at a day they know it all
 and then you realize well there's other ways of viewing the universe and some ofthem may have lots of things in their
 favor so I this is a question I wanted

Speaker 1 :to ask about time scale or scale in
 general when you with IIT or in general try to think about consciousness try tothink about these ideas we kind of
 naturally think in human timescales do you or and also entities that aresized close to humans do you think of
 things that are much larger much smaller its containing consciousness and do youthink of things that take you know well
 is this you know it ages eons to uh to operate in their conscious cause effectcause effect it's a very good question


Speaker 0 :so I think a lot about small creatures
 because experimentally you know a lot of people work on fly then and bees alrightso and most people just think they are
 tormented a this box for heaven's sake right but if you look at their behaviorlike bees they can recognize individual
 humans they have this very complicated way to communicate if you've ever beeninvolved or you know your parents when
 they bought a house what sort of agonizing decision that is and bees haveto do that once a year right when they
 swarm in this spring and then they have this very lab that way they have threenut Scouts it did they go to the
 individual sites they come back there this power this dance literally wherethey danced for several days they try to
 recruit other needs is that a complicated decision wait when theyfinally want to make a decision the
 entire swarm the scouts warm up the entire swarm then go to one locationthey don't go to fifty location they go
 to one location that the scouts have agreed upon by themselves that's awesomeif you look at the circuit complexity
 it's 10 times more denser than anything we have in our brain or the only of amillion neurons but then you know it's
 amazing complex complex behavior very complicated circuitry so there's noquestion they experience something their
 life is very different they're tiny they only live you know for four workerslive maybe for two months so I think IIT
 tells you this in principle the substrate of consciousness is thesubstrate that maximizes the
 cause-effect power over all possible spacetemple grains so when I think about for
 example do you know the science fiction story the black cloud okay it's aclassic by Fred Hoyle the astronomer he
 has this cloud intervening between the earth and the sand the Sun and leadingto some sort of to global cooling this
 is written in the 50s it turns out you can using the the radio dish theycommunicate was actually an entity it's
 actually an intelligent entity and they they sort of they convinced it to moveaway so here you have a radical
 different entity and in principle IT says well you can measure the theintegrated information in principle at
 least and yes if that if the maximum of that occurs at a time scale of monthrather than enough it sort of fraction
 of a second yes and they would experience life where each moment is amonth rather than or microsecond right
 rather than a fraction of a second in in the human case and so there may be formsof constants that we simply don't
 recognize for what they are because they are so radically different from anythingyou and I are used to again that's why
 it's good to read or to watch science fiction what we want to think about thislike this is friend you know Stanislav
 LEM this polish science fiction writer he wrote Solaris I was turned into aHollywood movie yes
 his best novel it was in the 60s if there is a very ingenious andengineering background his most
 interesting novel is called the victorious where human civilization theythey they they they have this mission to
 this planet and everything is destroyed and they discover machines humans gotkilled and then these machines took or
 when there was a machine evolution a Darwinian evolution he talks about thisvery vividly and finally the dominant
 they're the dominant machine intelligence organism that survivethey're gigantic clouds of little
 hexagonal Universal salata mater this is what in the Cygnus so typically they areall lying on the ground individual by
 themselves but in times of crisis they can't communicate the assembly intogigantic Nets into clouds trillions of
 these particles and then they become hyper intelligent and they can beatanything that Youmans can can control at
 it it's a very beautiful and compelling where you have an intelligence wherefinally the humans
 leave the planet they simply unable to understand and comprehend this creatureand they can say well either we can nuke
 the entire plan and destroy it or we just have to leave because fundamentallyit's an it's an alien it's so alien from
 us and our ideas that we cannot communicate with themyeah actually in conversation so your


Speaker 1 :talent US Steel or from brought up is
 that there could be his ideas you know you already have these artificialgeneral intelligence like super smart or
 maybe conscious beings in the cellular Tom so we just don't know how to talk tothem so it's the language the
 communication because you don't know what to do with it so that's one sort ofview is consciousness there's only
 something you can measure so it's not conscious if you can't measure it but so

Speaker 0 :you're making an ontological and an
 epistemic statement one is there they are it's it's just like seeing theirmultiverses that might be true but I
 can't communicate with them I don't have I can't have any also that's anepistemic argument right so those are
 two different things so may well be possible look at not in other casethat's happening right now people are
 building these mini organoids do you know about this so you know youcan take stem cells from under your arm
 put in one dish add four transcription factors and then you can induce them tocode to go into large or large they're a
 few millimeters they're like a half a million neurons that look like matter ofcells in a dish called mini organoids
 at Howard at Stanford everywhere they're building them it may be well be possiblethat they're beginning to feel like
 something but we we can't really communicate with them right now sopeople are beginning to think about the
 ethics of this right so yes he may be perfectly right but they made its onequestion are they conscious or not it's
 totally separate question how would I know those are two different thingsright if you could give advice to a


Speaker 1 :young researcher sort of dreaming of
 understanding or creating human level intelligence or consciousness what would

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you say


Speaker 0 :follow your dreams read widely no I mean


Speaker 1 :I suppose what discipline what what is
 the pursuit that they should take on is it neuroscience this is a competitioncognitive science is it philosophy is a
 computer science or products no in in a sense that okay so the only

Speaker 0 :known system that have high level of
 intelligence is Homo sapiens so if you wanted to build it it's probably good tocontinue to study closely what humans do
 so cognitive neuroscience you know somewhere between cognitive neuroscienceon the one hand and some philosophy of
 mind and then ai ai computer science you can look at all the original ideas inyour network they all came from
 neuroscience right reinforcement whether it's snarky Minsky building is snarky orwhether it's you know the early supalen
 visa experiment that how about that then gave rise to networks and thenmulti-layer networks so it may well be
 possible in fact some people argue that to make the next big step in AI oncewe'll realize the limits of deep
 convolutional net works but they can do certain things but they can't reallyunderstand but they don't they don't
 really can't really I can't really show them one image I can show you a singleimage of some knee a pickpocket who
 steals a wallet from a purse you immediately know that's a big pocketright now computer system will just say
 well it's a man it's a woman it's a purse right unless you train thismachine on showing it a hundred thousand
 pickpockets right so it doesn't it doesn't have this easy understandingthat you have right so so some people
 make yeah I mean in order to go to the next step or you really want to buildmachines that understand in a way you
 and I we have to go to psychology we need to understand how we do it and ourbrains enable us to do it and so
 therefore being on the cusp it's also so exciting I'd to try to understand betterour nature and then to build to take
 some of those inside and build them so I think the most exciting thing issomewhere in the interface between
 cognitive science neuroscience AI computer science and philosophy of mindbeautiful yeah I'd say if there is from


Speaker 1 :the machine learning for from the
 computer science computer vision perspective many of the researchers kindof ignore the way the human brain works
 nor even psychology or literature or studying the brain I would hope JoshTenenbaum talks about bringing that in
 more and more and that's yeah so you've worked on some amazing stuff throughoutyour life what's the thing that you're
 really excited about what's the mystery that you would love to uncover in thenear term beyond
 beyond all the mysteries already surrounded by well so there's a

Speaker 0 :structure called the Klaus poem
 this is structures underneath our cortex it's yay big you have one on the left ami right underneath this pie underneath a
 insula it's very sane it's like one millimeter it's embedded in in wiring inwhite matters it's very difficult to
 image and it has it has connection to every cortical region and Francis Crickthe last paper you have of all he
 dictated Corrections the day he died in hospital on this paperhe now we hyper hypothesize well because
 it has this unique Anatomy it gets input from every cortical area and projectsback to every call every cortical area
 that the function of this structure is similar that it's just a metaphor towork the role of a conducting and
 symphony orchestra you've all the different corticalplayers you have some that do motion
 some they do theory of mind some that infer social interaction and color I'mhearing and all the different modules
 and cortex but of course what consciousness is consciousness puts itall together into one package like the
 binding problem all of that and this is really the function because it has arelatively few nuance compared to cortex
 but it it talks it is all receive the input from all of them and it projectsback to all of them and so we are
 testing that right now we've got this beautiful neuronal reconstruction in themouse called crown of song and town of
 Thal nuan said there in the closed room that if the most widespread connectionof any nerve Neon I've ever seen they're
 very deep yeah you have individually on to sit in the clouds from tiny but thenthey have this very single you have this
 huge axonal tree that cover both FC and contralateral cortex and and trying toturn using you know fancy tools like
 optogenetics trying to turn those neurons on or off and study it whathappens in them in the mouse so this


Speaker 1 :thing is perhaps where the parts become
 the whole it very interface it's one of

Speaker 0 :the structures it's a very good way of
 putting it where the the individual parts turn into the whole of the wholeof the conscious experience well with


Speaker 1 :that thank you very much for being here
