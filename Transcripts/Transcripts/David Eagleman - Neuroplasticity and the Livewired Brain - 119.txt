Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 david eagleman a neuroscientist and one of the great sciencecommunicators of our time
 exploring the beauty and mystery of the human brainhe is an author a lot of amazing books
 about the human mind and his new one called livewiredlivewired is a work of 10 years on a
 topic that is fascinating to me which is neuroplasticity or themalleability of the human brain

 let me say that the adaptability of the human mindat the biological chemical cognitive
 psychological and even sociological levels is the verything that captivated me
 many years ago when i first began to wonder how would i engineersomething like it in the machine the
 open question today in the 21st century is what are thelimits of this adaptability
 as new smarter and smarter devices and ai systems come to lifeor as better and better brain computer
 interfaces are engineered will our brain be able to adaptto catch up to excel i personally
 believe yes that we're far from reaching thelimitation of the human mind
 and the human brain just as we are far from reaching the limitationsof our computational systems if you

 the first an organization that is helping to advancerobotics and stem education for young
 people around the world and now here's my conversation withdavid
 eagleman you have a new book coming out on the changing braincan you give a high level overview of
 the book it's called live wired by the

Speaker 1 :way
 yeah the thing is we typically think about the brain in terms of themetaphors we already have like
 hardware and software that's how we build all our stuff butwhat's happening in the brain is
 fundamentally so different it's um so i coined this new term livewearwhich is a system that's constantly
 reconfiguring itself physically as it as it learns and adapts to theworld around it it's physically changing


Speaker 0 :so it's uh live wear meaning like as
 like hardware but

Speaker 1 :changing yeah exactly well it's the
 hardware and the software layers are blendedand so um you know typically
 engineers are praised for their efficiency and making something reallyclean and clear like okay here's the
 hardware layer then i'm gonna run software on top of it there's all sortsof
 universality that you get out of a piece of hardware like that that's usefulbut what the brain is doing is
 completely different and i am so excited about where this is allgoing because i feel like
 this is where our engineering will go so currently we builduh all our devices a particular way but
 you know i can't tear half the circuitry out of your cell phoneand expect it to still function but you
 can do that with uh with the brain so just as anexample kids who are under
 about seven years old can get one half of their brain removed it's called thehemispherectomy
 and and they're fine they have a slight limp on the other side of their body butum they can function just fine that way
 and uh and this is generally true you know sometimes children are born withouta hemisphere
 and their visual system rewires so that everything is on theon the single remaining hemisphere what
 thousands of cases like this teach us is that it's avery malleable system that is simply
 trying to accomplish the tasks in front of it byrewiring itself with the available real


Speaker 0 :estate how much of that
 is uh is a quark or a feature of evolution like howhow hard is it to engineer because
 evolution took a lot of work billion trillions of organisms had todie for to create this thing we have
 uh in our skull uh like because you said uh you kind of look forward to the ideathat uh
 we might be engineering our systems like this in the future but creating live warsystems
 how hard do you think is it to create

Speaker 1 :systems like that great question it has
 proven itself to be a difficult challenge but what i mean by that iseven though it's taken evolution
 a really long time to get where it is nowum we all we have to do now is peek at
 the at the blueprints it's just three poundsthis organ and
 and we just figure out how to do it but that's the part that i mean is adifficult challenge because
 you know uh there are tens of thousands of neuroscientists were all poking andprodding and trying to figure this out
 but it's an extremely complicated system butit's only going to be complicated until
 we figure out the general principles exactly like if you you know had a magiccamera and you could look inside the
 nucleus of a cell and you'd see hundreds of thousands of things movingaround whatever and then you know it
 takes crick and watts and say oh you know you're just trying to maintain theorder of the base pairs and all the rest
 is details then it simplifies it and we come tounderstand something
 that that was my goal in livewire which i've written over 10 years by the wayis to try to distill things down to the
 principles of what plastic systems are trying to accomplish

Speaker 0 :but to even just linger he said it's
 possible to be born with just one hemisphereand you still are able to function
 first of all just just to pause on that i mean that's kind of that's amazingthat's that's uh i don't know if people
 quite i mean you kind of hear things here andthere this is what i'm kind of i'm
 really excited about your book is i don't know if there's definitive uhsort of uh popular
 sources to think about the stuff i mean there's a lot ofi think from my perspective what i've
 heard is there's like been debates over decades abouthow how much neuroplasticity there is in
 the brain and so on and people have learned a lot of thingsand now it's converging towards people
 that are understanding this much more in europe much more plasticthan people realize
 but just like linger on that topic like how malleableis the hardware of the human brain
 maybe you said children at each stage of

Speaker 1 :life
 yeah so here's the whole thing i think part of the confusion about plasticityhas been that there are studies at all
 sorts of different ages and then people might read that from adistance and they think oh well
 fred didn't recover when half his brain was taken out and soclearly you're not plastic but then you
 do it with a child and they are plastic and so um part of my goal here was topull together the tens of thousands of
 papers on this both from clinical work and fromyou know all the way down to the
 molecular and understand what are the principles here the principles arethat plasticity diminishes that's no
 surprise by the way we should just define plasticity you knowit's the ability of a system to
 to mold into a new shape and then hold that shape that's whyyou know we make things that we call
 plastic um because they are moldable and they canhold that new shape like a plastic toy


Speaker 0 :or something
 and so maybe we use maybe we'll use a lot of terms that are synonymous sosomething is plastic something is
 malleable uh changing livewire the name of thebook is


Speaker 1 :is like so i'll tell you exactly right
 but i'll tell you why i chose livewire instead of plasticity so i used the termplasticity in the book but
 um but sparingly because that was a term coined by william jamesover 100 years ago
 and and he was of course very impressed with plastic manufacturing that youcould
 mold something in shape and then it holds that but that's not what'sactually happening in the brain
 it's constantly rewiring your entire life you never hitan end point the whole point is for it
 to keep changing so even in the you know few minutes ofconversation that we've been having your
 brain is changing my brain is changing um next time i see your facei will remember oh yeah like that time
 next time i sat together and we did these things and

Speaker 0 :i wonder if your brain will have like a
 lex thing going on for the next few months like you'll stay there until youget rid of it
 because it was useful for now yeah no

Speaker 1 :i'll probably never get rid of it let's
 say for some circumstance you and i don't see each other for the next 35years
 when i run into you i'll be like oh yeah

Speaker 0 :that looks familiar


Speaker 1 :yeah yeah and we yeah we sat down for a
 podcast back when there were podcasts yeah

Speaker 0 :exactly back when we lived outside
 virtual reality yeah

Speaker 1 :exactly so you chose livewire exactly
 exactly because plastic implies i mean it's the term that's used in the fieldand so that's why
 we need to use it still uh for a while but yeah it implies something getsmolded in shape and then holds that
 shape forever but in fact the whole system is completely changing then then

Speaker 0 :back to uh
 how malleable is the human brain at each stage of lifeso what just at a high level


Speaker 1 :is it malleable so yes
 and plasticity diminishes but one of the things that ifelt like i was able to put together for
 myself after reading thousands of papers on this issueis that different parts of the brain are
 have different plasticity windows so for example withthe visual cortex
 that cements itself into place pretty quickly over the course of a few yearsand i argue that's because of the
 stability of the data in other words what you're getting infrom the world you've got a certain
 number of angles colors shapes you know it's essentiallythe world is
 visually stable so that hardens around that dataas opposed to let's say the
 somatosensory cortex which is the part that's taking information from your bodyor the motor cortex right next to it
 which is what drives your body the fact is bodies are always changingyou get taller over time you get fatter
 thinner over time you you might break a leg and have to limp for a while stufflike that
 so because the data there is always changingby the way you might get on a bicycle
 you might get a surfboard things like that umbecause that data is always changing
 that stays more malleable and when you look through the brain youfind that it appears to be this
 you know how stable the data is determines how fast somethinghardens into place but the point is
 different parts of the brain harden into place at different times

Speaker 0 :do you think it's possible that uh
 depending on how much data you get on different sensorsthat it stays more malleable longer so
 like you know if you look at differentcultures of experience like
 if you keep your eyes closed or maybe you're blind i don't know butlet's say you keep your eyes closed for
 your entire life uh it that then the visual cortex mightbe much
 less malleable the reason i bring that upis like you know well maybe we'll talk
 about brain computer interfaces a little bit anddown the line but you know like is this
 uh is the malleability a genetic thing or is it more about the data like i saidthat comes in


Speaker 1 :ah so the malleability itself is a
 genetic thing the big trick that mother naturediscovered with humans is
 make a system that's really flexible as opposed to most other creatures todifferent degrees so if you take a
 an alligator it's born its brain does the same thing every generationif you compare an alligator a hundred
 thousand years ago to an alligator now they're essentially the sameum we on the other hand as humans drop
 into a world with a half-baked brain and what we require isto absorb the culture
 around us and the language and the beliefs and the customs and so on that'swhat
 mother nature has done with us and it's been a tremendously successful trickwe've taken over the whole planet as a
 result of this

Speaker 0 :so that's an interesting point i mean
 just to lingard that i mean this is a nice feature like if you were to designa thing to survive in this world
 do you put it at age zero already equippedto deal with the world in a like
 hard-coded way or do you put it do you make itmalleable and just throw it in take the
 risk that you're maybe going to die butyou're going to learn a lot in the
 process and if you don't die you'll learn a hellof a lot to be able to survive in the


Speaker 1 :environment so this is the experiment
 that mother nature ran and and it turns out that for betterworse we've won
 i mean yeah we put other animals into the zoos and weyeah that's right yeah i might do better
 okay fair enough that's true and and maybe what the trick mothernature did is just the stepping stone to
 uh to ai but

Speaker 0 :so it's that's that's a beautiful
 feature of the human brain that it's malleable but let's on thetopic of mother nature
 what do we start with like how blank is the slate

Speaker 1 :ah so it's not actually a blank slate
 what it's it's terrific engineering that's set upin there
 but much of that engineering has to do with okay just make sure thatthings get to the right place for
 example like the fibers from the eyes getting to the visual cortex or all thisvery complicated machinery in the ear
 getting to the auditory cortex and so on sothings first of all there's that
 and then what we also come equipped with is the ability to absorblanguage and culture and beliefs and so
 on so you're already set up for that so nomatter what you're exposed to you will
 you will absorb some sort of language that's the trickis how do you engineer something just
 enough that it's then a sponge that's ready to take in and fill in the blanks

Speaker 0 :how much of the malleability is hardware
 how much software is that useful at all in the brainso like what what are we talking about
 so there's like there's neurons there's uh synapsesand the all kinds of different synapses
 and there's chemical communication like electrical signals and there'schemical communication from this in the
 synapses uh what i would saythe software would be the timing and the
 nature of the electrical signals i guess and the hardware would be the actual

Speaker 1 :synapses so here's the thing this is why
 i really if we can i want to get away from thehardware and software metaphor because
 what happens is as activity passes through the systemit changes things now the thing that
 computer engineers are really used to thinking about isis synapses where two neurons connect of
 course each neuron connects with ten thousands of its neighbors butat a point where they connect um what
 we're all used to thinking about is the changing of the strength of thatconnection
 the the synaptic weight but in fact everything is changing the receptordistribution inside that
 neuron so that you're more or less sensitive to the neurotransmitterthan the structure of the neuron itself
 and and what's happening there all the way down to biochemical cascadesinside the cell all the way down to the
 nucleus and for example the epigenome which isthe
 um you know these little proteins that are attached to the dna thatcause conformational changes that cause
 more genes to be expressed or repressed all of thesethings are plastic
 the reason that most people only talk about the synaptic weightsis because that's really all we can
 measure well and all this other stuff is reallyreally hard to see with our current
 technology so essentially that just gets ignoredbut but in fact the system is plastic at
 all these different levels and mymy way of thinking about this is
 an analogy to paste layers so paste layers is a concept that stewart brandsuggested about how to think about
 cities so you have fashion which changes rapidly in citiesyou have
 um governance which changes more slowly you havethe structure the buildings of a city
 which changes more slowly all the way down toto nature you've got all these different
 layers of things that are changing at different paces at different speedsi've taken that idea and and mapped it
 onto the brain which is to say you have somebiochemical cascades are just changing
 really rapidly when something happens all the way down to things that are moreand more cemented in there
 and this is actually uh this actually allows us to understand a lot aboutparticular kinds of things that happen
 for example one of the oldest probably the oldest rule in neurology iscalled ribose law
 which is that older memories are more stable than newer memoriesso when you get old and demented
 you'll be able to remember things from your your young life maybe you'llremember this podcast but you won't
 remember what you did a month ago or a year ago and this is avery weird structure right
 no other system works this way where older memories are more stable thannewer members
 but it's because through time things get more and more cementedinto deeper layers of the system
 and um and so this is i think the way we have to think about the brainnot as okay you've got neurons you've
 got synaptic weights and that's it

Speaker 0 :so yeah so the idea of live where and
 live wired is it is that it's it's like a it's agradual
 yeah it's a gradual spectrum between software and hardwareand so the metaphors completely doesn't
 make sense because like when you talk aboutsoftware and hardware it's really hard
 lines i mean of course softwareis unlike card but even hardware but
 like so there's two groups but in thesoftware world there's levels of
 abstractions right there's the operating system there's machine codeand then it gets higher higher levels
 but somehow that's actually fundamentally different thanthe layers of abstractions in the
 hardware but in the brain it's all like the same i love the citythe city metaphor i mean yeah it's kind
 of mind-blowing because it it's hard to know what to uh think aboutthat like if i were to ask the question
 uh this is important question for machine learning ishow does the brain learn so
 essentially you're saying that i mean it just learns on all of thesedifferent levels at all different


Speaker 1 :paces exactly right and as a result what
 happens is as you practice something you get goodat something
 you're physically changing the circuitry you're you're adapting your brainaround the thing that is relevant to you
 so let's say you take up um do you know how to surf no okay greatso let's say you take up surfing
 yeah now at this age um what happens is you know you'll be terrible at first youknow how to operate your body you know
 how to read the waves things like that andthrough time you get better and better
 what you're doing is you're burning that into the actual circuitry of your brainyou're of course
 conscious when you're first doing it you're thinking about okay where am idoing what's my body weight
 um but eventually when you become a pro at it you are not conscious of it at allin fact you can't even
 unpack what it is that you did think about riding a bicycle youyou can't describe how you're doing
 you're just doing you're changing your balance when you come you know you dothis to go to a stop and so
 so um this is what we're constantly doing isactually shaping our own circuitry based
 on what is relevant for us survival of course being the the topthing that's relevant but interestingly
 especially with humans we have these particular goals in our lives computerscience neuroscience whatever
 and so we actually shape our circuitry around that

Speaker 0 :i mean you mentioned this gets slower
 and slower with age but is there like i've i think i've uh read andspoken
 offline even on this podcast developmental neurobiologist i guesswould be the right terminology
 is like looking at the very early like from from embryonic stem cells to liketo the to the creation of the brain and
 like that's like what that's mind-blowing how much stuffhappens there
 so it's very malleable at that stage uh it'sand then but after that at which point


Speaker 1 :does it stop being malleable
 so so that's the interesting thing is that it remains valuable your whole lifeso even
 when you're an old person you'll be able to remember new faces and names you'llbe able to learn new sorts of tasks
 and thank goodness because the world is changing rapidly in terms of technologyand so on
 i just sent my mother and alexa and she you know figured out how to go on thesettings and do the thing and i was
 really yeah i was really impressed by that she was able to do it so there areparts of the brain that remain malleable
 their whole life the interesting part is that really yourgoal
 is to make an internal model of the world your goal is to sayokay the brain uh is trapped in silence
 and darkness and it's trying to understandhow the world works out there right i


Speaker 0 :love that image
 yeah i guess it is yeah you forget you forgetit's like this this lonely thing is
 sitting in its own container and uh trying to actuallythrow a few sensors figure out what the
 what the hell's going on you know what i

Speaker 1 :sometimes think about is um
 the that movie the martian with matt damon the umit was written in a book of course but
 the the movie poster shows matt damon all alone on the red planet and i thinkgod that's actually what it's like
 to be inside your head and my head and anybody's head is thatyou're essentially on your own planet in
 there and i'm essentially on my own planet everyone's got their ownworld where you've absorbed all of your
 experiences up to this moment in your life that madeyou exactly who you are and
 same for me and everyone and um and we've got this very thin bandwidthof communication
 and i'll say something like oh yeah that tastesjust like peaches and you'll say oh i
 know what you mean but the experience of course might bemight be vastly different for
 us um but anyway yes so the brain is trapped in silence and darkness each oneof us
 and what it's trying to do this is the important part is trying to make aninternal model of what's going on out
 there as in how do i function in the worldhow do i how do i interact with other
 people do i say something nice and polite or do i say somethingaggressive and mean do i you know all
 these things that it's putting together about the worldand i think what happens when people get
 older and older it may not be that plasticity isdiminishing it may be that their
 internal model essentially has set itself up in a way where it saysokay i've pretty much got a really good
 understanding of the world now and i don't really need to changeright so when old when when much older
 people find themselves in a situation where they need to changethey can actually are able to do it it's
 just that i think this notion that we all have thatplasticity diminishes as we grow older
 is in part because the motivation isn't thereum but if you were 80 and you got fired
 from your job and suddenly had to figure out how to program a wordpresssite or something you'd figure it out


Speaker 0 :got it so the the capability the
 possibility of changes is there but let me ask the the highest challengethe interesting challenge to this uh
 plasticity to this uh livewear system uh if wecould talk about
 brain computer interfaces and neurolink what are your thoughts about the effortsof elon musk
 neuralink bci in general in this regard which is adding a machinea computer the capability of a computer
 to communicate with the brain and the brain to communicate with the computerat the very basic applications and then
 like the futuristic kind of thoughts

Speaker 1 :yeah first of all it's terrific that
 people are jumping and doing that because it's clearly thethe future the interesting part is our
 brains have pretty good methods of interacting with technologyso maybe it's your fat thumbs on a cell
 phone or something but um or maybe it's watching a youtubevideo getting into your eye that way
 but we have pretty rapid ways of communicating with technology andgetting data
 so if you actually crack open the skull and go into the inner sanctum of thebrain
 um you might be able to get a little bit faster but i'll tell youi i'm i'm not so sanguine on the
 future of that as a business and i'll tell you why it's becausethere are various ways of getting data
 in and out and an open head surgery is a big dealneurosurgeons don't want to do it
 because there's always risk of death and infection on the tableand also it's not clear how many people
 would say i'm going to volunteer to get something in my headso that i can text faster you know 20
 faster so i think it's you know mother naturesurrounds the brain with this
 armored you know bunker of the skull because it's a very delicate materialand there's an expression in
 neurosurgery um aboutthe brain is you know the person is
 never the same after you open up their skull now whether or not that's true orwhatever
 who cares but it's a big deal to do in open head surgery sowhat i'm interested in is how can we get
 information in and out of the brain without having to crack the skull open

Speaker 0 :got it without messing with the
 biologicals the part like directly uh connecting or messing withthe with the
 intricate biological thing that we got going on it seems to be working

Speaker 1 :yeah exactly and by the way where neural
 link is going which is wonderful is going to bein patient cases it really matters for
 all kinds of surgeries that a person needs whether for parkinson's orepilepsy or whatever
 it's a terrific new technology for essentially sowing electrodes in thereand getting more
 higher density of electrodes so that's great i just don't think as far as thefuture of bci goes
 i don't suspect that people will go in and say yeah drill a hole in my head anddo that


Speaker 0 :well it's interesting because uh i think
 there's a similar intuition but say in the world of autonomous vehiclesthat folks
 know how hard it is and it seems damn impossiblethe similar intuition about i'm sticking
 on the elon musk thing is just a good easy example uh similar intuition aboutcolonizing mars
 it like if you really think about it it seems extremelydifficult and uh and almost
 i mean just technically difficult to the to a degreewhere you want to ask is it really worth
 doing worth trying and then the same the sameis applied with bci
 but the thing about the future is it's hard to predict uh the theexciting thing to me
 with uh so once it does once if successful it's able to help patientsit may be
 able to discover something uh very surprising about our ability todirectly communicate with the brain so
 exactly what you're interested in is figuring out how touh play with this malleable brain but
 like help assist it somehow i mean it's such a compelling notion to methat we're now working on all these
 exciting machine learning systems that are able to learn you knowfrom data and then if we can
 have this other brain that's a learning systemthat's live wired in when on the human
 side and them to be able to communicate it's likea
 self playing mechanism was able to beat the game the world championgo so they can play with each other the
 computer and the brain like when you sleep i mean there's a lotof futuristic kind of things that
 it's just um exciting possibilities but i hear youwe understand so little about the actual
 intricacies of the communication of the brain that it's hard tofind the common language well


Speaker 1 :interestingly the
 technologies that have been built don't actually require the perfect commonlanguage so for example hundreds of
 thousands of people are walking around with artificial ears and artificial eyesmeaning cochlear implants or retinal
 implants so this is you know you take uh essentially digitalmicrophone you slip an electrode strip
 into the inner ear and people can learn how to hear thatway or you take an electrode grid and
 you plug it into the retina at the back of the eyeand people can learn how to see that way
 the interesting part is those devices don't speak exactly thenatural biological language they speak
 the dialect of silicon valley and and it turns outthat as as recently as about 25 years
 ago a lot of people thought this was never going to workthey thought it was it wasn't going to
 work for that reason but the brain figures it out it's really good atsaying okay look there's some
 correlation between what i can touch and feel and hearingand so on and the data that's coming in
 or between you know i clap my hands and i and i have signalscoming in there and it figures out how
 to speak any language

Speaker 0 :oh that's fascinating so like uh no
 matter you're no matter if it's neural link uh sodirectly communicating with the brain or
 it's a smartphone or google glass or the brainfigures out the efficient way of


Speaker 1 :communication well exactly exactly
 and what i propose is the potato head theory of evolution which is which isum that all you know our eyes and nose
 and mouth and ears and fingertips all this stuff is just plug and playand the brain can figure out what to do
 with the day that comes in and part of the reason that ithink this is right and i care so deeply
 about this is when you look across the animal kingdom you find all kinds ofweird peripheral devices plugged in
 and the brain figures out what to do with the data and i don't believe thatmother nature has to reinvent
 the principles of brain operation each timeto say oh now i'm going to have heat
 pits to detect infrared now i'm going to havesomething to detect uh you know electro
 receptors on the body now i'm going to test something to pick up the magneticfield of the earth
 with cryptochromes in the eye and so on instead the brain says oh i got itthere's data coming in
 is that useful can do something with it oh great i'm gonna mold myselfaround the data that's coming in it's


Speaker 0 :kind of
 fascinating to think that we think of smartphones and all this new technologyis novel
 as totally novel as outside of what evolution ever intended or likewhat nature ever intended
 it's fascinating to think that like the entirety of the process of evolution isperfectly fine
 and ready for the smartphone oh yeah and the internetlike it's ready it's ready to be
 valuable to that and whatever comes to cyborgs to virtual reality we kind ofthink like
 this is you know there's all these like books written about natural what'snatural
 and we're like destroying our natural cells bylike embracing all this technology it's
 kind of it's you know we're not probably notgiving the brain enough credit like
 this this thing this thing is just fine with new tech oh

Speaker 1 :exactly it wraps itself around by the
 way wait till you have kids you'll see the ease with which they pick up onstuff and
 yeah as kevin kelly said um technology is what gets invented after you're bornbut the stuff that already exists when
 you're born that's not even tech that's just background furniture like the factthat the ipad exists for my son and
 daughter like that's just background furniture soum yeah it's um because we have this
 incredibly malleable system it just absorbswhatever is going on in the world and
 learns what to do with it

Speaker 0 :so do you think just to linger for for a
 little bit more do you think it's possible toco-adjust like
 we're kind of uh you know for the machineto adjust to the brain for the brain to
 adjust the machine i guess that's what's already happening

Speaker 1 :sure that is what's happening so for
 example when when you put electrodes in the motor cortex to control a roboticarm for somebody who's paralyzed
 the engineers do a lot of work to figure out okay what can we do with thealgorithm here so that we can detect
 what's going on from these cells and figure out how to best program therobotic arm to move given the data that
 we're measuring from these cells but also the brain is learning too soyou know the paralyzed woman says
 wait i'm trying to grab this thing and by the way it's all about relevance soif there's a piece of food there and
 she's hungry she'll figure out how to get this foodinto her mouth with the robotic arm
 because that is what matters

Speaker 0 :well that's uh okay first of all that
 pain's really promising and beautiful for somereason really optimistic picture
 that you know our brain is able to to adjust to so much umyou know so many things happen this year
 2020 that you think like how we're ever goingto deal with it
 and it's somehow encouraging and inspiring that like we're going to beokay


Speaker 1 :well that's right i actually think so
 2020 has been an awful year for almost everybody in manyways but
 the one silver lining has to do with brain plasticity which is to saywe've all been on our you know on our
 gerbil wheels we've all been in our routines andand you know as i mentioned our internal
 models are all about how do you maximally succeed how do youoptimize your operation
 in this circumstance where you are right and then all of a sudden bang 2020 comeswe're completely off our wheels
 where having to create new things all the time and figure out how to do itand that is terrific for brain
 plasticity because and we know this becauseum there are very large studies
 on older people who stay cognitively active their whole livessome some fraction of them have
 alzheimer's disease physically but nobody knows that whenthey're alive even though their brain is
 getting chewed up with the ravages of alzheimer's cognitively they're doingjust fine why
 it's because they're they're they're challenged all the timethey've got all these new things going
 on all this novelty all these responsibilities chores social life allthese things happening
 and as a result they're constantly building new roadways even as partsdegrade
 and and and that's the only good news is thatwe are in a situation where suddenly we
 can't just operate like automaton anymore we have tothink of completely new ways to do
 things and that's wonderful i don't know

Speaker 0 :why this question popped into my head
 it's quite absurd but uh are we going to be okayyeah you say this is the promising
 silver lining just from your own because you've written aboutthis and thought about this outside of
 maybe even the plasticity of the brain butjust this uh this whole pandemic kind of
 changed the way it knocked us out of this uh hamsterwheel
 like that of habit a lot of people had had to reinvent themselvesunfortunately and i have a lot of
 friends who either already or or are going to losetheir business
 you know is basically it it's taking the dreams that people have hadand said like said this this dream this
 particular dream you've had will no longer be possible you have tofind something new
 what are your are we gonna be okay

Speaker 1 :yeah we'll be okay in the sense that i
 mean it's gonna be a rough time for many or most people but in the sensethat it is
 sometimes useful to find that what you thought was your dream was wasnot the thing that you're going to do
 um this is obviously the plot in lots of hollywood movies that someone says i'mgoing to do this and then that gets
 foiled and they end up doing something betterbut this is true in life i mean um
 in general even though we plan our lives as best we can it's predicatedon
 our notion of okay given everything that's around me this is what's possiblefor me next
 but it takes 2020 to knock you off that where you think oh well actually maybethere's
 something i could be doing that's bigger

Speaker 0 :that's better yeah you know for me one
 exciting thing and i just talked to grant sanderson i don't know if you knowwho he is it's a three blue one brown
 it's a youtube channel he does he's a if you see it you would recognize ithe's like a really famous
 math guy and he's a math educator and he does he's incredible beautifulvideos and now i see sort of at mit
 folks are struggling to try to figure outyou know if we do teach remotely how do
 we do it effectively so you have these um world-classresearchers and professors trying to
 figure out how to put content online that teachespeople
 and to me a possible future of that is you know nobel prize winningfaculty become youtubers
 like like that that to me is so exciting uhlike what grant said uh which is like
 the possibility of creating canonical videos on the thing you're a worldexpert in
 uh you know there's so many topics that justthe world doesn't you know there's
 faculty i mentioned russ cedric there's all these people inrobotics that
 are experts in a particular beautiful field on which there's only justpapers there's there's no popular book
 there's no there's no clean canonical videoshowing the beauty of a subject and one
 possibility is uh they they try to create that andand share it with the world this is this


Speaker 1 :is the beautiful thing this of course
 has been happening for a while already i mean for example when i go and i givebook talks often what'll happen is some
 13 year old will come up to me afterwards and say something and i'llsay
 my god that was so small like how how did you know that yeah and they'll sayoh i saw it on a ted talk well
 what an amazing opportunity here you got the thebest person in the world on subject x
 giving a 15-minute talk as as beautifully as he or she can andthe 13 year old just grows up with that
 that's just the mother's milk right yeah as opposed to when we grew up youknow i had whatever homeroom teacher i
 had and uh you know whatever classmates ihad and
 and hopefully that person knew what what he or she was teaching andoften didn't and you know just made
 things up so the the opportunity now has become extraordinaryto get
 the best of the world and the reason this matters of course is becauseobviously
 back to plasticity the way that we the way our brain gets molded is byabsorbing everything from the world
 all of the all of the knowledge and the data and so on that it can getand then um and then springboarding off
 of that and we're in a very lucky time nowbecause
 we grew up with a lot of just in case learning so you know just in case youever need to know these dates in
 mongolian history here there um but what kids are growing up with nowlike my kids is tons of just in time
 learning so as soon as they're curious about something they ask alex or theyask google home
 they get the answer right there in the context of the curiosity the reason thismatters is because
 for plasticity to happen you need to care you need to be curious aboutsomething
 and this is something by the way that the ancient romans had had notedthey had outlined seven different levels
 of learning and the highest level is when you're curious about a topicbut anyway so kids now are getting tons
 of just in time learning and as a result they're going to be somuch smarter than we are
 they're just and we can already see that i mean my boy is eight years old my girlis five
 but i mean the things that he knows are amazing because it's not justhim having to do the rote memorization
 stuff that we did yeah that's

Speaker 0 :it's just fascinating what the brain
 what young brains look like now because of all those ted talks justjust loaded in there and there's there's
 also i mean a lot of people write kind of there's a sense that ourattention span is growing shorter
 but you know it's complicated because um you know for exampleyou know most people majority of people
 it's the 80 plus percent of people listen to the entirety of this thingit's just
 two three hours forward podcast long long-form podcastsor are becoming more and more popular so
 like that's that's it's all really giant complicated messand the point is
 that the brain is able to adjust to it and somehow likeform a world view within this
 new medium of like information that we haveyou have like these short tweets and you
 have these three four hour podcasts and you have netflix movie i mean it'sjust it's adjusting to the entirety
 and just absorbing it and taking it all in and thenpops up kovid that forces us all to be
 home and it all just adjusts and and uh andfigures it out yeah yeah it's
 fascinating you know been talking about the brain asif it's
 something separate from the human that carries it a little bit likewhenever you talk about the brain
 it's easy to forget that that that's like that's usum like how much do you
 how much is the whole thing like predeterminedlike how much is it already encoded in
 there and how much is it thewhat's the uh
 the the actions the decisions the judgments

Speaker 1 :this you mean like who you are who you
 are oh yeah yeah okay great question right so there used to be a big debateabout nature versus nurture and we now
 know that it's always both you can't even separate thembecause
 you come to the table with a certain amount nature for example your wholegenome
 and so on the experiences you have in the womb like whether your mother issmoking or drinking
 things like that whether she's stressed so on those all influencehow you're going to pop out of the womb
 from there everything is an interaction between allof your experiences
 and the and the nature what i mean is i think of it like a space time conewhere you have
 you drop in the world depending on the experience that you have you might gooff in this direction or that direction
 in that direction because there's interaction all the wayyour experiences determine
 what happens with the expression of your genes so some genes get repressedsome get expressed and so on and you
 actually become a different person based on your experiencesthere's a whole field called uh
 epigenomics which is or epi epigenetics i should say which is aboutthe epigenome
 and that is the you know sort of the layer that sits on top of the dna andcauses the genes to express differently
 that is directly related to the experiences that you have so ifyou know just as an example they take
 rat pups and you know one group is sort of placed away from their parents andthe other group is
 groomed and licked and taken good care of that changes their gene expressionfor the rest of their life they go off
 in different directions in this in the space time cone um soyeah this is this is of course why it
 matters that we take care of children and pour moneyinto things like education and good
 child care and so on for children broadlyum because these formative years matter
 so

Speaker 0 :much so is there a free will


Speaker 1 :this is this is a great apologize for


Speaker 0 :the
 for the absurd high-level philosophical

Speaker 1 :questions no these are my favorite kind
 of questions here's the thing here's the thing wedon't know if you ask most
 neuroscientists they'll say that we can't really think of how youwould get free will in there because as
 far as we can tell it's a machine it's a very complicated machine enormouslysophisticated 86 billion neurons about
 the same number of glial cells each of these things is as complicatedas the city of san francisco each neuron
 in your head has the entire human genome in it it's expressingmillions of gene products these are
 incredibly complicated biochemical cascades each one is connected to 10 000of its neighbors which means you have
 you know like half a quadrillion connections inthe brain so it's it's incredibly
 complicated but it is fundamentally appears to justbe a machine
 and therefore if there's nothing in it that's not being driven bysomething else then it seems it's hard
 to understand where free will would comefrom so that's the camp that
 pretty much all of us fall into but i will say our science is still quiteyoung
 and you know i'm a fan of the history of science and whatthe thing that always strikes me is
 interesting is when you look back at any moment in scienceeverybody believes something is true and
 they just they simply didn't know about you know what einstein revealed orwhatever and so
 who knows and they all feel like that

Speaker 0 :we've at any moment in
 history they all feel like we've converted to the final answer exactly

Speaker 1 :exactly like all the pieces of the
 puzzle are there and i think that's a funny illusionthat's worth getting rid of
 and and in fact this is what drives good science is recognizing that we don'thave most of the puzzle pieces
 so as far as the free will question goes i don't knowat the moment it seems wow it would be
 really impossible to figure out how something else could fit in there butyou know 100 years from now
 our textbooks might be very different than they are now i mean

Speaker 0 :could i ask you to speculate where do
 you think free will could be squeezed into there like what'sthat even
 um is it is it possible that our brain just creates kinds ofillusions that are useful for us or like
 what where where could it possibly be

Speaker 1 :squeezed in well
 let me let me give a speculation and answer to your very nicequestion but but you know don't and the
 listeners podcast don't quote me on this i'm not saying this is what i believe tobe true but let me just give an example
 i gave this the end of my book incognito so thewhole book of incognito is about you
 know all the what's happening in the brain and essentially i'm saying lookhere's all the
 reasons to think that free will probably does not exist but at the very end i saylook imagine that you are
 um you know imagine that you're a kalahari bushmanand you find a radio in the sand and
 you've never seen anything like this and you you look at this radio and andyou realize that when you turn this knob
 you hear voices coming from their voices coming from itso being a you know a radio materialist
 you try to figure out like how does thisthing operate so you take off the back
 cover and you realize there's all these wiresand when you take out some wires
 the voices get garbled or stop or whatever and so what you end updeveloping is a whole theory about
 how this connections pattern of wires gives rise to voicesbut it would never strike you that in
 distant cities there's a radio tower and there's invisible stuff beamingand that's actually the origin of the
 voices and this is just necessary for it so i mentioned this just as aspeculation saying look
 how would we know what we know about the brain for absolutely certain is that ifwhen you damage pieces and parts of it
 things get jumbled up but how would you know if there's something else going onthat we can't see like electromagnetic
 radiation that is what's actually generating this

Speaker 0 :yeah
 you paint a beautiful example of uh of how totally because we don't knowmost of how our universe works how
 totally off-base we might be with our science yeahuntil i mean we i mean um yeah i mean
 that's inspiring that's beautiful it's kind ofterrifying
 it's humbling it's all all of the above

Speaker 1 :and the important and the important part
 just to recognize is that of course we're in the position of havingmassive unknowns and you know
 we have of course the known unknowns and that's all the things we're pursuing inour labs and trying to figure out that
 but there's this whole space of unknown unknowns things wehaven't even realized we haven't asked
 yet

Speaker 0 :let me kind of ask a weird maybe a
 difficult question part of the it has to do with i've beenrecently reading a lot about world war
 ii i'm currently reading a book i recommend for people which isuh uh as a jew it's been difficult to
 read but uh the horizon follows the third reichso let me just ask about like the nature
 of genius the nature of evil if we look atsomebody like
 uh einstein we look at hitler stalin modern day jeffrey epsteinjust folks who through their life have
 done with einstein done works of genius andwith the others i mentioned have done
 evil on this world what do we think about that in a livewired brain
 like how do how do we think about these extreme

Speaker 1 :people here's here's what i'd say this
 is a very big and difficult question but what i would say briefly on itis um you know first of all
 i saw a cover of time magazines some years agouh and it was a big you know sagittal
 slice of the brain and it said something likeum what makes us good and evil and there
 was a little spot pointing to it there's a picture of gandhi and there's a littlespot that was pointing to hitler
 and these time magazine covers always make me mad becauseit's so goofy to think that we're going
 to find some spot in the brain or somethinginstead the interesting part is
 because we're live-wired we are all about the world and the culturearound us
 so somebody like adolf hitler got all this positive feedback about whatwas going on
 and the crazier and crazier the ideas he had he's like let's set updeath camps and murder a bunch of people
 and so on somehow he was getting positive feedbackfrom that
 and all these other people they're all you know spun each other up and you lookat anything like
 i mean look at the you know um the the cultural uh revolution in china or theum you know the russian revolution or
 things like this where you look at these thingsmy god how do people all behave like
 this but it's easy to see groups of people spinning themselves upin particular ways where they all say
 well would i have thought this was right in adifferent circumstance i don't know but
 fred thinks it's right and steve thinks everyone around you seems to think it'sright and so um
 part of the maybe downside of having a live wired brain is that you can getcrowds of people doing things
 um as a group so it's interesting to you know we would pinpoint hitlersaying that's the evil guy but in a
 sense i think it was tolstoy you said the theking becomes um slave
 to the to the people in other words you know hitler was just arepresentation of whatever was going on
 with that huge crowd that he was surrounded withso
 um so i only bring that up to say that it's you know it'svery difficult to say what it is about
 this person's brain or that person's brain he obviously gotfeedback for what he was doing the other
 thing by the way about what we often think of as beingevil in society
 is um my lab recently published some work on in groups and out groupswhich is a very important
 part of this puzzle so it turns out that we are verywe are very you know engineered
 to care about in-groups versus out-groups and this seems to be like areally fundamental thing
 so we did this experiment lab where we brought people in we stick them in thescanner
 and we i don't know it's something if you know this but uh we show them on thehand
 sorry we showed them on the screen six hands and uh the computer boopgoes around randomly picks a hand and
 then you see that hand gets stabbed with a syringe needle so you actually see asyringe needle enter the hand
 and come out and it's really uh what that does is that triggersuh parts of the pain matrix this areas
 in your brain that involved in feeling physical pain now the interesting thingis it's not your hand that was stabbed
 so what you're seeing is is empathy this is you seeing someone else's hand getstabbed you feel like oh god this is
 awful right okay um we contrast that by the way with somebody's hand gettingpoked as a
 q-tip which is you know looks visually the same but it's umyou don't have that same level of
 response now what we do is we label each hand with awith a one word label christian jewish
 muslim atheist scientologist hindu and nowthe computer goes around picks a hand
 stabs the hand and the question is how much does your brain care about allthe people in your out group versus the
 one label that happens to match you and it turns out for everybodyacross all religions
 they care much more about their in group than their accurate and when i say theycare what i mean is
 you get a bigger response from their brain everything's the same it's thesame
 hands it's just a one-word label you care much more about your in-groupthan your outgroup and i wish this
 weren't true but this is how humans are

Speaker 0 :i wonder how fundamental that is or if
 it's a it's the emergent thing about culturelike if we lived alone with like if it's
 genetically built into the brain like thisthis longing for tribe so i'll so i'll


Speaker 1 :tell you we addressed that so here's
 what we did there are two [Music]actually there are two other things we
 did as part of this study that i think matter for this pointone is so okay so we show that you have
 a much bigger response by the way this is not a cognitive thing it's a very lowlevel
 basic response to seeing pain in somebody okay great study by the way

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :thanks thanks what we did next is
 we we next have it where we say okay the year is 2025and these three religions are now in a
 war against these three religions and it's all randomized right but what yousee is your thing
 and you have two allies now against these othersand now it happens over the course of
 many trials you see everybody gets stabbed at different timesand the question is do you care more
 about your allies and the answer is yes suddenlypeople who a moment ago you didn't
 really care when they got stabbed now simply with this one word thing thatyou're they're now your allies you care
 more about them but then what i wanted to do was look athow ingrained is this or how arbitrary
 is it so we brought new participants in and we said here's acoin toss the coin if it's heads you're
 an augustinian if it's a tails you're a justinianthese are totally made up okay so they
 toss it they get whatever we give them a a banthat says you know augustinian on it
 whatever tribe they're in now um and they get in the scanner and theysee a thing on the screen that says the
 augustinians and justinians are two warring tribes then you see a bunch ofhands some are labeled augustine some
 are justinian and now you care more about whicheverteam you're on than the other team even
 though it's totally after and you know is arbitrary because you're the one totoss the coin
 yeah so it's it it's a state that's very easy to find ourselves in in other wordsjust before walking in the door they'd
 never even heard of augustinian versus justinian and nowtheir brain is representing it simply
 because they're told they're on this team

Speaker 0 :you know uh now i did my own personal
 study of this uh it's uhso once you're an augustinian that tends
 to be sticky because i've been a packers fan uh going back pakistan my whole lifenow when i'm in boston with like the the
 patriots it's been tough going for my livewirebrain to switch to the patriots
 to be so once you become it's it's interesting oncethe tribe is sticky yeah oh but that's


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :true
 that's that's it you know you know we

Speaker 1 :never tried that about saying okay now
 you're adjusting the enemy we're in august howsticky it is but there are studies of
 this of monkey troops uh on someisland um and
 what happens is they look at the way monkeys behave when they're part of thistribe and how they treat members of the
 other tribe of monkeys and then what they do i forgotten howthey do that exactly but they end up
 switching a monkey so he ends up in the other troop and very quickly they end upbecoming a part of that other troop and
 and hating and behaving badly towards their original troop

Speaker 0 :these are fascinating studies by the way
 yeah this is this is beautiful uh in your in your book youhave uh
 you have a good light bulb joke uh how many psychiatrists does it take tochange a light bulb
 only one but the light bulb has to want to changei'm sorry i'm a sucker for a good light
 bulb okay so given uh you know i've beeninterested in psychiatry
 uh my whole life just maybe tangentially i've kind ofearly on dream to be a psychiatrist
 until i understood what it entails uh but you know what umyou know is there hope for psychiatry
 for somebody else to help this live wired brain to adjust

Speaker 1 :oh yeah i mean in the sense that and
 this has to do with this issue about us being trapped on our own planetforget psychiatrists just think of like
 when you're talking with a friend and you say oh i'm so upset about thisand your friend says hey just look at it
 this way uh you know all we have access to undernormal circumstances is just the way
 we're seeing something and so it's super helpful to have friends andcommunities and psychiatrists and so on
 to help things change that way so that'sjust like interesting of help to us but
 but more importantly the role that psychiatrists have played is thatthere's this sort of naive assumption
 that we all come to the table with which is that everyone is fundamentally justlike us and when you're a kid you you
 believe this entirely but as you get older and you start realizing okaythere's something called schizophrenia
 and that's a real thing and to be inside that person's headis totally different than what it is to
 be inside my head or their psychopathy and and to be insidethis psychopath's head he doesn't care
 about other people he doesn't care about hurting other people he's just doingwhat he needs to do to get what he needs
 um that's a different head there's a million different things going onand it is different to be inside those
 heads that this is where the field ofpsychiatry comes in now
 i think it's an interesting question about the degree to whichis leaking into and taking over
 psychiatry and what the landscape will look like 50years from now it may be that
 psychiatry as a profession you know changes a lot or maybe goesaway entirely and neuroscience will
 essentially be able to take over some of thesefunctions but it has been extremely
 useful to understand the differences betweenhow people behave and why and what you
 can tell about what's going on inside their brainjust based on observation of their
 behavior

Speaker 0 :you uh this this might be years ago
 but i'm not sure there's an atlantic article you've writtenabout moving away from a distinction
 between neurological disorders unquote brain problems and psychiatricdisorders
 or quote unquote mind problems so so on that topic how do you think aboutthis gray area yeah this is exactly this


Speaker 1 :is exactly the evolution that things are
 going is you know there was psychiatry and then there were guysand gals in labs poking cells and so on
 those are the neurosciences but yeah i think these are movingtogether for exactly the reason you
 decided and where this matters a lot theatlantic article
 uh that i wrote was called the brain on trialwhere this matters a lot is it's the
 legal system because the way we run our legal system now andthis is true everywhere in the world is
 you know someone shows up in front of the judge's bench or let's say there'sfive people in front of the judge's
 bench and they've all committed the same crime what we dobecause we feel like hey this is fair is
 alright you're gonna get the same sentence you'll all get three years inprison or whatever it is
 but in fact brains can be so different this guy's got schizophrenia this guy'sa psychopath this guy's tweaked down on
 drugs and so on so that um it actually doesn't make senseto keep doing that and what we what we
 do in this country more than anywhere inthe world is we
 imagine that incarceration is a one-size-fits-all solution and you mayknow we have the
 america has the highest incarceration rate in the whole world in terms of thepercentage of our population we put
 behind bars so um there's a much more refined thingwe can do
 as neuroscience comes in and changes and has the opportunity to change the legalsystem
 which is to say this doesn't let anybody off the hook it doesn't say oh it's notyour fault and so on
 but what it does is it changes the equation so it's not abouthey how blameworthy are you but instead
 is about hey what do we do from here what's thebest thing to do from here so if you
 take somebody with schizophrenia and you have thembreak rocks in the hot summer sun in a
 chain gang all yeah that that doesn't help theschizophrenia that doesn't fix the
 problem um if you take somebody with a drugaddiction who's in jail for you know
 being caught two ounces of some illegal substanceand you put him in prison it doesn't
 actually fix the addiction it doesn't help anythinghappily what neuroscience and psychiatry
 bring to the table is lots of really useful things you cando with schizophrenia with drug
 addiction things like this um and that's why so i i don't know ifhe knows but i run a national non-profit
 called the center for science and law and it's all about this intersection ofneuroscience and legal system
 and we're trying to implement changes in every county and every stateum i'll just without going down that
 rabbit hole i'll just say one of the very simplest things to do is to set upspecialized court systems where you have
 a mental health court that has judges andjuries with
 expertise in mental illness because if you go by the way to a regular court andthe person says
 um or the the defense lawyer says this person is schizophreniamost of the jury will say man i call
 [ __ ] on that why because they don't know about becausethey don't they don't
 know what it's about and it turns out people whowho know about schizophrenia feel very
 differently as a juror than someone who happens not to know anybodyschizophrenia they think it's an excuse
 so um you have judge injuries withexpertise in mental illness and they
 know the rehabilitative strategies that are availablethat's one thing having a drug court
 where you have judges and jurors with expertise and rehabilitative strategiesand what can be done and so on a
 specialized prostitution core and so on all these different uh thingsby the way this is very easy for
 counties to implement this sort of thing and this is this is i think where thismatters to get
 neuroscience into public policy what's

Speaker 0 :the process of
 injecting expertise into this so yeah

Speaker 1 :i'll tell you exactly what it is
 a county needs to run out of money first i've seen this happen over and overso what happens is a county has a
 completely full jail and they say you know whatwe need to build another jail and then
 they realize god we don't have any money we can't affordthis we've got too many people in jail
 and that's when they turn to god we need something smarter and that'swhen they set up specialized court
 systems

Speaker 0 :oh we all function best when when our
 back is against the wall

Speaker 1 :and that's what kovit is good for yeah
 it's because we we've all had our routines and we areoptimized for the things we do and
 suddenly our backs are against the wall all of us

Speaker 0 :yeah it's really i mean one of the
 exciting things about uh kovet i mean i'm a big believer inthe the possibility of what government
 can do for the people and uh when it becomes too big of a bureaucracyit starts functioning poorly starts
 wasting money it's nice to uh i mean covers andreveals that nicely and lessons to be
 learned about who gets elected and who goes intogovernment
 hopefully this hopefully this inspires talented and young people to go intogovernment to revolutionize different
 aspects of it yeah so it's uh this that's the positivesilver lining of
 of covid i mean i thought it'd be fun to ask youi don't know if you're paying attention
 to machine learning world and gpt3 so the gpt3 is this language model thisneural network that's able to uh
 it has 175 billion parameters so it's very large and it's trained inan unsupervised
 way on the internet it just reads a lot ofunstructured text and it's able to
 generate some pretty impressive things the human brain compared to that hasabout you know
 a thousand times more synapses people get so upset when machinelearning people
 compare the brain and we know synapses are different it was very

Speaker 1 :different very different


Speaker 0 :right but like do you um what do you
 think about gpt3

Speaker 1 :here's what i think here's what i think
 a few things what gpt 3 is doing is extremely impressive but it's verydifferent from what the brain does so
 um it's a good impersonator but just as one exampleeverybody takes a passage that gpt
 three has has written and they say wow look at this and it's pretty good rightbut it's already gone through a
 filtering process of humans looking at it and saying okay well that's crapthat's correct okay oh here's
 here's a sentence that's pretty cool now here's the thinghuman creativity is about absorbing
 everything around it and remixing that and coming up with stuff so in thatsense we're sort of like gpt3 you know
 we're we're remixing what we've gotten inbefore
 but we also know we also have very good models of what it is to be another humanand so um you know i don't know if you
 speak uh french or something but i'm not gonna start speaking in french becausethen you'll say
 wait what are you doing i don't understand it instead everything comingout of my mouth is meant for your ears i
 know what you'll understand i know thevocabulary that you know and don't know
 i know what parts you care about that's a huge part of it and so of allthe possible sentences i could say
 i'm navigating this thin bandwidth so that it's something useful for ourconversation yeah in real time but also


Speaker 0 :throughout your life i mean you're
 you're coval we're co-evolving together we're learning exactly how to uhcommunicate together exactly but this is


Speaker 1 :this is what gpt
 does not do all it's doing is saying okay i'm gonna take all these sensesand remix stuff and pop some stuff out
 but it doesn't know how to make it so that you lex will feellike oh yeah that's exactly what i
 needed to hear um that's the next sentence that ineeded to know about for something


Speaker 0 :well of course it could be all the
 impressive results we'll see the question is when if you raise the numberof parameters
 whether it's going to be after something

Speaker 1 :it will not be
 it will not be no raising more parameters won'there's the thing it's not that i don't
 think neural networks can't be like the human brain as i suspect they will be atsome point 50 years you know who knows
 but what we are missing in artificial neural networks is we'vegot this basic structure
 where you've got units and you've got synapses they're connectedand and that's great and it's done
 incredibly mind-blowing impressive things butit's not doing the same algorithms as a
 human brain so when i look at my children as littlekids
 as infants they can do things that no gpt3 can dothey can navigate a complex room they
 can navigate social conversation with anadult
 um they can lie they can do a million thingsthey they are active thinkers in our
 world and doing things and this of course i mean look wetotally agree on in how incredibly
 awesome artificial neural networks are right now but we also know the thingsthat they can't
 do well like you know like be generally intelligent do all these different

Speaker 0 :reasons reason about the world
 efficiently learn efficiently adapt exactly but it's still the rate ofimprovement
 it's uh to me it's it's possible they'll be surprised

Speaker 1 :like that but what i would
 what i would assert and then and i'm glad i'm going to say this on yourpodcast so we can look back at this in
 two years and 10 years is that we've got to be much moresophisticated than
 units and synapses between them let me give you an example and this issomething i talk about in livewire
 is despite the amazing impressiveness mind-blowing impressivenessum computers don't have some basic
 things artificial neural networks don't have some basicthings that we like caring about
 relevance for example so as humans we are confronted with tons ofdata all the time and we only encode
 particular things that are relevant to us we have thisvery
 deep sense of relevance that i mentioned earlier is based on survival at the mostbasic level but then
 all the things about my life and your lifewhat's relevant to you that we encode um
 this is very useful computers at the moment don't have that they don't have ayen to survive and things like that so


Speaker 0 :we filter out a bunch of the junk we
 don't need we're really good at efficiently zoominginto the things we need
 again could be argued you know let me put on my freud hatmaybe it's uh i mean that's our
 conscious mind uh you know we're not you know there's noreason that neural networks aren't doing
 the same kind of filtration i mean in the sense what gpt3 is doingso there's a priming
 step it's doing an essential kind of filtration when youask it to generate tweets from
 from i don't know from from an elon musk or something like that it's doinga filtration of it's throwing away all
 the parameters it doesn't need for this taskand it's figuring out how to do that
 successfully and then ultimately it's not doing a very goodjob right now but it's doing a lot
 better job than we expected

Speaker 1 :but it won't ever do a really good job
 and i'll tell you why i mean so so let's say we say hey produce an elonmusk tweet and we see like oh wow it
 produced these three that's great but againit's not we're not seeing the three
 thousand that produce that didn't really make any senseit's because it has no idea what it is
 like to be a human and all the things that you might wantto say and all the reasons you wouldn't
 like when you go to write a tweet you might write something yeah it's notgoing to come off quite right in this
 modern political climate or whatever like you know you can change things

Speaker 0 :so and it somehow boils down to fear and
 mortality and all of these human things at the end ofthe day all contained with that tweeting
 experience

Speaker 1 :well interestingly the fear of mortality
 is at the bottom of this but you've got all these more things like you knowoh i want to just in case the chairman
 of my department reads this i wanted to come off therejust in case my mom looks at this tweet
 i want to make sure she you know and so on so that those are all the

Speaker 0 :things that humans are able to
 sort of throw into the calculation but i meanuh what it required what it requires


Speaker 1 :though is having a model
 of your chairman having a model of your mother having a model of theyou know the person you want to go on a
 date with who might look at your tweet and so onall these things are uh you're running
 the reason about what it is like to be them

Speaker 0 :so in terms of the structure of the
 brain again this may be going into speculationland i hope you
 go along with me is uh okay so the brain seems to beintelligent
 and our ai systems aren't very currently so where do you think intelligencearises in the brain
 like what what is it about the brain so

Speaker 1 :if you mean where location wise it's no
 single spot it would be equivalent to askingi'm looking at new york city where
 is the economy the answer is you can't point to anywhere the economy is allabout the interaction of
 all of the pieces and parts of the city and that's what you know intelligencewhatever we mean by that in the brain is
 interacting from everything going on at once in terms of

Speaker 0 :a structure so we look humans are much
 smarter than fish maybe not dolphins butdolphins are mammals right but i assert


Speaker 1 :that what we mean by smarter has to do
 with live wiring so so what we mean when we say oh we'resmarter is oh you can figure out a new
 thing and figure out a new pathway to get where we need to goand that's because fish are essentially
 coming to the table with you know okay here's the hardwarego swim mate eat but we
 have the capacity to say okay look i'm gonna absorb oh oh but you know i sawsomeone else do this thing and
 and i read once that you could do this other thing and so on so do you think

Speaker 0 :there's
 is there something i know the these are mysteries butlike architecturally speaking what
 feature of the brain of uh of the live wire aspect of itthat is really useful for intelligence
 so like is it the ability of neurons to reconnectlike is there something is there any
 lessons about the human brain you think might be inspiring for us andto take into the artificial into the
 machine learning

Speaker 1 :world yeah i'm actually just trying to
 write some up on this now called you know if you want to build a robotstart with the stomach and what i mean
 by that what i mean by that is a robot has to care it has to havehunger it has to care about surviving
 that kind of thing here's an example so the penultimate chapter in my bookum i titled the the wolf in the mars
 rover and i just look at this simple comparison ofyou look at a wolf
 it gets its leg caught in a trap what does it do it gnawsits leg off and then it figures out how
 to walk on three legs no problem now the mars rover curiositygot its front wheel stuck in some
 martian soil and it died this project that costbillions of dollars died because guys
 wheels so wouldn't it be terrific if we could build a robot thatchewed off its front wheel
 and figured out how to operate with a slightly different body planthat's the kind of thing that we want to
 be able to build and to get there what we need the whole reason the wolfis able to do that is because
 its motor and somatosensory systems are live wired so it says oh you know whatturns out i've got a body plan that's
 different than what i thought a few minutes agobut i i have a yen to survive
 and i care about relevance which in this case is getting to food getting back tomy pack and so on
 so i'm just gonna figure out how to operate with this oh oops that didn'twork
 oh okay i'm kind of getting it to work but the mars rover doesn't do that itjust says oh geez i was pre-programmed
 to have four wheels and i have three i'm screwed

Speaker 0 :yeah you know i i don't know if you're
 familiar with a philosopher named ernest becker he wrote a book calleddenial of death
 and there's a few psychologists sheldon solomon i think he i justspoke with him on his podcast who
 developed terror management theory which is uhlike ernest becker is a philosopher that
 basically said that uh mortality fear of mortality is at thecore of it yeah
 and so i i don't know if it sounds compelling as an ideathat we're all i mean that all of the
 civilization we've constructed is based on this but it's i'm familiar

Speaker 1 :with his work
 here's what i think i think that yes fundamentallythis desire to survive is at the core of
 it i would agree with that but but how that expresses itself inyour life
 it ends up being very different the reason you do what you dois i mean you could list the 100 reasons
 why you chose to write your tweet this way and that wayand it really has nothing to do with the
 survival part it has to do with you know trying to impress fellow humans andsurprise them and say something


Speaker 0 :yeah so many things built on top of each
 other but it's it's fascinating to think thatin artificial intelligence systems we
 want to be able to somehow engineer this drive for survival forimmortality i mean because as humans
 we're not just about survival we're aware of the factthat we're going to die
 which is a very kind of where we're like space-time

Speaker 1 :by the way aren't all right confucius
 said uh he said each personhas two lives the second one begins when
 you realize that you have just one yeah but but most people it takes a longtime for most people to get there


Speaker 0 :i mean you could argue this kind of
 freudian thing which ernest becker uh argues is they it's theythey actually figured it out early on
 and the terror they felt was like the reasonit's been suppressed and the reason most
 people when i ask them about whether they're afraid of death they basicallysay no
 they basically say like um i'm afraid i won't getlike submit the paper before i die like
 they kind of see they see death as a kind of uhinconvenient deadline for a particular
 set of like a book you're writing yeah it's asopposed to like
 what the hell this thing ends this at any moment like most people as if ihave encountered do not meditate on the
 idea that like right now you could die like right nowlike it it's like it in in the next five
 minutes it could be all over and you know meditate on that ideai think that somehow brings you closer
 to like the core of the motivations andthe core of the human cognition
 condition

Speaker 1 :but like i said it is not
 yeah there's so many things on top of it but it is interesting i meanas the ancient poet said uh death
 whispers at my ear live for i come so it'sit is certainly motivating when we think
 about that okay i've got some deadline i don't knowexactly what it is but i better make
 stuff happen it is motivating but i don'tthink uh i mean i know for just
 speaking for me personally that's not what motivates me day to day it'sinstead
 oh i want to get this you know program up and running before this or iwant to make sure my co-author isn't mad
 at me because i haven't gotten this in there i don't want to miss this grantdeadline or
 you know whatever the thing is yeah it's

Speaker 0 :too it's too distant in a sense
 nevertheless it is good to reconnect but for the ai systemsnone of that is there uh like a neural
 network does not fear it's mortality uh and that that seems to be somehowfundamentally missing the point


Speaker 1 :i think that's missing the point but i
 wonder it's an interesting speculation about whether you can build an ai systemthat is much closer to being a human
 without the mortality and survival piece but just the thing ofrelevance just i care about this versus
 that right now if you have a robot roll into the roomit's going to be frozen because it
 doesn't have any reason to go there versus there it doesn't have anyparticular
 set of things about this is how i should navigate my nextmove because i want
 something yeah there's a that's the

Speaker 0 :thing about humans
 is they seem to generate goals they're likeyou said live wired i mean it it's very
 flexible in terms of the goals and creative in terms of the goals yougenerate when we enter a room
 you show up to a party without a goal usuallyand then you figure it out alone yes but


Speaker 1 :this goes back to the question about
 free will which is when i walk into the partyif you rewound it 10 000 times would i
 go and talk to that couple over there versus that person likei might do this exact same thing every
 time because i've got some goal stack and i think okay well at this party ireally want to meet
 these kind of people or i feel awkward or i whatever you know whatever my goalsare
 by the way so there was something that i meant to mention earlierif you don't mind going back which is
 this when we were talking about bci um so i don't know if you know this butwhat i'm spending ninety percent of my
 time doing now is running a company do you know about this yes i wasn't sure

Speaker 0 :what the company
 is involved in right so talk about it

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah
 so when it comes to the future of bci um you know you can put stuff into thebrain
 invasively but my interest has been how you can get data streams into thebrain non-invasively so i run a company
 called neosensory and what we build is this little umwristband we've built this in many
 different oh wow that's it yeah this is it and it's gotthese vibratory motors in it
 so these things as i'm speaking for example it'syou know capturing my voice and running
 algorithms and then turning that into patterns of vibration hereso people who are deaf for example
 learn to hear through their skin so the information is getting up to their brainthis way
 and they learn how to hear so it turns out on day one people are pretty goodlike better than you would expect at
 being able to say oh that's weird it was that was that adog barking was that a baby crying was
 that a door knock a doorbell like people are pretty good at it butwith time they get better and better
 and what it becomes is a new qualia in other words a new subjective internalexperience
 so on day one they they say whoa what was thatoh oh that was the dog barking but by
 you know three months later they say oh there'sdog barking somewhere oh there's the dog
 that's fascinating and by the way that's exactly how you learn how to use yourears
 so what you of course need to remember this but when you're an infant all youhave are you know your eardrum vibrating
 causes spikes to go down your auditory nerves and impinging youryou know auditory cortex your brain
 doesn't know what those mean automatically but what happens is youlearn how to hear by looking for
 correlations you know you clap your hands as a babyyou know you look at your mother's mouth
 moving and and that correlates with what's going on thereand eventually your brain says i'm just
 going to summarize this as an internal experience as a consciousexperience and that's exactly what
 happens here the weird part is that you can feed datainto the brain
 not through the ears but through any channel that gets there as long as theinformation gets there your brain
 figures out what to do with it that's

Speaker 0 :fascinating
 like expanding the set of sensors it could be could be arbitrarily uhcould could it could yeah it could
 expand arbitrarily which is fascinating well exactly and by the way

Speaker 1 :the reason i use this skin you know
 there's all kinds of cool stuff going on in the ar worldclass but the fact is your eyes are
 overtaxed and your ears are overtaxed and you need to be able to see and hearother stuff
 but you're covered with the skin which is this incredible computationalmaterial
 with which you can feed information and we don't use our skin for much ofanything nowadays
 um my joke in the lab is that i say we don't call this the waste for nothingbecause originally we built as the vest
 and you know you're passing in all this informationum that way and um
 what i'm doing here with with the deaf communityis is what's called sensory substitution
 where i'm capturing sound and scent you know i'm just replacing the ears withthe skin
 and that works um one of the things i talk about in livewire is sensoryexpansion so what if you took something
 like your your visual system which picks up on a very thinslice of the electromagnetic spectrum
 and you could see infrared or ultraviolet so we've hooked that upinfrared and ultraviolet detectors
 and you know i can feel what's going on so just as an example the first night ibuilt the infrared
 one of my engineers built at the infrared detector i was walking in thedark between two houses and suddenly i
 felt all this infrared radiation i was likewhere does that come from and i just
 followed my wrist and i found a um an infrared camera a night visioncamera that was
 but like you know i immediately oh there there's that thing there butof course i would have never seen it but
 now it's just part of my reality that's fascinating yeah and thenof course what i'm really interested in
 is sensory addition what if you could pick up onstuff that
 isn't even part of what we normally pick up on like you know like the magneticfield of the earth or
 twitter or stock market or things like

Speaker 0 :that or the i don't know some weird
 stuff like the moods of other people or something like that surenow what you need is a way to measure


Speaker 1 :that so as long as there's a machine
 that can measure it it's easy it's trivial to feed this in here and youcome to be
 it comes to be part of your reality it's like you have another sensor

Speaker 0 :and that that kind of thing is without
 doing like if you look in your link withouti forgot how you put it but it was
 eloquent you know without getting cutting into the brain basically yeah

Speaker 1 :exactly exactly so this this
 costs at the moment 399 dollars that's not going to kill youand yeah it's not going to kill you it's
 you just put it on and when you're done you take it off yeahum yeah and so uh and the name of the
 company by the way is neo sensory for newsenses because the whole idea is
 beautiful you can as i said you know you come to the tablewith certain plug and play devices and
 then that's it like i can pick up on this little bit of the electromagneticradiation you can pick up on
 on this little frequency band for hearing and so onbut but but i'm stuck there and there's
 no reason we have to be stuck there we can expand our oom veltby adding new senses yeah what's um oh
 i'm sorry the umvelt is the slice of reality that you pick upon so each animal has its own
 hell of a word umvelt yeah exactly so i'm sorry i forgot to define itbefore it's it's it's such an important
 concept which is to say um for example if you are a a tickyou pick up on uh butyric acid you pick
 up on odor and you pick up on temperature that's itthat's how you construct your reality is
 with those two sensors if you are a blind echolocating bat you're picking upon
 air compression waves coming back you know echolocation if you arethe black ghost knife fish you're
 picking up on changes in the electrical field around youwith electro reception that's how they
 swim around and tell there's a rock there and so onbut but that's that's all they pick up
 on that's their umvelt it's that's their the signals they getfrom the world from which to construct
 their reality and they can be totally different ooh beltsand so our human umvelt is
 you know we've got little bits that we can pick up on one of the things i liketo do with my students is talk about
 um imagine that you are a bloodhound dog right you are a blendhead dog with ahuge snout with 200 million scent
 receptors in it and your whole world is about smellingyou know you've got slits in your
 nostrils like big nose fulls of air and so ondo you have a dog do you nope you used
 to used to okay so you know you walk your dog around and your dog is smellingeverything
 the whole world is full of signals that you do not pick up on it so imagine ifyou were that dog and you looked at your
 human master and thought my god what is it like to have the pitiful little noseof a human yeah
 how could you not know that there's a cat 100 yards away or that your friendwas here six hours ago
 and so the idea is because we're stuck in our own belt because we have thislittle pitiful noses we think
 okay well yeah we're seeing reality but but you can have very different sorts ofrealities depending on the
 peripheral plug-and-play devices you're equipped with it's fascinating to think

Speaker 0 :that like
 if we're being honest probably our own belt isuh you know some infinitely tiny
 percent of the possibilities of how you can sensequote unquote reality even if you could
 i mean there's a guy named don uh donald uh hoffman yeahwho based basically says uh we're really
 far away from reality in terms of our ability to senseanything like we
 we're very we're almost like we're floating out therethat's almost like completely attached
 to the actual physical reality it's fascinating that we could haveextra senses that
 could help us get a little bit a little bit closer exactly and by the way this

Speaker 1 :has been the
 the fruits of science is realizing like for example you know you open your eyesand there's the world around you right
 but of course depending on how you calculateit it's less than a 10 trillion
 of the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible lightuh the reason i say it depends because
 you know it's actually infinite in all directions

Speaker 0 :yeah and so that's exactly that and then
 science allows you to actually look into the rest of it

Speaker 1 :exactly start understanding how big the


Speaker 0 :world is out there and the same with the
 the world of really small and the world of really large exactlythat's beyond our ability to sense
 exactly and so the reason i think this

Speaker 1 :kind of thing matters is because
 we now have an opportunity for that first time in human historyto say okay well i'm just going to
 include other things in my umvelt so i'm going to include infrared radiationand and have a direct perceptual
 experience of that and so i'm very you know i mean so youknow i've given up my lab and i run this
 company 90 of my time now that's what i'm doing istill teach at stanford and i'm you know
 teaching courses and stuff like that but this is like

Speaker 0 :this is your your passion
 the fire is as on this yeah i feel like this is

Speaker 1 :the most important thing that's
 happening right now i mean obviously i think that because that'swhat i'm devoting my time and my life to
 but

Speaker 0 :i mean it's a brilliant set of ideas it
 certainly is like it uh it's a step in uh in a veryvibrant future i would say like that the
 possibilities there are are endless exactly so if you ask

Speaker 1 :what i think about neural link
 i think it's amazing what those guys are doing and working on but i think it'snot practical for almost everybody for
 example for people who are deaf they buy thisand you know every day we're getting
 tons of emails and tweets or whatever from people saying wow i picked up onthis and then i had no idea that was a
 i didn't even know that was happening out there yeah they're coming to heredude by the way this is you know less
 than a tenth of the price of a hearing aid andlike 250 times less than a cochlear
 implant

Speaker 0 :that's amazing uh people love hearing
 about uh what you know brilliant folks likeyourself
 uh could recommend in terms of books of course you're an author of many booksso i'll in the introduction mention all
 the books you've written people should definitely read live wiredi've gotten a chance to read some of it
 it's amazing but is there three books technicalfiction
 philosophical that had an impact on you when you were younger or today andbooks perhaps some of which you would uh
 want to recommend that others read

Speaker 1 :ah you know as an undergraduate i
 majored in british american literature that was mymajor because i loved literature i grew
 up with literature my father had these extensivebookshelves and so
 i grew up in the mountains in new mexico and so that was mostly where i spent mytime was reading books but
 um you know i love uh you know faulkner hemingway i love manysouth american authors
 gabriel garcia marquez and italo calvina i would actually recommend invisiblecities i just i
 loved that book by italo calvino sorry it's a book of fiction um uhanthony door wrote a book called all the
 light we cannot see which actually uh was inspired byincognito by
 exactly what we were talking about earlier about how you can only see alittle bit of
 the what we call visible light in the electromagnetic radiationi wrote about this in incognito and then
 he reviewed incognito for the washington oh nothat's awesome and then he wrote this
 book the book has nothing to do with that but that's where the title comesfrom
 yeah all the light we cannot see is about the rest of the spectrum butum the that's a absolutely gorgeous book
 jesus

Speaker 0 :that's the book of fiction yeah it's a


Speaker 1 :book of fiction


Speaker 0 :what's it about it takes place during


Speaker 1 :world war ii uh about these two young
 people one of whom is blind

Speaker 0 :and yeah anything else so
 any so you mentioned hemingway i mean uh old man the seawhat uh what's your favorite uh um snows


Speaker 1 :of kilimanjaro
 uh oh wow short stories that i love um as far as not as far as nonfiction goesi grew up uh with cosmos both watching
 the pbs series and then reading the book andthat influenced me a huge amount in
 terms of what i do i as from the time i was a kid i feltlike i want to be
 carl sagan like i just that's what i loved and in the end ijust you know i studied space physics
 for a while as an undergrad but then i in my last semesterdiscovered neuroscience
 last semester and i just thought well i'm hooked on that so

Speaker 0 :the carl sagan of the brain is the
 aspiration yeah i mean uh you're doing you're doingum
 an incredible job of it so you open the book livewire with a quote byheidegger every man is born as many men
 and dies as a single one well what do you mean or what i'll tell

Speaker 1 :you what i meant by it yeah i'll tell
 you so he he had his own reason why he was writingthat but i meant this in terms of brain
 plasticity in terms of the library which is this issue that i mentionedbefore about this yeah this cone the
 space time cone that we are in which is that when you droppedinto the world
 you lex had all this different potential you could have been a greatsurfer or a great chess player or you
 could have been thousands of different men when you grewup but what you did is
 things that were not your choice and your choice along the way you know youended up navigating a particular path
 and now you're exactly who you are you still have lots of potential but the dayyou die
 you will be exactly lex you will be one person yeah so on that in that

Speaker 0 :context i mean
 first of all it's just a beautiful it's a humbling picturebut it's a beautiful one because that's
 uh all the possible trajectories and you pick one you walk downthat road it's the robert frost poem but
 on that topic let me ask the the biggest and the most ridiculousquestion
 so in this live wide brain when we choose all these different trajectoriesand end up with one what's the meaning
 of it all what's uh is there is there a why here what's themeaning of life
 yeah david engelman that's it

Speaker 1 :i mean this is the question that
 everyone has attacked from their own lifewire point of view by which i meanculturally if you grow up in a religious
 society you have one way of attacking thatquestions on if you grow up in a secular
 scientific society you have a different way of attacking that questionobviously i i don't know i abstain on
 that question

Speaker 0 :i mean i think one of the fundamental
 things i guess in that in all those possible trajectories is uhyou're always asking
 i mean that's the act of asking what the heck is this thingfor is equivalent to
 or at least runs in parallel to all the choices that you're makingbecause it's kind of that's the
 underlying question well that's right

Speaker 1 :and by the way
 you know this is the interesting thing about human psychology we've got allthese
 layers of things at which we can ask questions and so if you keep askingyourself the question about
 what is the optimal way for me to be spending my time what should i be doingwhat charity should i get involved with
 and so on if you're asking those big questionsthat that steers you appropriately if
 you're the type person who never asks hey is there something better icould be doing with my time then
 presumably you won't optimize whatever it is that is important to youso you've


Speaker 0 :uh i think just in your eyes
 in your work there's a passion uh that just is obvious and it's inspiringit's contagious
 what um if you were to give advice to us a young person today in the crazychaos that we live today
 about life about how to how to uh how to discover their passionis there some words that you could give


Speaker 1 :first of all i would say the main thing
 for a young person is stay adaptable and and this is back tothis issue of why
 covet is useful for us because it forces us off our tracksthe the fact is the jobs that will exist
 20 years from now we don't even have names for we can't even imagine the jobsthat
 exist and so when young people that i know go into college and they say heywhat should i major in and so on college
 is and should be less and less vocational as in oh i'm going to learnhow to do this and then i'm going to do
 that the rest of my career the world just isn't that way anymorewith the the exponential speed of things
 so the important thing is learning how to learn learning how to belive wired and adaptable that's really
 key and what i tell what i advise young people when i talk to themis you know what you digest
 that that's what gives you the raw storehouse ofthings that you can remix and and be
 creative with and so eat broadly and widelyand and obviously this is the wonderful
 thing about the internet world we live in now is you kind of can't help ityou're constantly whoa
 you know you go down some mole hole of wikipedia and you think oh i didn't evenrealize that it was a thing i didn't
 know that existed and so embrace that embrace that yeahexactly
 and what i tell people is just always do a gut check about okay i'm reading thispaper and yeah i think that
 but this paper wow that really i really cared about that in some way itell them just keep a real
 sniff out for that and when you find those things keep going down those paths

Speaker 0 :yeah don't be afraid i mean that that's
 one of the the challenges and the downsides of having so many beautifuloptions
 is that uh sometimes people are a little bit afraid to really commitbut that that's very true if if there's
 something that just sparks yeah your interest and passion just runwith it i mean that's
 it goes back to the hydera quote um i mean we only get this one life andthat trajectory
 it does it doesn't last forever so just if something sparks your imaginationyour passion is wrong with it yeah
 exactly i don't think there's a more uh beautiful way to end it david it's ahuge honor to finally
 meet you your work is inspiring so many people i've talked to so many people whoare passionate about
 neuroscience about the brain even outside that uhread your book so i hope uh i hope you
 keep doing so i i think you're already there with carlsagan i hope you continue growing um
 yeah it was honor talking today thanks so much great you too lex

Speaker 1 :wonderful thanks for listening to this

 with some words from david eagleman in his book some for details from theafterlife
 imagine for a moment there were nothing but the product of billions of years ofmolecules coming together
 and ratcheting up to natural selection that were composed only of highways offluids and chemicals sliding along
 roadways within billions of dancing cells thetrillions of synaptic connections
 hum in parallel that this vast egg-like fabricof micro thin circuitry runs algorithms
 undreamt of in modern science that these neuralprograms give rise to
 our decision making loves desires fears and aspirations to meunderstanding this would be a numinous
 experience better than anything ever proposed inany holy text
 thank you for listening and hope to see
