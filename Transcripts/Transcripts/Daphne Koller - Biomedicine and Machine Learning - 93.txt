Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Daphne Koller a professor of computer science at Stanford University aco-founder of Coursera with Andrew Eng
 and founder and CEO of in seat row a company at the intersection of machinelearning and biomedicine we're now in
 the exciting early days of using the data-driven methods of machine learningto help discover and develop new drugs
 and treatments at scale Daphne and in seat row are leading the way on thiswith breakthroughs they may ripple
 through all fields of medicine including ones most critical for helping with acurrent coronavirus pandemic this
 conversation was recorded before the cove 8:19 outbreak for everyone feelingthe medical psychological and financial
 burden of this crisis I'm sending love your way stay strongwe're in this together we'll beat this
 thing this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy itsubscribe I need to review it with five
 stars an apple podcast supported on patreon are simply connected me onTwitter Alex Friedman spelled Fri D ma M
 as usual I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle thatcan break the flow of this conversation
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience this showis presented by cash app the number-one

 PCI data security standard the cash shop is compliant with I'm a big fan ofstandards for safety and security PCI
 DSS is a good example of that where a bunch of competitors got together andagreed that there needs to be a global
 standard around the security of transactions now we just need to do thesame for Thomas vehicles and the ad

 conversation with Daphne Koller

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :so you co-founded Coursera I made a huge
 impact in the global education of AI and after five years in August 2016 wrote ablog post saying that you're stepping
 away and wrote quote it's time for me to turn to another critical challenge thedevelopment of machine learning and it's
 applications to improving human health so let me ask two far-out philosophicalquestions one do you think will one day
 find cures for all major diseases known today and two do you think will one dayfigure out a way to extend the human
 lifespan perhaps to the point of

Speaker 0 :immortality so one day is a very long
 time and I don't like to make predictions of the type we will never beable to do X because I think that's a
 you know that's the smacks of hubris it seems that never and in in in the entireeternity of human existence will we be
 able to solve a problem that being said curing disease is very hard becauseoftentimes by the time you discover the
 disease a lot of damage has already been done and so to assume that we would beable to cure disease at that stage
 assumes that we would come up with ways is basically regenerating entire partsof the human body in the way that
 actually returns it to its original state and that's a very challengingproblem we have cured very few diseases
 we've been able to provide treatment for an increasingly large number but thenumber of things that you could actually
 define to be cures is actually not that large so I think that's it there's a lotof work that would need to happen for
 one could legitimately say that we have cured even a reasonable number of far

Speaker 1 :less all diseases on the scale of 0 to
 100 where are we in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of all majordiseases what's your sense so from the
 computer science perspective that you've entered the world of health how faralong are we


Speaker 0 :I think it depends on which disease I
 mean there are ones where I would say we're maybe not quite at a hundredbecause biology is really complicated
 and there's always new things that we uncover that people didn't even realizeexisted so but I would say there's
 diseases where we might be in the seventies or eighties and then there'sdiseases in which I would say probably
 the majority where we're really close to

Speaker 1 :zero with Alzheimer's and schizophrenia
 and type 2 diabetes fall closer to zero or to the 80

Speaker 0 :I think Alzheimer's is probably closer
 to zero than to 80 there are hypotheses but I don't think those hypotheses haveas of yet been sufficiently validated
 that we believe them to be true and there is an increasing number of peoplewho believe there's a traditional
 hypotheses might not really explain what's going on I would also say thatAlzheimer's and schizophrenia and in
 even type 2 diabetes are not really one disease they're almost certainly aheterogeneous collection of mechanisms
 that manifests in clinically similar ways so in the same way that we nowunderstand that breast cancer is really
 not one disease it is multitude of cellular mechanisms all of whichultimately translate to uncontrolled
 proliferation but it's not one disease the same is almost undoubtedly true forthose other diseases as well that
 understanding that needs to precede any understanding of the specific mechanismsof any of those other diseases now in
 schizophrenia I would say we're almost certainly closer to zero than toanything else type 2 diabetes is a bit
 of a mix there are clear mechanisms that are implicated that I think have beenvalidated they have to do with insulin
 resistance and such but there's almost certainly there as well many mechanismsthat we have not yet understood you've


Speaker 1 :also thought and worked a little bit on
 the longevity side do you see the disease and longevity asoverlapping completely partially or not
 at all as efforts those mechanisms are

Speaker 0 :certainly overlapping there's a
 well-known phenomenon that says that for most diseases other than childhooddiseases the risk for getting for
 contracting that disease increases exponentially year-on-year every yearfrom the time you're about 40 so
 obviously there is a connection between those two things I that's not to saythat they're identical there's clearly
 aging that happens that is not really associated with any specific disease andthere's also diseases and mechanisms of
 disease that are not specifically related to aging so I think overlap is

Speaker 1 :where we're at okay it is a little
 unfortunate that would get older and it seems that there's some correlation withthe fact the the occurrence of diseases
 or the fact that we'll get all there mm-hmm and both are quite sad I mean

Speaker 0 :there's processes that happen as cells
 age that I think are contributing to disease some of those have to do withthe DNA damage that accumulates the
 cells divide where the repair mechanisms don't fully it correct for those thereare accumulations of proteins that are
 misfolded and potentially aggregate and those two contributes a disease andcontribute to inflammation there is an
 um there's a multitude of mechanisms that have been uncovered that are sortof wear and tear at the cellular level
 that contribute to disease processes that and I'm sure there's many that we

Speaker 1 :don't yet understand on a small tangent
 perhaps philosophical this uh the the fact that things get older and the factthat things die is a very powerful
 feature for the growth of new things that you know it's a learning it's akind of learning mechanism so it's both


Speaker 0 :tragic and beautiful so do you do you do


Speaker 1 :you so in you know in trying to fight
 disease and trying to fight aging do you thinkabout sort of the useful fact of our
 mortality or would you like what if you were could be immortal would you choose

Speaker 0 :to be immortal
 again I think immortal is a very long time I don't know that that wouldnecessarily be something that I would
 want to aspire to but I think all of us aspire to an increased health span Iwould say which is an increased amount
 of time where you're healthy and active and feel as you did when you were 20 andwe're nowhere close to that people
 deteriorate physically and mentally over time and that is a very sad phenomenonso I think a wonderful aspiration would
 be if we could all live to you know the biblical 120 may be in perfect health inmy quality of life high quality of life
 I think that would be an amazing goal for us to achieve as a society now isthe right age 120 or 100 or 150 I think
 that's up for debate but I think an increased health span is a really worthy

Speaker 1 :goal and anyway in a grand time the age
 of the universe it's all pretty short so from the perspective you've doneobviously a lot of incredible work on
 machine learning so what role do you think data and machine learning play inthis and his goal of trying to
 understand diseases in trying to

Speaker 0 :eradicate diseases up until now I don't
 think it's played very much of a significant role because largely thedata sets that one really needed to
 enable a powerful machine learning methods those data sets haven't reallyexisted there's been dribs and drabs and
 some interesting machine learning that has been applied I would say machinelearning / data science but the last few
 years are starting to change thoughts so we now see an increase in some largedata set
 but equally importantly an increase in technologies that are able to producedata at scale it's not typically the
 case that people have deliberately proactively used those tools for thepurpose of generating data for machine
 learning they to the extent that those techniques have been used for dataproduction they've been used for data
 production to drive scientific discovery and the machine learning came as a sortof by-product second stage of oh you
 know now we have a data set let's do machine learning on that rather than amore simplistic data analysis method but
 what we are doing it in seat rows actually flipping that around and sayinghere's this incredible repertoire of
 methods that bile engineers cell biologists have come up with let's seeif we can put them together in brand-new
 ways with the goal of creating data sets that machine learning can really beapplied on productively to create
 powerful predictive models that can help us address fundamental problems in human

Speaker 1 :health so really focus to get make data
 the the primary focus and the primary goal and find use the mechanisms ofbiology and chemistry to to uh to create
 the kinds of data set that could allow a machine learning to benefit the most I

Speaker 0 :wouldn't put it in those terms because
 that says the data is the end goal data's the means so for us the end goalis helping address challenges in human
 health and the method that we've elected to do that is to apply machine learningto build predictive models and machine
 learning in my opinion can only be really successfully applied especiallythe more powerful models if you give it
 data that is of sufficient scale and sufficient quality so how do you createthose data sets so as to drive the
 ability to generate predictive models which subsequently help improve human

Speaker 1 :health so before we dive into the
 details of that even take a step back and ask when and where was your interestin human health born are there moments
 events perhaps if I may ask tragedies in your own lifethat catalyzes passion or was at the
 broader desire to help humankind so I

Speaker 0 :would say it's a bit of both so on I
 mean my interest in human health actually dates back to the early 2000swhen when a lot of my peers and machine
 learning and I were using datasets that frankly we're not very inspiring some ofus old-timers still remember the
 quote-unquote twenty newsgroups dataset where it was literally a bunch of textfrom twenty newsgroups a concept that
 doesn't really even exist anymore and the question was can you classify whichwhich news group a particular bag of
 words came from and it wasn't very interesting the datasets at the time onthe biology side were much more
 interesting both from a technical and also from an aspirational perspectivethey were still pretty small but they
 were better than 20 news groups and so I started out I think just by just bywanting to do something that was more I
 don't know societally useful and technically interesting and then overtime became more and more interested in
 the biology in the and the human health aspects for themselves and began to workeven sometimes on papers that were just
 in biology without having a significant machine learning component I think myinterest in drug discovery is partly due
 to an incident I had with when my father sadly passed away about 12 years ago hehad an autoimmune disease that settled
 in his lungs and the doctors basis it well there was only one thing we coulddo which is give him prednisone at some
 point I remember doctor even came and said hey let's do a lung biopsy tofigure out which autoimmune disease he
 has and I said would that be helpful would that change treatments no there'sonly prednisone that's the only thing we
 can give him and I have friends who were rheumatologist who said the FDA wouldnever approve press his own today
 because the ratio of side effects to benefit isprobably not large enough today we're in
 a state where there's probably four or five maybe even more well depends forwhich autoimmune disease but there are
 multiple drugs that can help people with autoimmune disease and many of which canexist at 12 years ago and I think we're
 at a golden time in some ways and drug discovery where there's the ability tocreate drugs that are much more safe for
 much more effective than we've ever been able to before and what's lacking isenough understanding of biology and
 mechanism to know where to aim that weird ain't that engine and I thinkthat's where machine learning can help


Speaker 1 :so in 2018 he started and now lead a
 company in seat row which is a like you mentioned perhaps the focus is drugdiscovery and the utilization of machine
 learning for drug discovery so you mentioned that quote we're reallyinterested in creating what you might
 call a disease in a dish model disease in a dish models places where disease isa complex where we really haven't had a
 good model system or typical animal models that have been used for yearsincluding testing on mice just aren't
 very effective so can you can you try to describe what is an animal model andwhat what is a disease in a dish model


Speaker 0 :sure so an animal models for disease is
 where you create effectively its what it sounds like it's it's a oftentimes amouse where we have introduced some
 external perturbation that creates the disease and then we cure that diseaseand the hope is that by doing that we
 will cure a similar disease in human the problem is is that oftentimes the way inwhich we generate the disease and the
 animal has nothing to do with how that disease actually comes about in a humanit's what you might think of as a copy
 of the of phenotype a copy of the clinical outcomebut the mechanisms are quite different
 and so curing the disease in the animal which in most cases doesn't happennaturally mice don't get Alzheimer's
 they don't get diabetes they don't get atherosclerosis they don't get autism orschizophrenia those cures don't
 translate over to what happens in the human and that's where most drugs failsjust because the findings that we had in
 the mouse don't translate to a human the disease in the dish bottles is a fairlynew approach it's been enabled by
 technologies that have not existed for more than five to ten years so forinstance the ability for us to take a
 cell from any one of us you or me revert thats a skin cell to what's called stemcell status which is a what if it was
 called a pluripotent cell that can then be differentiated into different typesof cells so from that flurry potent cell
 one can create a wax neuron or a lex cardiomyocyte or alexa parasite that hasyour genetics but that right our cell
 type and so if there is a genetic burden of disease that would manifest in thatparticular cell type you might be able
 to see it by looking at those cells and saying oh that's what potentially sickcells look like versus healthy cells and
 understand how and then explore what kind of interventions might revert theunhealthy looking cell to a healthy cell
 now of course curing cells is not the same as curing people and so there'sstill potentially translate ability gap
 but at least for diseases that are driven say by human genetics and wherethe human genetics is what drives the
 cellular phenotype there is some reason to hope that if we revert those cells inwhich the disease begins and where the
 disease is driven by genetics and we can revert that cell back to a healthy statemaybe that will help also
 the more global clinical phenotypes that's really what we're hoping to do

Speaker 1 :that step that backward step I was
 reading about it the Yamanaka factor yes so think that the reverse step back tostem cells yes I think seems like magic


Speaker 0 :it is I'm honestly before that happened
 I think very few people would have predicted that to be possible it's

Speaker 1 :amazing can you maybe elaborate is it
 actually possible like word like how state so this result was maybe like Idon't know how many years ago maybe ten
 years ago was first demonstrated something like thatis this how hard is this like how noisy
 is this backward step it seems quite

Speaker 0 :incredible and cool it is it is
 incredible and cool it was much more I think finicky and bespoke at the earlystages when the discovery was first made
 but at this point it's become almost industrialized there are what's calledcontract research organizations vendors
 that will take a sample from a human and reverted back to stem cell status and itworks a very good fraction of the time
 now there are people who will ask I think good questions is this reallytruly a stem cell er doesn't remember
 certain aspects of what of changes that were made in the human beyond the

Speaker 1 :genetics it's fast as a skin cell yeah


Speaker 0 :it's fast as a skin cell or its past in
 terms of exposures to different environmental factors and so on so Ithink the consensus right now is that
 these are not always perfect and there is a little bits and pieces of memorysometimes but by and large these are


Speaker 1 :actually pretty good so one of the key
 things well maybe maybe you can correct me but one of the useful things formachine learning is size scale of data
 how easy it is to do these kinds of reversals to stem cells and then diseasein a dish models at scale is this that a
 huge challenge or or not so the reverse

Speaker 0 :the reversal is not as of this point
 something that can be done at the scale of tens of thousands or hundreds ofthousands I think total number of stem
 cells or iPS cells that are what's called induced pluripotent stem cells inthe world I think is somewhere between
 five and ten thousand last I looked now again that might not count things thatexist in this or that academic center
 and they may add up to a bit more but that's about the range so it's notsomething that you could this point
 generate IPS cells from a million people but maybe you don't need to becausemaybe that background is enough because
 it can also be now perturbed in different ways and some people have donereally interesting experiments in for
 instance taking cells from a healthy human and then introducing a mutationinto it using some of the using one of
 the other miracle technologies that's emerged last decade which is CRISPR geneediting and introduced mutation that is
 known to be pathogenic and so you can now look at the healthy cells andunhealthy cells the one with the
 mutation and do a one-on-one comparison where everything else is held constantand so you could really start to
 understand specifically what the mutation does at the cellular level sothe IPS cells are a great starting point
 and obviously more diversity is better because you also want to capture ethnicbackground and how that affects things
 but maybe you don't need one from every single patient with every single type ofdisease because we have other tools at


Speaker 1 :our disposal well how much difference is
 there between people I mentioned ethnic background in terms of IPS cells sowe're all like it seems like these
 magical cells that can do it to create anything between different populationsdifferent people is there a lot of
 variability between stem cells well

Speaker 0 :first of all there's the variability
 that's driven simply by the fact that genetically we're different so a stemcell let's drive for my genotype is
 gonna be different from itself stem cells derive from your genotype there'salso some differences that I have more
 to do with for whatever reason some people stem cells differentiatebetter than other people stem cells we
 don't entirely understand why so there's certainly some differences there as wellbut the fundamental difference and the
 one that we really care about and is a positive is that the is the fact thatthe genetics are different and therefore
 we capitulate my disease burden versus

Speaker 1 :your disease burden what's the disease


Speaker 0 :burden well it disease burden is just if
 you think I mean it's not a well-defined mathematical term although there aremathematical formulations of it
 it if you think about the fact that some of us are more likely to get a certaindisease than others because we have more
 variations in our genome that are causative of the disease maybe fewerthat are protective of the disease
 people have quantified that using what are called polygenic risk scores whichlook at all of the variations in an
 individual person's genome and add them all up in terms of how much risk theyconfer for a particular disease and then
 they've put people on a spectrum of their disease risk and for certaindiseases where we've been sufficiently
 powered to really understand the connection between the many many smallvariations that give rise to an
 increased disease risk there is some pretty significant differences in termsof the risk between the people say at
 the highest decile of this polygenic risk score and the people at the lowestdecile sometimes those other differences
 are you know factor of 10 or 12 higher so there's definitely a lot that ourgenetics contributes to disease risk
 even if it's not by any stretch the full

Speaker 1 :explanation and from the machine
 learning perspective their signal there

Speaker 0 :there is definitely signal in the
 genetics and there is even more signal we believe in looking at the cells thatare derived from those different
 genetics because in principle you could say all the signal is there the at thegenetics level so we don't need to look
 at the cells but our understanding of the biology so limited at this pointthen seeing what actually happens at the
 cellular level is a heck of a lot closer to the human clinical outcomethan looking at the genetics directly
 and so we can learn a lot more from it than we could by looking at genetics

Speaker 1 :alone so just to get a sense that enough
 it's easy to do but what kind of data is useful in this disease in a dish modellike what what are what's what's the
 source of raw data information and also for my outsider's perspective sort ofbiology and cells are squishy things and
 I think they are how do you connect

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :literally you connect the computer to to
 that which sensory mechanisms I guess so

Speaker 0 :that's another one of those revolutions
 that have happened the last ten years and that our ability to measure cellsvery quantitatively has also
 dramatically increased so back when I started doing biology and you know late90s early 2000s that was the initial era
 where we started to measure biology in really quantitative ways using thingslike microarrays where you would measure
 in a single experiment the activity level what's called expression level ofmultiple of every gene in the genome in
 that sample and that ability is what actually allowed us to even understandthat there are molecular subtypes of
 diseases like cancer where up until that point is like oh you have breast cancerbut then we looked we looked at the
 molecular data it was clear that there's different subtypes of breast cancer thatat the level of gene activity look
 completely different to each other so that was the beginning of this processnow we have the ability to measure
 individual cells in terms of their gene activity using what's called single cellRNA sequencing which basically sequences
 the RNA which is that activity level of different genes for every gene in thegenome and you could do that at single
 cell level so that's an incredibly powerful way of measuring cells I meanyou literally count the number of
 transcripts oh really turns that squishy thing in something that's digitalanother tremendous
 this data source that's emerged the last few years is microscopy and andspecifically even super resolution
 microscopy where you could use digital reconstruction to look at sub cellularstructures sometimes even things that
 are below the diffraction limit of light by doing a sophisticated reconstructionand again that gives you tremendous
 amount of information at the sub cellular level there's now more and moreways that an amazing scientists out
 there are developing for getting new types of information from even singlecells and so that is a way of turning
 those squishy things into digital data

Speaker 1 :into beautiful datasets but so that data
 said then with machine learning tools allows you to maybe understand thedevelopmental like the mechanism of the
 a particular disease and if it's possible to sort of at a high leveldescribe how does how does that help


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :lead to drug discovery that can help
 prevent reverse that mechanism so I

Speaker 0 :think there's different ways in which
 this data could potentially be used some people use it for scientific discoveryand say oh look we see this phenotype at
 the cellular level so let's try and work our way backwards and think which genesmight be involved in pathways that give
 rise that so that's a very sort of analytical method to sort of work ourway backwards using our understanding of
 known biology some people use it in a somewhat more you know sort of forwardthat would if that was a backward this
 would be forward which is to say okay if I can perturb this gene doesn't show aphenotype that is similar to what I see
 in disease patients and so maybe that gene is actually causal of the diseaseso that's a different way and then
 there's what we do which is basically to take that very large collection of theand use machine learning to uncover the
 patterns that emerge from it so for instance what are those subtypes thatmight be similar at the human clinical
 outcome but quite distinct when you look at the molecular data and then if we canidentify such a subtype are there
 interventions that if I apply it to cells that come from this subtype of thedisease and you apply that intervention
 it could be a drug or it could be a CRISPR gene intervention it does itrevert the disease state to something
 that looks more like normal happy healthy cells and so hopefully if yousee that that gives you a certain hope
 that that intervention will also have a meaningful clinical benefit to peopleand there's obviously a bunch of things
 that you would want to do after that to validate that but it's a very differentand much less hypothesis-driven way of
 uncovering new potential interventions and might give rise to things that arenot the same things that everyone else
 is already looking at that's uh I don't

Speaker 1 :know I'm just like to psychoanalyze my
 own feeling about our discussion currently it's so exciting to talk aboutso if I'm Ashiya fundamentally well
 something that's been turned into a machine learning problem and that sayscan have so much real-world impact
 that's kind of exciting because I'm so most of my days spent with datasets thatI guess closer to the news groups okay
 so this is a kind of it just feels good to talk about in fact I don't almostdon't want to talk about machine
 learning I want to talk about the fundamentals of the data set which iswhich is an exciting place to be I agree


Speaker 0 :with you it's what gets me up in the
 morning it's also what attracts a lot of the people who work at in seat row twoin seat row because I think all of the
 certainly all of our machine learning people are outstanding and could go geta job you know selling ads online or
 doing commerce or even self-driving cars yes but but I think they would want theythey come to us because what because
 they want to work on something that more of an aspirational nature and canreally benefit humanity what with these


Speaker 1 :with these approaches what do you hope
 what kind of diseases can be helped we mentioned Alzheimer said schizophreniatype 2 diabetes can you just describe
 the various kinds of diseases that this approach can it can help well we don't

Speaker 0 :know and I try and be very cautious
 about making promises about some things that o we will cure X that people makethat promise and I think it's I tried to
 first deliver and then promise as opposed to the other way around thereare characteristics of a disease that
 make it more likely that this type of approach can potentially be helpful sofor instance diseases have a very strong
 genetic basis are ones that are more likely to manifest and a stem cellderived model we would want the cellular
 models to be relatively reproducible and robust so that you could actually get aenough of those cells and in a way that
 isn't very highly variable and noisy you would want the disease to be relativelycontained in one or a small number of
 cell types that you could actually create in an in vitro in a dish settingwhereas if it's something that's really
 broad and systemic and involves multiple cells that are in very distal parts ofyour body putting that all in the dish
 is really challenging so we want to focus on the ones that are most likelyto be successful today with the hope I
 think that it's really smart bioengineers out there are developingbetter and better systems all the time
 so the diseases that might not be tractable today might be tractable inthree years so for instance five years
 ago these stem cell drive models didn't really exist people were doing most ofthe work in cancer cells and the cancer
 cells are very very poor models of most human biology because they're a theywere cancer to begin with and B as you
 passage them and they proliferate in a dish they become because of the genomicinstability even less
 similar to human biology now we have these stem cell derived models we havethe capability to reasonably robustly
 not quite at the right scale yet but close to derive what's called organoidswhich are these teeny little sort of
 multicellular organ of an organ system so there's cerebral organoids and liverorganoids and kidney organoids and yeah


Speaker 1 :brain organize organize possibly the


Speaker 0 :coolest thing I've ever seen and then I
 think we're starting to see things like connecting these organize to each otherso that you could actually start and
 there's some really cool papers that start to do that where you can actuallystart to say okay can we do multi organ
 system stuff there's many challenges that it's not easy by any stretch but itmight I'm sure people will figure it out
 and in three years or five years there will be disease moles that we could makefor things that we can't make today yeah


Speaker 1 :and this conversation would seem almost
 outdated with a kind of scale that could be achieved in like three years

Speaker 0 :that would be so cool the you've


Speaker 1 :co-founded Coursera with injurying and
 were part of the whole MOOC revolution so to jump topics a little bit can youmaybe tell the origin story of the
 history the origin story of MOOCs of Coursera and in general the yourteaching to huge audiences on a very
 sort of impactful topic of AI general so

Speaker 0 :I think the origin story of MOOCs
 emanates from a number of efforts that occurred at Stanford University aroundyou know the late 2000s where different
 individuals within Stanford myself included were getting really excitedabout the opportunities of using online
 technologies as a way of achieving both improved quality of teaching and alsoimproved scale and so Andrew for
 instance led the the for engineering everywhere which wassort of an attempt to take ten Stanford
 courses and put them online just as you know video lectures I led an effortwithin Stanford to take some of the
 courses and really create a very different teaching model that brokethose up into smaller units and had some
 of those embedded interactions and and so on which got a lot of support fromUniversity leaders because they felt
 like it was potentially a way of improving the quality of instruction inStanford by moving to what's now called
 the flipped classroom model and so those efforts eventually sort of started tointerplay with each other and created a
 tremendous sense of excitement and energy within the Stanford communityabout the potential of online teaching
 and led in the fall of 2011 to the launch of the first inferred MOOCs by

Speaker 1 :the way MOOCs it's probably impossible
 that people don't know but I guess massive open online courses but onlinecourses so they're not come up with the


Speaker 0 :acronym I'm not particularly fond of the
 acronym but it is what it is where this

Speaker 1 :Big Bang is not a great term for the
 start of the universe but it is what it

Speaker 0 :is probably so anyway we so those
 courses launched in in the fall of 2011 and there were within a matter of weekswith no real publicity campaign just a
 New York Times article that went viral about a hundred thousand students ormore in each of those courses and I
 remember this conversation that Andrew and I had was like wow just there's thisreal need here and I think we both felt
 like sure we were accomplished academics and we could go back and you know goback to our lives write more papers but
 if we did that then this wouldn't happen and it seemed too important not tohappen and so we spent a fair bit of
 time debating do we want to do this as a Stanford efforts kind of building onwhat we'd started do we want to do this
 as a for-profit company doing this is a non-profit and we decidedultimately to do it as we did with
 Coursera and so you know we started really operating as a company at thebeginning of 2012 but how did you was


Speaker 1 :that really surprising to you how how do
 you at that how did you at that time and at this time make sense of this need forsort of global education you mentioned
 that you felt that while the the popularity indicates that there's ahunger for sort of globalization of


Speaker 0 :learning I think there is a hunger for
 learning that you know globalization is part of it but I think it's just ahunger for learning the world has
 changed in the last 50 years it used to be that you finished college you got ajob by and large the skills that you
 learned in college were pretty much what got you through the rest of your jobhistory and and yeah you learned some
 stuff but it wasn't a dramatic change today we're in a world where the skillsthat you need for a lot of jobs they
 didn't even exist when you went to college and the jobs and many of thejobs that exist when you went the
 college don't even exist today or dying so part of that is due to AI but notonly and we need to find a way of
 keeping people giving people access to the skills that they need today and Ithink that's really what's driving a lot
 of this hunger so I think if we even

Speaker 1 :take a step back all for you all the
 start in trying to think of new ways to teach or to you know new ways to sort oforganize the material and present the
 material in a way that would help the education process the better gotcha yeahso what have you learned about effective
 education from this process of playing of experimenting with different ideas so

Speaker 0 :we learned a number of things some of
 which I think could translate back and have translated back effectively to howpeople teach on campus and some of which
 I think are more specific to people who learn onlineand more sort of people who learn as
 part of their daily life so we learned for instance very quickly that short isbetter so people who are especially in
 the workforce can't do a 15-week semester long course they just can't fitthat into their lives


Speaker 1 :shortly can you uh can you describe the
 shortness of what the the the entirety so every aspects of the little lectureshort this the less your short


Speaker 0 :the course is short both we started out
 you know the first online education efforts were actually mi t--'sOpenCourseWare initiatives and that was
 you know recording of classroom lectures and you know hour and a half or

Speaker 1 :something like that yeah that didn't


Speaker 0 :really work very well I mean some people
 benefit I mean of course they did but it's not really very palatableexperience for someone who has a job and
 you know three kids and that they need to run errands and such they can't fit15 weeks into their life and and the
 hour and a half is really hard so we learned very quickly and we started outwith short video modules and over time
 we made them shorter because we realized that 15 minutes was still too long ifyou want to fit in when you're waiting
 in line for your kids doctor's appointment it's better if it's 5 to 7we learned that 15 week courses don't
 work and you really want to break this up into shorter units so that there is anatural completion point gives people a
 sense of they're really close to finishing something meaningful they canalways come back and take part two and
 part three we also learned that compressing the content works reallywell because if some people that pace
 works well for others they can always rewind and watch again and so peoplehave the ability to then learn at their
 own pace and so that flexibility the the brevity and the flexibility are boththings that we found to be very
 important we learned that engagement during the content is important and thequicker you give people feedback the
 more likely they are to be engaged hence the introduction of these which weactually was an intuition that I had
 going in and and was then validated using data thatintroducing some of these sort of little
 quick micro quizzes into the lectures really helps self graded asautomatically graded assessments really
 help too because it gives people feedback see there you are so all theseare valuable and then we learn about two
 other things - oh we did some really interesting experiments for instance onthough gender bias and how having a
 female role model as an instructor can change the balance of men to women interms of especially in stem courses and
 you could do that online by doing a/b testing in ways that would be reallydifficult to go on campus oh that's


Speaker 1 :exciting but so the shortness the
 compression I mean that's actually so that that probably is true for all youknow good editing is always just
 compressing the content making it shorter so that puts a lot of burden onthe creator of the the instructor and
 the creator of the educational content probably most lectures at MIT orStanford could be five times shorter if
 the preparation was put was put enough so maybe people might disagree with thatbut like the Christmas the clarity that
 a lot of them like Coursera delivers is how much effort does that take so first

Speaker 0 :of all let me say that it's not clear
 that that crispness would work as effectively and a face-to-face settingbecause people need time to absorb the
 material and so you need to at least pause and give people a chance toreflect that maybe practice and that's
 what MOOCs do is that they give you these chunks of content and then ask youto practice with it and that's where I
 think some of the newer pedagogy that people are adopting and face-to-faceteaching they have to do with
 interactive learning and such it can be really helpful but both those approacheswhether you're doing that type of
 methodology and online teaching or in that flipped classroom interactive

Speaker 1 :teaching what site applause what's


Speaker 0 :flipped classroom flipped classroom is a
 way in which online content is used a supplement face-to-face teachingwhere people watch the videos perhaps
 and do some of the exercises before coming to class and then when they cometo classes actually to do much deeper
 problem solving oftentimes in a group but any one of those differentpedagogy's that are beyond just standing
 there and droning on in front of the classroom for an hour and 15 minutesrequire a heck of a lot more preparation
 and so it's one of the challenges I think that people have that we had whentrying to convince instructors to teach
 on Coursera and it's part of the challenges that pedagogy experts oncampus have in trying to get faculty to
 teach differently is that it's actually harder to teach that way than it is tostand there drone do you think MOOCs


Speaker 1 :will replace in-person education or
 become the majority of in-person of Education of the way people learn in thefuture again the future could be very
 far away but where's the trend going do

Speaker 0 :you think so I think it's a nuanced and
 complicated answer I don't think MOOCs will replace face-to-face teaching Ithink learning is in many cases a social
 experience and even at Coursera we had people who naturally formed study groupseven when they didn't have to just come
 and talk to each other and we found that that actually benefited their learningin very important ways so there was more
 success in among learners who had those study groups than among ones who didn'tso I don't think it's just gonna oh
 we're all gonna just suddenly learn online with a computer and no one elsein the same way that you know recorded
 music has not replaced live concerts but I do think that especially when you arethinking about continuing education the
 stuff that people get when they're traditional whatever high school collegeeducation is done and they yet have to
 maintain their level of expertise and skills in a rapidly changing world Ithink people will
 sooo more and more educational content in this online format because going backto school for formal education is not an
 option for most people

Speaker 1 :briefly I know it might be a difficult
 question to ask but there's a lot of people fascinated by artificialintelligence by machine learning but
 deep learning is there a recommendation for the next year or for a lifelongjourney as somebody interested in this
 how do they how do they begin how do they enter that learning journey I think

Speaker 0 :the important thing is first to just get
 started and there's plenty of online content that one can get for both thecore foundations of mathematics and
 statistics and programming and then from there to machine learning I wouldencourage people not to skip too quickly
 past the foundations because I find that there is a lot of people who learnmachine learning whether it's online or
 on campus without getting those foundations and they basically just turnthe crank on existing models in ways
 that they don't allow for a lot of innovation and an adjustment to theproblem at hand but also be or sometimes
 just wrong and they don't even realize that their application is wrong becausethere's artifacts that they haven't
 fully understood so I think the foundations machine learning is animportant step and then and then
 actually start solving problems try and find someone to solve them with becauseespecially at the beginning is useful to
 have someone to bounce ideas off and fix mistakes that you make and and you canfix mistakes that they make but but then
 just find practical problems whether it's in your workplace or if you don'thave that catechol competitions or such
 are a really great place to find interesting problems and just practice

Speaker 1 :practice perhaps a bit of a romanticized
 question but what idea in deep learning do you find have you found in yourjourney the most beautiful or surprising


Speaker 0 :or interesting


Speaker 1 :perhaps not just deep learning but AI in


Speaker 0 :general statistics good answer with two
 things one would be the foundational concept of end to end training which isthat you start from the raw data and you
 train something that is not like a single piece but rather the towards theactual goal that you're looking to from


Speaker 1 :the raw data to the outcome like and
 nothing no no details in between well

Speaker 0 :not no details but the fact that you I
 mean you could certainly introduce building blocks that were trainedtowards other tasks and actually coming
 to that in my second half of the answer but it doesn't have to be like a singlemonolithic blob in the middle actually I
 think that's not ideal but rather the fact that at the end of the day you canactually train something and goes all
 the way from the beginning to the end and the other one that I find reallycompelling is the notion of learning a
 representation that in its turn even if it was trained to another task canpotentially be used as a much more rapid
 starting point to solving a different task and that's I think reminiscent ofwhat makes people successful learners
 it's something that is relatively new in the machine learning space I think it'sunderutilized even relative to today's
 capabilities but more and more of how do we learn sort of reusable representation

Speaker 1 :so end to end and transfer learning yeah
 is it surprising to you that neural networks are able to in many cases dothese things it says it may be taking
 back to when you when you first would dive deep into neural networks or ingeneral even today is it surprising that
 neural networks work at all and work wonderfully to do this kind of raw andthen learning and even transfer learning


Speaker 0 :I think I was surprised by how
 well when you have large enough amounts of data it's possible to find ameaningful representation in what is an
 exceedingly high dimensional space and so I find that to be really exciting andpeople are still working out the math
 for that there's more papers on that every year and I think it's would bereally cool if we figured that out but
 that to me was a surprise because in the early days when I was starting my weighin machine learning and the data sets
 were rather small I think we we believed I believe that you needed to have a muchmore constrained and knowledge rich
 search space to really make to really get to a meaningful answer and I thinkit was true at the time what I think is
 is still a question is will a completely knowledge free approach where there's noprior knowledge going into the
 construction of the model is that going to be the solution or not it's notactually the solution today in the sense
 that the architecture of a you know convolutional neural network that's usedfor images is actually quite different
 to the type of networks it's used for language and yet different from the onethat's used for speech or biology or any
 other application there's still some insight that goes into the structure ofthe network to get the the right
 performance will you be able to come up with the universal learning machine Idon't know I wonder if there's always


Speaker 1 :has to be some insight injected
 somewhere or whether it can converge so you've done a lot of interesting workwith probabilistic graphical models in
 general Bayesian deep learning and and so on so can you maybe speak high levelhow can learning systems deal with


Speaker 0 :uncertainty one of the limitations I
 think of a lot of machine learning models is thatthey come up with an answer and you
 don't know how much you can believe that answer and oftentimes the the the answeris actually quite poorly calibrated
 relative to its uncertainties even if you look at where the um you know thethe the confidence that comes out of the
 say the neural network at the end and you ask how much more likely is ananswer of zero point eight versus zero
 point nine it's not really in any way calibrated to the to the actualreliability of that network and how true
 it is and the further away you move from the training data the more not only themore wrong then that workers often is
 more wrong and more confident in a strong answer and that is a seriousissue in a lot of application areas so
 when you think for instance about medical diagnosis as being maybe anepitome of how problematic this can be
 if you were training your network on a certain set of patients on a certainpatient population and I have a patient
 that is an outlier and there's no human that looks at this and that patient isput into a neural network in your
 network not only gives a completely incorrect diagnosis but it's supremelyconfident and it's wrong answer you
 could kill people so I think creating more of an understanding of how do youdo snut works that are calibrated in our
 uncertainty and can also say you know I give up I don't know what to say aboutthis particular data instance because
 I've never seen something that sufficiently liked it before I thinkit's going to be really important in
 mission-critical applications especially ones where human life is at stake andthat includes the you know medical
 applications but it also includes you know automated driving because you'dwant the network to be able to you know
 what I have no idea what this blob is that I'm seeing in the middle of therest I'm just gonna stop because I don't
 want to potentially run over a pedestrian that I don't recognize is

Speaker 1 :there good mechanisms ideas of how to
 allow learning systems to provide thatuncertainty whatever along with their
 predictions certainly people have come

Speaker 0 :up with mechanisms that involve Bayesian
 deep learning deep learning that involves Gaussian processes I mean thereis a slew of different approaches that
 people have come up with there's methods that use ensembles ofnetworks with trained with different
 subsets of theta or different random starting points those are actuallysometimes surprisingly good at creating
 a sort of set of how confident or not you are in your answer it's very much anarea of open research let's cautiously


Speaker 1 :French your back into the land of
 philosophy and speaking of AI systems providing uncertainty somebody likeStuart Russell believes that as we
 create more and more intelligent systems it's really important for them to befull of self-doubt
 because you know if they're given more and more power we want them the way tomaintain human control over a systems or
 human supervision which is true like you just mentioned with autonomous vehiclesit's really important to get human
 supervision when the car is not sure because if it's really confident it canin cases when it can get in trouble is
 going to be really problematic so let me ask about sort of the questions of AGIin human level intelligence I mean we
 talked about curing diseases now which is sort of fundamental thing we couldhave an impact today but yet people also
 dream of both understanding and creating intelligence is that something you thinkabout is that something you dream about
 is that something you think is within our reach to be thinking about ascomputer scientists boy let me tease


Speaker 0 :apart different parts of that question


Speaker 1 :the first question


Speaker 0 :yeah it's a multi-part question so let
 me start with the feasibility of AGI then I'll talk about the timelines alittle bit and then talk about well what
 controls does one need when protecting when thinking about protections and theAI space so you know I think AGI
 obviously is a long-standing dream that even our early pioneers in the space hadyou know the Turing test and so on are
 the earliest discussions of that we're obviously closer than we were 70 or soyears ago but I think it's still very
 far away I think machine learning algorithmstoday are Yui exquisitely good pattern
 recognizers in very specific problem domains where they have seen enoughtraining data to make good predictions
 you take a machine learning algorithm and you move a different version of eventhat same problem far less one that's
 different and it will just completely choke so I think we're nowhere close tothe versatility and flexibility of even
 a human toddler in terms of their ability to context switch and solvedifferent problems using a single
 knowledge-based single brain so am i desperately worried about the machinestaking over the universe and you know
 starting to kill people because they want to have more power I don't think so

Speaker 1 :well sort of to pause on that so you
 kind of intuited that super intelligence is a very difficult thing to achievethat were intelligent intelligent super


Speaker 0 :intelligence we're not even close to
 intelligence even just the greater

Speaker 1 :abilities of generalization of our
 current systems but we haven't answered all the parts you don't want to go into

Speaker 0 :the second


Speaker 1 :oh good we take but maybe another
 tangent you can also pick up as can we get in trouble with much Dumber systems

Speaker 0 :yes that is exactly where I was going
 okay so I so just to wrap up on the threatsof AGI I think that it seems to me a
 little early today to figure out protections against a human level orsuperhuman level intelligence who's
 where we don't even see the skeleton of what that would look like so it seemsthat it's very speculative on how what
 how to protect against that but we can definitely and have gotten into troubleon much Dumber systems and a lot of that
 has to do with the fact that the systems that we're building are increasinglycomplex increasingly poorly understood
 and there's ripple effects that are unpredictable in changing little thingsthat's gonna have dramatic consequences
 on the outcome and by the way that's not unique to artificial now this is I thinkartificial intelligence exacerbates that
 brings it to a new level but the heck our electric grid is reallycomplicated the software that runs our
 financial markets is really complicated and we've seen those ripple effectstranslate to dramatic negative
 consequences like for instance financial crashes that have to do with feedbackloops that we didn't anticipate so I
 think that's an issue that we need to be thoughtful about in many placesartificial intelligence being one of
 them and we should and I think it's really important that people arethinking about ways in which we can have
 better interpret ability of systems better tests for for instance measuringthe extent to which a machine learning
 system that was trained in one set of circumstances how well does it actuallywork in a very different set of
 circumstances where you might say for instance well I'm not going to be ableto test my automated via
 call in every possible City Village weather condition and so on but if youtrained it on this set of conditions and
 then tested it on 50 or 100 others that were quite different from the ones thatyou trained it on then I can it worked
 then that gives you confidence that the next 50 that you didn't test it on mightalso work so effectively testing for
 generalizability so I think there's ways that we should be constantly thinkingabout to validate the robustness of our
 systems I think it's very different from the let's make sure robots don't takeover the world
 and then the other place where I think we have a threat which is also importantfor us to think about is the extent to
 which technology can be abused so like any really powerful technologymachine learning can be very much used
 badly as well as too good and that goes back to many other technologies thathave come up with when people invented
 projectile missiles and it turns into guns and people invented nuclear powerand it turned nuclear bombs and I think
 honestly I would say that to me gene editing and CRISPR is at least asdangerous at technology if used
 badly than machine as machine learning you could create really nasty virusesand such using gene editing that are you
 know you would be really careful about so anyway that's something that we needto be really thoughtful about whenever
 we have any really powerful new technology yeah and on the case of

Speaker 1 :machine learning is at the stereo
 machine learning so all the kinds of attacks like security almost threats andthere's a social engineering with
 machine learning algorithm and big

Speaker 0 :brother's watching you and there is the
 killer drones that can potentially go and targeted execution of people in adifferent country I don't you know want
 them are he that are not necessarily that much better butbut you know people want to kill someone
 they'll find a way to do it so if you if

Speaker 1 :in general if you look at trends in the
 data there's less Wars there's just violence there's more human rights sowe've been doing overall quite good as a
 human species are you are you optimistic maybe another way to ask is do you thinkmost people are good and fundamentally
 we tend towards a better world which is underlying the question well machinelearning what gene editing ultimately
 land us somewhere good are you

Speaker 0 :optimistic I think by and large I'm
 optimistic I think that most people mean well that doesn't mean that most peopleare you know altruistic do-gooders but I
 think most people mean well but I think it's also really important for us as asociety to create social norms we're
 doing good and being perceived well by our peers is are positively correlated Imean it's very easy to create
 dysfunctional societies there's certainly multiple psychologicalexperiments as well as sadly real-world
 events where people have devolved to a world where being perceived well by yourpeers is correlated with really
 atrocious often genocide 'el behaviors so we really want to make sure that wemaintain a set of social norms where
 people know that to be a successful member of society you want to be doinggood and one of the things that I
 sometimes worry about is that some societies don't seem to necessarily bemoving in the forward direction in that
 regard where it's not necessarily the case that doingthat being a good person is what makes
 you be perceived well by your peers and I think that's a really important thingfor us as a society to remember it's
 very easy to degenerate back into a universe where it's okay to do reallybad stuff and still have your peers
 think you're amazing it's fun to ask a

Speaker 1 :world-class computer scientist and
 engineer a ridiculously philosophical question like what is the meaning oflife let me ask what gives your life
 meaning what are what is the source of fulfilment happiness joy purpose when we

Speaker 0 :were starting Coursera in the fall of
 2011 that was right around the time that Steve Jobs passed away and so the mediawas full various famous quotes Heath uh
 turd and one of them that really stuck with me because it resonated with stuffthat I'd been feeling for even years
 before that is that our goal in life should be to make a dent in the universeso I think that to me what gives my life
 meaning is that I would hope that when I am lying there on my deathbed andlooking at what I'd done in my life that
 I can point to ways in which I have left the world a better place than it waswhen I entered it this is something I
 tell my kids all the time because I also think that the burden of that is muchgreater for those of us who were born to
 privilege and in some ways I was I mean it wasn't more than wealthy or anythinglike that but I grew up in an educated
 family with parents who loved me and took care of me and I had a chance at agreat education and and so I and I've
 always had enough to eat so I was in many ways born to privilege more thanthe vast majority of humanity and my
 kids I think are even more so born to privilegethen I was fortunate enough to be and I
 think it's really important that for especially for those of us who have thatopportunity that we use our lives to
 make the world a better place I don't
