Speaker 0 :ma an and now here's my conversation


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :with Vijay Kumar


Speaker 1 :what is the first robot you've ever


Speaker 0 :built over a part of building way back
 when I was in graduate school I was part of a fairly big project that involvedbuilding a very large hexapod suede
 close to 7,000 pounds and it was powered by hydraulic actuation or was actuatedby hydraulics with 18 motors hydraulic
 motors controlled by an Intel 80-85 processorand an internal 8086 coprocessor and so
 imagine this huge monster that had 18 joints each controlled by an independentcomputer and there was a 19th computer
 that actually did the coordination between these 18 joints so as part ofthis project and my thesis work was how
 do you coordinate the 18 legs and in particular the the pressures and thehydraulic cylinders to get efficient


Speaker 1 :locomotion it sounds like a giant mess
 so how difficult is it to make all the motors communicate presumably you haveto send signals hundreds of times a


Speaker 0 :second or at least this was not my work
 but the folks who worked on this wrote what I believe to be the firstmultiprocessor operating system this was
 in the 80s and you have to make sure that obviously messages got across fromone joint to another you have to
 remember the the clock speeds on those computers were about half a megahertz

Speaker 1 :right the eighties so not to romanticize
 the notion but how did it make you feel to make to see that robot move it was

Speaker 0 :amazing
 in hindsight it looks like well we built this thing which really should have beenmuch smaller and of course today's
 robots are much smaller you look at you know Boston Dynamics or ghost roboticshas been off from from Penn but back
 then you're stuck with the substrate you had the compute you had so things wereunnecessarily big but at the same time
 and this is just human psychology somehow bigger means grander you knowpeople never had the same appreciation
 for nanotechnology or nano devices as they do for the space shuttle or the

Speaker 1 :Boeing 747 yeah you've actually done
 quite a good job at illustrating that small is beautiful in terms of roboticsso what is on that topic is the most
 beautiful or elegant robe in motion that you've ever seen not topick favorites or whatever but something
 that just inspires you that you remember

Speaker 0 :well I think thing that I'm I'm most
 proud of that my students have done is really think about small UAVs that canmaneuver and constrain spaces and in
 particular their ability to coordinate with each other and formthree-dimensional patterns so once you
 can do that you can essentially create 3d objects in the sky and you can deformthese objects on the fly
 so in some sense your toolbox of what you can create has suddenly got enhancedand before that we did the
 two-dimensional version of this so we had ground robots forming patterns andand so on so that that was not as
 impressive it was not as beautiful but if you do it in 3d suspended in midairand you've got to go back to 2011 when
 we did this now it's actually pretty standard to do these things eight yearslater but back then it was a big


Speaker 1 :accomplishment so the distributed
 cooperation is where is what Beauty

Speaker 0 :emerges in your eyes I think beauty to
 an engineer is very different from from Beauty to you know someone who's lookingat robots from the outside if you will
 yeah but what I meant there so before we said that grand is associated with sizeand another way of thinking about this
 is just the physical shape and the idea that you can get physical shapes inmidair and have them deform that's


Speaker 1 :beautiful but the individual components
 the agility is beautiful too right

Speaker 0 :so then how quickly can you actually
 manipulate these three-dimensional shapes and the individual components yes

Speaker 1 :right oh by the way said UAV unmanned
 aerial vehicle what was a good term for drones UAVs quad copters is there a termthat's then being standardized I don't


Speaker 0 :know if that is everybody wants to use
 the word drones and I often said there's drones to me is a pejorative word itsignifies something that's that's dumb
 the pre program that does one little thing andto anything but drones so I actually
 don't like that word but that's what everybody uses you could call itunpiloted and paladin ah but even
 unpiloted could be radio control could be remotely controls in many differentways and I think the right word is
 thinking about it is an aerial robot you

Speaker 1 :also say agile autonomous aerial robot


Speaker 0 :right yeah so agility is an attribute
 but they don't have to be so what

Speaker 1 :biological system because you've also
 drawn a lot of inspiration of those I've seen bees and ants that you've talkedabout what living creatures have you
 found to be most inspiring as an engineer instructive in your work in

Speaker 0 :robotics to me so ants are really quite
 incredible creatures right so you I mean the individuals arguably are very simpleand how they're they're built and yet
 they're incredibly resilient as a population and as individuals they'reincredibly robust so you know if you
 take an ant at six legs you remove one like it still works just fine and itmoves along and I don't know that even
 realizes it's lost alike so that's the robustness at the individual ant levelbut then you you look about this
 instinct for self-preservation of the colonies and they adapt in so manyamazing ways you know transcending
 transcending gaps and and by just chaining themselves together when youhave a flood being able to recruit other
 team mates to carry big morsels of food and then going out in differentdirections looking for food
 and then being able to demonstrate consensus even though they don'tcommunicate directly with each other the
 way we communicate with each other in some sense they also know how to dodemocracy probably better than what we


Speaker 1 :do yeah somehow the even democracy is
 emergent it seems like all the phenomena that we see is all emergent it seemslike there's no centralized communicator


Speaker 0 :there is so that I think a lot is made
 about that word emergen and means lots of things ofdifferent people but you're absolutely
 right I think as an engineer you think about what element elemental behaviorswere primitives you could synthesize so
 that the whole looks incredibly powerful incredibly synergistic the wholedefinitely being greater than the sum of
 the parts and ants are living proof of that

Speaker 1 :so when you see these beautiful swarms
 where there's biological systems of a robots do you sometimes think of them asa single individual living intelligent
 organism so it's the same as thinking of our human civilization as one organismor do you still as an engineer think
 about the individual components and all the engineering that went into theindividual components oh that's very


Speaker 0 :interesting
 so again philosophically as engineers what we want to do is to go beyond theindividual components the individual
 units and think about it as a unit as a cohesive unit without worrying about theindividual components if you start
 obsessing about the individual building blocks and what they do you inevitablywill find it hard to scale up and just
 mathematically just think about individuals things you want a model andif you want to have ten of those then
 you essentially are taking cartesian products of ten things that makes itreally complicated than to do any kind
 of synthesis or design and that high dimensional space is really hard so theright way to do this is to think about
 the individuals in a clever way so that at the higher level when you look atlots and lots of them abstractly you can
 think of them in some low dimensional

Speaker 1 :space so what does that involve for the
 individual you have to try to make the way they see the world as local aspossible and the other thing do you just
 have to make them robust to collisions like you said with the ants if somethingfails that the whole swarm doesn't fail


Speaker 0 :right I think as engineers we do this I
 mean you know think about we build planes will rebuild iPhonesand we know that by taking individual
 components well engineered components with well specified interfaces thatbehave in a predictable way you can
 build complex systems so that's ingrained I would I would claim and mostengineers thinking and it's true for
 computer scientists as well I think what's different here is that you wantthe individuals to be robust in some
 sense as we do in these other settings but you also want some degree ofresiliency for the population and so you
 really want them to be able to re-establish communication with theirneighbors you want them to rethink their
 strategy for group behavior you want them to reorganize and that's where Ithink a lot of the challenges lie so


Speaker 1 :just at a high level what does it take
 for a bunch of which we call them flying robots to create a formation just forpeople when I familiar with robotics in
 general how much information is needed how do you how do you even make ithappen without a centralized controller


Speaker 0 :so I mean there are a couple of
 different ways of looking at this if you are a purist you think of it as a as away of recreating what nature does
 so nature forms groups for several reasons but mostly it's because of thisinstinct that organisms have of
 preserving their colonies their population which means what you needshelter you need food you need to
 procreate and that's basically it so the kinds of interactions you see are allorganic they're all local and the only
 information that they share and mostly it's indirectly is to again preserve theherd of the flock or the swarm in and
 either by looking for new sources of food are looking for new shelters rightas engineers when we build swarms we
 have a mission and when you think of a mission and it involves mobility mostoften it's described in some kind of a
 global coordinate system as a human as an operator as a commander or as acollaborator I have my coordinate system
 and I want the robots to be consistent with that so I might think of itslightly differently I might want the
 robots to recognize that coordinate system which means not only do they haveto think locally in terms of who their
 immediate neighbors are but they have to be cognizant of of what the globalenvironment looks like so if I go if I
 say surround this building and protect this from intruders well they'reimmediately in a building centered
 coordinate system and I have to tell them where the building is and they're

Speaker 1 :globally collaborating on the map of
 that building there they're maintaining some kind of global not just in theframe of the building but there's
 information that's ultimately being built up explicitly as opposed to kindof implicitly like nature might correct


Speaker 0 :correct so in some sense nature is very
 very sophisticated but the tasks that nature solves or needs to solve are verydifferent from the kind of engineered
 tasks artificial paths that we are Forrester address and again there'snothing preventing us from solving these
 other problems but ultimately through our impact you want these forms to dosomething useful and so you're kind of
 driven into this very unnatural if you will unnatural meaning not like hownature does setting and it's a little


Speaker 1 :probably a little bit more expensive to
 do it the way nature does because nature is less sensitive to the loss of theindividual and cost wise in robotics I
 think you're more sensitive to losing

Speaker 0 :individuals I I think that's true
 although if you look at the price to performance ratio of robotic componentsit's it's coming down dramatically right
 it continues to come down so I think we're asymptotically approaching themajor where we would get yeah the cost
 of individuals will really become insignificant yeah so let's step back at

Speaker 1 :a high low of you the impossible
 question of what kind of as an overview what kind of autonomous flying vehiclesare there in general I think the ones


Speaker 0 :that receive a lot of notoriety are
 obviously the military vehicles military vehicles are controlled by a basestation but have a lot of human
 supervision but I have limited autonomy which is the ability to go from point Ato point B and even the more
 sophisticated now sophisticated vehicles can do autonomous takeoff and landing

Speaker 1 :and those usually have wings and they're


Speaker 0 :heavy usually their wings but then
 there's nothing preventing us from doing this for helicopters as well so I meanthere are many military organizations
 that have autonomous helicopters in the same vein and by the way you look atauto pilots and airplanes and it's it's
 actually very similar in fact I can one interesting question we can ask is ifyou look at all the air safety
 violations all the crashes that occurred yeah would there happen if the planewere truly autonomous and I think you'll
 find that any other cases you know because ofpilot error we made silly decisions and
 so in some sense even an air-traffic commercial air traffic there's a lot ofapplications although we only see
 autonomy being enabled at very high altitudes when when the pilot to the theplane is on autopilot there's still a


Speaker 1 :role for the human and that kind of
 autonomy is you're kind of implying I don't know what the right word is butit's a little dumb dumber and it could


Speaker 0 :be right so so in the lab right course
 we could we can we can afford to be a lot more aggressive and the question wetry to ask is can we make robots that
 will be able to make decisions without any kind of external infrastructureright so what does that mean so the most
 common piece of infrastructure that airplanes use today is GPS GPS is alsothe most brutal form of information if
 you have driven in a city tried to use GPS navigation you know in tallbuildings you immediately lose GPS and
 so that's not a very sophisticated way of building autonomy I think the secondpiece of infrastructure they rely on is
 communications again it's very easy to jam communications in fact if you useWi-Fi you know that Wi-Fi signals drop
 out cell signals drop out so to rely on something like that is not is not goodthe third form of infrastructure we we
 use and I hate to call it infrastructure but but it is that in the sense ofrobots it's people so you could rely on
 somebody to pilot you right and so the question you want to ask is if there areno pilots
 there's no communications of any base station if there's no knowledge ofposition and if there's no a priori map
 a priori knowledge of what the environment looks like a priori model ofwhat might happen in the future can
 robots navigate so that is true autonomy

Speaker 1 :right so that's that's true autonomous
 and we're talking about you may like military applications and dronesokay so what else is there you talk
 about agile autonomous flying robots aerial robots so that's a different kindof it's not winged it's not big at least


Speaker 0 :its small so I used the word agility
 mostly or at least we're motivated to do agile robots mostly because robots canoperate and should be operating in
 constrained environments and if you want to operate the way a Global Hawkoperates I mean the kinds of conditions
 in which you operate are and very very restrictive if you go want to go insidea building for example for search and
 rescue or to locate an active shooter or you want to navigate under the canopy inan orchard to look at health of plants
 or to look for to count to count fruits to measure the tree the tree trunksthese are things we do by the way as


Speaker 1 :cool agriculture stuff you've shown in
 the past is really alright so in those

Speaker 0 :kinds of settings you do need that
 agility agility and does not necessarily mean you break records for the hundredmeters - what it really means is you see
 the unexpected and you're able to maneuver in a safe way and in a way thatthat gets you the most information about
 the thing you're trying to do by the way

Speaker 1 :you may be the only person who in a TED
 talk has used a math equation which is amazing people should go see what

Speaker 0 :actually it's very interesting because
 the Ted curator Chris Anderson told me you can't show math and you know Ithought about it but but that's who I am
 and that's that's what that's our work and so I felt compelled to give theaudience a taste for at least some math


Speaker 1 :so on that point simply what does it
 take to make a thing with four motors fly a quadcopter one of these littleflying robots you know how hard is it to
 make it fly how do you coordinate them four motors what's how do you convertthere's those motors into actual


Speaker 0 :movement so this is an interesting
 question we've been trying to do this since 2000 it is a commentary on thesensors that were available back then
 the computers that were available back then and a number of things happenedbetween 2000 and 2007 one is the
 advances in computing which is and so we all know about Moore's law but I think2007 was a tipping point the year of the
 iPhone the year of the cloud lots of things happen in 2007 but going backeven further inertial measurement units
 as a sensor really matured again lots of reasons for that certainly there's a lotof federal funding particularly DARPA in
 the US but they didn't anticipate this boom in I amuse but if you looksubsequently what happened is it every
 year every car manufacturer had to put an airbag in which meant you had to havean accelerometer onboard and so that
 drove down the price to performance ratio oliver's so I should know this

Speaker 1 :that's very interesting yeah it's very
 interesting the connection there and

Speaker 0 :that's why research is very it's very
 hard to predict the outcomes and again the federal government spent a ton ofmoney on things that they thought were
 useful for resonators but it ended up enabling these small UAVs yeah which isgreat because I could have never raised
 that much money and told you no soul this project hey we want to build thesesmall UAVs can you can you actually fund
 the development of low-cost dire news so

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :why do you need an IMU and so so so I
 was I'll come back to that but but so in 2007 2008 we were able to build theseand then the question you're asking was
 a good one how do you coordinate the motors to develop this but over the last10 years everything is commoditized a
 high school kid today can pick up a Raspberry Pi kit and build us all thelow levels functionality is all
 automated but basically at some level you have to drive the motors at theright rpms the right
 velocity in order to generate the right amount of thrust in order to position itand orient it in a way that you need to
 in order to fly the feedback that you get is from onboard sensors and the IMUis an important part of it the IMU tells
 you what the acceleration is as well as what the angular velocity is and thoseare important pieces of information in
 addition to that you need some kind of local position or velocity informationfor example when we walk we implicitly
 have this information because we kind of know how how would our stride length iswe also are looking at images fly past
 our retina if you will and so we can estimate velocity we also haveaccelerometers in our head and we're
 able to integrate all these pieces of information to determine where we are aswe walk and so robots have to do
 something very similar you need an IMU you need some kind of a camera or othersensor that's measuring velocity and
 then you need some kind of a global reference frame if you really want tothink about doing something in a world
 coordinate system and so how do you estimate your position with respect tothat global reference frame that's
 important as well so coordinating the

Speaker 1 :RPMs of the four motors is what allows
 you to first of all fly and hover and then you can change the orientation andthe velocity of the and so on exactly
 exactly bunch of degrees of freedom six

Speaker 0 :degrees of freedom but you only have
 four inputs the four motors and and it turns out to be a remarkably versatileconfiguration you think at first well I
 only have four motors how do I go sideways but it's not too hard to saywell if I tell myself I can go sideways
 and then you have four motors pointing up how do i how do I rotate in placeabout a vertical axis
 well you rotate them at different speeds and that generation reaction moments inthat allows you to turn so it's actually
 a pretty it's an optimal configuration fromfrom engineer standpoint it's it's very
 simple very cleverly done and and very

Speaker 1 :versatile so if you could step back to a
 time so I've always known flying robots as the to me it was natural that thequadcopter should fly but when you first
 started working with it like how surprised are you that you canmake do so much with the four motors how
 surprising is e this thing fly first of all you can make it hover then you canadd control to it firstly this is not


Speaker 0 :the four motor configuration is not ours
 you could it has at least a hundred year history and with various people variouspeople try to get quad rotors to fly
 without much success as I said we've been working on this since 2000 ourfirst designs were well this is way too
 complicated why not we try to get an omnidirectionalflying robots or so our early designs we
 had eight folders and so these eight rotors were arranged uniformly on asphere if you will so you can imagine a
 symmetric configuration and so you should be able to fly anywhere but thereal challenge we had is the strength to
 weight ratio is not enough and of course we didn't have the sensors and so on soeverybody knew or at least the people
 who work with rotor crafts knew four rotors we get it done so that was notour idea but it took a while before we
 could actually do the onboard sensing and the computation that was needed forthe kinds of agile maneuvering that we
 wanted to do in our little aerial robots and that only happened between 2007 and2009 in our life yeah and you have to


Speaker 1 :send the signal may hundred times a
 second so the compute there is everything has to come down in price andwhat are the steps of getting from point
 A to point B so you just talked about like local control but if all the kindof cool
 dancing in the air that I've seen you show how do you make it happen it wouldhave trajector make a trajectory
 first of all okay figure out a trajectory so planet trajectory and thenhow do you make that trajectory happen I


Speaker 0 :think planning is a very fundamental
 problem in robotics I think you know 10 years ago it was an esoteric thing buttoday with self-driving cars you know
 everybody can understand this basic idea that a car sees a whole bunch of thingsand it has to keep a lane or maybe make
 a right turn or switch lanes it has to plan a trajectory it has to be safe ithas to be efficient so everybody's
 familiar with that that's kind of the first step that that you have to thinkabout when you when you when you when
 you say autonomy and so for us it's about finding smooth motions motionsthat are safe so we think about these
 two things one is optimality we want a safety clearly you don't you cannotcompromise safety so you're looking for
 safe optimal motions the other thing you have to think about is can you actuallycompute a reasonable trajectory in a
 fast manner in a small amount of time because you have a time budget so theoptimal becomes suboptimal but in our
 lab we we focus on synthesizing smooth trajectory that satisfy all theconstraints in other words don't violate
 any safety constraints and is as efficient as possible and when I sayefficient it could mean I want to get
 from point A to point B as quickly as possibleor I want to get to it as gracefully as
 possible or I want to consume as little energy as possible but always staying

Speaker 1 :within the safety constraints but yes


Speaker 0 :always finding a safe trajectory so


Speaker 1 :there's a lot of excitement and progress
 in the field of machine learning yes and reinforcement learning and the neuralnetwork variant of that with deep
 reinforcement learning DS do you see a role of machine learning in so a lot ofthe successful flying robots did not
 rely on machine learning except for maybe a little bit of theperception the computer vision side on
 the control side and the planning do you see there's a role in the future for

Speaker 0 :machine learning so let me disagree a
 little bit with you I think we never perhaps called out and my work calledout learning but even this very simple
 idea of being able to fly through a constrained space the first time you tryit you'll invariably you might get it
 wrong even if the task is challenging and the reason is to get it perfectlyright you have to model everything in
 the environment and flying is notoriously hard to model there areaerodynamic effects that we constantly
 discover even just before I was talking to you I was starting to a student abouthow blades flap when they fly well and
 that ends up changing how a rotor craft is accelerated in the angular direction

Speaker 1 :this is like micro flaps or something is


Speaker 0 :smooth it's not microfiber you assume
 that each blade is is rigid but actually it flaps a little bit oh it bendsinteresting yeah and so the models rely
 on the fact on the on an assumption that they're they're actually rigid butthat's not true if you're flying really
 quickly these effects become significant if you're flying close to the ground youget pushed off by the ground right
 something which every pilot knows when he tries to land or she tries to landthis is called a ground effect something
 very few pilots think about is what happens when you go close to a ceilingwell you get sucked into a ceiling there
 are very few aircrafts that fly close to any kind of ceiling likewise when you goclose to close to a wall there are these
 wall effects and if you've gone on a train and you pass another train that'straveling in the opposite direction you
 feel the buffeting and so these kinds of microclimates effect our UAVssignificantly so impossible to model


Speaker 1 :essentially if I wouldn't say they're


Speaker 0 :impossible to model but the level of
 sophistication you would need in the model and the software would betremendous plus to get everything right
 would be awfully tedious so the way we do this is over time we figure out howto adapt to these conditions
 so we've early on we use the form of learning that we call iterative learningso this idea if you want to perform a
 task there are a few things that you need to change and iterate over fewparameters that over time you can you
 can you can figure out so I could call it policy gradient reinforcementlearning but actually this is iterative
 learning learning and so this was their way back I think what's interesting isif you look at autonomous vehicles today
 learning occurs could occur in two pieces one is perception understandingthe world second is action taking
 actions everything that I've seen that is successful is on the perception sideof things so in computer vision we've
 made amazing strides in the last ten years so recognizing objects actuallydetecting objects classifying them and
 and tagging them in some sense annotating them this is all done throughmachine learning on the action side on
 the other hand I don't know if any examples where there are fielded systemswhere we actually learn the right


Speaker 1 :behavior outside a single demonstration
 of successfully you know in the

Speaker 0 :laboratory this is the holy grail can
 you do end-to-end learning can you go from pixels to motor block modeoccurrence this is really really hard
 and I think if you look go forward the right way to think about these thingsis data driven approaches learning based
 approaches in concert with model-based approaches which is the traditional wayof doing things by so I think there's a
 piece there's a role for each of these methodologies so what do you think just

Speaker 1 :jumping out in topic since you mention
 autonomous vehicles what do you think are the limits and the perception sighsso I've talked to Elon Musk and they're
 on the perception side they're using primarily computer vision tosee the environment in your work with
 because you work with a real world a lot in the physical world what are thelimits of computer vision do you think
 you can solve autonomous vehicles focus on the perception side focusing onvision alone and machine learning so you


Speaker 0 :know we also have a spin-off company X
 and technologies that that works underground in mines you go into minesthere they're dark they're dirty you fly
 in a dirty area there's stuff you kick up from by the propellers the downwashkicks up dust I challenge you to get a
 computer vision algorithm to work there yeah so we used lighters in that settingindoors and even outdoors when we fly
 through fields I think there's a lot of potential for just solving the problemusing computer vision alone but I think
 the bigger question is can you actually solve or can you actually identify allthe corner cases using a sense single
 sensing modality and using learning

Speaker 1 :alone so what's your intuition there so


Speaker 0 :look if you have a corner case and your
 algorithm doesn't work your instinct is to go get data about the corner case andpatch it up learn how to deal with that
 corner case but at some point this is going to saturate this approach is notviable
 so today computer vision algorithms can detect 90% of the objects or can detectobjects 90% of the time classify them
 90% of the time cats on the Internet I probably can do 95 percent on here butto get from 90% to 99% you need a lot
 more data and then I tell you well that's not enough because I have asafety critical application I want to go
 from 99% to 99.9 percent that's even more data so I think if you look atwanting accuracy on the x-axis and look
 at the amount of data on the y-axis I believe that curve is an exponential

Speaker 1 :curve Wow okay it's even hard if it's
 linear

Speaker 0 :it's hard if it's linear totally but I
 think it's exponential and the other thing you have to think about is thatthis process is a very very power hungry
 process to run data farms or solar power

Speaker 1 :you mean literally power literally power


Speaker 0 :literally power so in 2014 five years
 ago and I don't have more recent data two percent of US electricityconsumption was from data forms so we
 think about this as an information science and information processingproblem actually it is an energy
 processing problem and so unless we figured out better ways of doing this Idon't think this is viable so talking


Speaker 1 :about driving which is a safety critical
 application and some aspect the flight is safety critical maybe philosophicalquestion maybe an engineering one what
 problem do you think is harder to solve autonomous driving or autonomous flight

Speaker 0 :that's a really interesting question I
 think autonomous flight has several advantages that autonomous drivingdoesn't have so look if I want to go
 from point A to point B I have a very very safe trajectory go vertically up toa maximum altitude fly horizontally to
 just about the destination and then come down vertically this is pre-programmedthe equivalent of that is very hard to
 find in a self-driving car car world because you're on the ground you're in atwo-dimensional surface and the
 trajectories in the two-dimensional surface are more likely to encounterobstacles I mean this in an intuitive
 sense but mathematically true that's mathematically as well that's true

Speaker 1 :there's another option on the 2g space
 of platooning or because there's so many obstacles you can connect with thoseobstacles and all these those exist in


Speaker 0 :the three-dimensional space is wrong so


Speaker 1 :they do so the question also implies how
 difficult are obstacles in the three-dimensional space in flight so so

Speaker 0 :that's the downside I think in
 three-dimensional space you're modeling three-dimensional world not just justbecause you want to avoid it but you
 want a reason about it you want to work in thethree-dimensional environment and that's
 significantly harder so that's one disadvantage I think the seconddisadvantage is of course anytime you
 fly you have to put up with the peculiarities of aerodynamics andthey're complicated environments how do
 you negotiate that so that's always a problem if you see a time in the future

Speaker 1 :where there is you mentioned them
 there's an agriculture application so there's a lot of applications of flyingrobots but do you see a time in the
 future where there is tens of thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands ofdelivery drones they fill the sky a
 delivery flying robots I think there's a

Speaker 0 :lot of potential for the last mile
 delivery and so in crowded cities I don't know if you go if you go to aplace like Hong Kong just crossing the
 river can take half an hour and while a drone can just do it in in five minutesat most
 I think you look at a delivery of supplies to remote villages I work witha nonprofit called weave robotics
 they work in the Peruvian Amazon where the only highways are rivers and to getfrom point A to point B may take five
 hours while with a drone you can get there in 30 minutesso just delivering drugs retrieving
 samples for for testing vaccines I think there's huge potential here so Ithink if the challenges are not
 technological that the challenge is economical the one thing I'll tell youthat nobody thinks about is the fact
 that we've not made huge strides in battery technology yes it's truebatteries are becoming less expensive
 because we have these mega factories that are coming up but they're all basedon lithium based technologies and if you
 look at the energy density and the power density those are two fundamentallylimiting numbers so power density is
 important because for a UAV to take off vertically into the air which mostdrones do they're not they don't have a
 runway you consume roughly two and watts per kilo at the small size that'sa lot right in contrast the human brain
 consumes less than 80 watts the whole of the human brain so just imagine justlifting yourself into the air is like
 two or three lightbulbs which makes no sense to me yes so you're going to have

Speaker 1 :to at scale solve the energy problem
 then charging the batteries storing the the energy and so on and then the

Speaker 0 :storage is the second problem but
 storage limits the range but you know you you you have to remember that youyou have to you have to burn a lot of it
 for a given time so the turning which is the pop which is a power question yes

Speaker 1 :and do you think just your intuition
 there there are breakthroughs in batteries on the horizon how hard isthat problem look there are a lot of


Speaker 0 :companies that are promising flying cars
 but there are autonomous and that are cleanI think there over-promising the
 autonomy piece is durable the clean piece I don't think sothere's another company that I work with
 called jet otra they make small jet engines hmm and they can get up to 50miles an hour very easily and left 50
 kilos but their jet engines they're efficient there are little louder thanelectric vehicles but they can bail
 flying cars so your sense is that

Speaker 1 :there's a lot of pieces that have come
 together so on this crazy question if you look at companies like Kitty Hawkworking on electrics of clean I'm
 talking to Sebastian Thrun right it's a it's a crazy dream you know but you workwith flight a lot
 you've mentioned before that manned flights are carrying of the human bodyis very difficult to do so how crazy is
 flying cars do you think there will be a day when we have vertical takeoff andlanding vehicles that are sufficiently
 affordable that we're going to see a huge amount of them and they would looklike something like we dream of when we
 think about flying cars yeah like the

Speaker 0 :Jetsons The Jetsons yeah so look there
 are a lot of smart people working on this and you never say something is notpossible when you're people like
 Sebastian Thrun working on it so I totally think it's viable Iquestion again the electric piece they
 let you pee on it and again for short distances you can do it and there's noreason to suggest that these are all
 just have to be rotorcraft you take off vertically but the new morph into aforward flight I think there are a lot
 of interesting designs the question to me is is are these economically viableand if you agree to do this with fossil
 fuels that instinct immediately becomes

Speaker 1 :viable that's a real challenge do you
 think it's possible for robots and humans to collaborate successfully ontasks so a lot of robotics folks that I
 talk to and work with I mean humans just add a giant mess tothe picture so it's best to remove them
 from consideration when solving specific tasks it's very difficult to modelthere's just a source of uncertainty in
 your work with these agile flying robots do you think there's a role forcollaboration with humans or is it best
 to model tasks in a way that that doesn't have a human in the picture well

Speaker 0 :I I don't think we should ever think
 about robots without human in the picture ultimately robots are therebecause we want them to solve problems
 for humans right but there is no general solution to this problem I think if youlook at human interaction and how humans
 interact with robots you know we think of these in three different ways one isthe human commanding the robot the
 second is the human collaborating with the robot so for example we work on howa robot can actually pick up things with
 a human will carry things that's like true collaboration and third we thinkabout humans as by standards so driving
 cars what's the human's role and how does how do self-driving carsacknowledge the presence of humans so I
 think all of these things are different scenarios it depends on what kind ofhumans were kind of tasks and I think
 it's very difficult to say that there's a general theory that we all have forthis but at the same time it's also
 silly to say that we we should think about robots independent of humans so tome human robot interaction is almost a
 mandatory aspect of everything we do yes

Speaker 1 :so but the Jewish to agree so with your
 thoughts if you jump to autonomous vehicles for example there's a there's abig debate between what's called level 2
 and level 4 so semi autonomous and autonomous vehicles instead of the Teslaapproach currently at least has a lot of
 collaboration between human and machine so the human is supposed to activelysupervise the operation of the robot the
 part of the safety a definition of how safe a robot is inthat case is how effective is the human
 and monitoring it do you think that's ultimately not a good approach in sortof having a human in the picture not as
 a bystander or part of the infrastructure but really as part ofwhat's required to make the system safe


Speaker 0 :this is harder than it sounds yes I
 think you know if you if you if I mean I'm sure you've driven the driven beforeand highways and so on it's it's really
 very hard to have to relinquish controls to a machine and then take over whenneeded so I think Tesla's approach is
 interesting because it allows you to periodically establish some kind ofcontact with the car Toyota on the other
 hand is thinking about shared autonomy as a collaborative autonomy as aparadigm if I may argue these are very
 very simple ways of human-robot collaboration because the task is prettyboring you sit in a vehicle you go from
 point A to point B I think the more interesting thing to me is for examplesearch-and-rescue I've got a human first
 responder robot first responders I got to do something it's important I have todo it in two minutes the building is
 burning there's been an explosion it's collapsed how do I do it I think to methose are the interesting things where
 it's very very unstructured and what's the role of the human was the role robotclearly there's lots of interesting
 challenges and as a field I think we're gonna make a lot of progress in thisarea yeah it's an exciting form of


Speaker 1 :collaboration you're right in the town
 was driving the main enemy is just boredom of the human yes as opposed toin rescue operations
 it's literally life and death and the collaboration enables the effectivecompletion of the mission so exciting in


Speaker 0 :some sense you know we're also doing
 this you think about the human driving a car and almost invariably the humanstrying to estimate the state of the cars
 estimate the state of the environment so on but what if the car were to estimatethe state of the human
 so for example I'm sure you have a smartphone the smartphone tries tofigure out what you're doing and send
 you reminders and often times telling you to drive to a certain place althoughyou have no intention of going there
 because it thinks that that's why you should be a cause of some gmail calendarentry or something like that and and you
 know it's trying to constantly figure out who you are what you're doing if acar were to do that maybe that would
 make the driver safer because the car's trying to figure out is the driverpaying attention
 looking at his or her eyes looking at saccadic movements so I think thepotential is there but from the reverse
 side it's not robot modeling but it's human modeling it's more in the human

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :right and I think the robots can do a
 very good job of modeling humans if you if you really think about the frameworkthat you have a human sitting in a in a
 cockpit surrounded by sensors all staring at him in addition to be staringout staring outside but also staring at
 him I think there's a real synergy there yeah I love that problem because it's a

Speaker 1 :new 21st century form of psychology
 actually AI enabled psychology a lot of people have sci-fi inspired fears ofwalking robots like those from Boston
 Dynamics if you just look at shows on Netflix and so on or flying robots likethose you work with how would you how do
 you think about those fears how would you alleviate those fears doyou have Inklings echos of those same
 concerns you know anytime we develop a

Speaker 0 :technology meaning to have positive
 impact in the world there's always a worry that you know somebody couldsubvert those technologies and use it in
 an adversarial setting and robotics is no exception right so I think it's veryeasy to weaponize robots I think we
 talked about swarms one thing I worry a lot about is so you know for us to getswamps to work and do something reliably
 it's really hard but suppose I have there's this challenge of trying todestroy something and I have a swarm of
 robots well only one out of the swarm needs to get to its destination so thatsuddenly becomes a lot more doable
 worry about you know this gentle idea of using autonomy with lots and lots ofagents
 I mean having said that looked a lot of this technology is not very mature myfavorite saying is that if somebody had
 to develop this technology wouldn't you rather the good guys do itso the good guys have a good
 understanding of the technology so they can figure out how this technology isbeing used in a bad way or could be used
 in a bad way and try to defend against it so we think a lot about that so wehave a were doing research on how to
 defend against swarms for example that's a there's in fact a report by theNational Academies on counter UAS
 technologies this is a real threat but we're also thinking about how to defendagainst this and and knowing how swarms
 work knowing how autonomy works is I think very important so it's not just

Speaker 1 :politicians you think engineers have a
 role in this discussion absolutely I

Speaker 0 :think the days where politicians can be
 agnostic to technology are gone III think every tech politician needs tobe literate in technology and I often
 say technology is the new liberal art understanding how technology will changeyour life I think is important and every
 human being needs to understand that and

Speaker 1 :maybe we can elect some engineers to
 office as well on the other side what are the biggest open problems inrobotics and you said we're in the early
 days in some sense what are the problems we would like to solve in robotics I

Speaker 0 :think there are lots of problems right
 but I would phrase it in the following way if you look at the robots or abuilding they're still very much
 tailored towards doing specific tasks and specific settings I think thequestion of how do you get them to
 operate in much broader settings with where things can change you knowunstructured environments is up in the
 air so you know think of a self-driving cars today we can build a self-drivingcar in a parking lot we can do level
 fire autonomy in a parking lot but can you do level five autonomy in thestreets of Napoli in Italy or Mumbai in
 India no no so in some sense when we think about robotics we have to thinkabout where they're functioning what
 kind of environment what kind of a task we have no understanding of how to putboth those things together so we're in


Speaker 1 :the very early days of applying it to
 the physical world and I was just enables actually and that's there'slevels of difficulty in complexity
 depending on which area you're applying it to I think so we don't have a

Speaker 0 :systematic way of understanding that you
 know everybody says just because computer can now beat a human at anyboard game we suddenly know something
 about intelligence that's not true a computer board game is very verystructured it is the equivalent of
 working in a Henry Ford factory where things parts come you assemble move onit's a very very very structured setting
 that's the easiest thing and we know how to do that

Speaker 1 :so you've done a lot of incredible work
 at the University of Pennsylvania grasp ah you know Dean of engineering at UPennwhat advice do you have for a new
 bright-eyed undergrad interested in robotics or AI or engineering well I

Speaker 0 :think there's really three things one is
 one is you have to get used to the idea that the world will not be the same infive years or four years whenever you
 graduate right which is really hard to do so this this thing about predictingthe future every one of us needs to be
 trying to predict the future always not because you'll be any good at it but bythinking about it I think you sharpen
 your senses and you become smarter so that's number one number two it's acorollary of the first piece which is
 you really don't know what's going to be important so this idea that I'm going tospecialize in something which will allow
 me to go in a particular direction it may be interesting but it's importantalso to have this breadth so you have
 this jumping-off point I think the third thing and this is where I think Pennexcels I mean we teach engineering but
 it's always in the context of the liberal arts it's always in the contextof society as engineers we cannot afford
 to lose sight of that so I think that's important but I think one thing thatpeople underestimate when they do
 robotics is the important of mathematical foundations important ofrepresent importance of representations
 not everything can just be solved by looking for Ross packages on theinternet or to find a deep neural
 network that works I think the representation question iskey even to machine learning where if
 you hope ever hope to achieve or get to explainable AI somehow there need to berepresentations that you can understand
 so if you want to do robotics you should

Speaker 1 :also do mathematics and you said liberal
 arts a little literature if you want to build it all I should be readingDostoyevsky I agree with that very good
 the v-j thank you so much for talking today was an honor thank you it's just
