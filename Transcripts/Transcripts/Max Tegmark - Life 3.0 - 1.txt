Speaker 1 :as part of MIT course six as $0.99
 artificial general intelligence I've gotten the chance to sit down with maxtegmark he is a professor here at MIT is
 a physicist spent a large part of his career studying the mysteries of ourcosmological universe but he's also
 studied and delved into the beneficial possibilities and the existential risksof artificial intelligence amongst many
 other things he's the co-founder of the

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :future of life Institute author of two
 books both of which I highly recommend first our Mathematica universesecond is life 3.0 he's truly an
 out-of-the-box thinker and fun personality so I really enjoyed talkingto him if you would like to see more of
 these videos in the future please subscribe and also click the little bellicon to make sure you don't miss any
 videos also Twitter linked in AGI that MIT that I do if you want to watch otherlectures or conversations like this one
 better yet go read Max's book life 3.0 chapter 7 on goals is my favorite it'sreally where philosophy and engineer and
 come together and it opens with a quote by dusty s key the mystery of humanexistence lies not and just stayin alive
 but in finding something to live for lastly I believe that every failurerewards us with an opportunity to learn
 in that sense I've been very fortunate to fail in so many new and exciting waysand this conversation was no different
 I've learned about something called radio frequency interference or RFI lookit up
 apparently music and conversations from local radio stations can bleed into theaudio that you're recording in such a
 way that almost completely ruins that audio it's an exceptionally difficult

Speaker 0 :sound source to remove so I've gotten


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the opportunity to learn how to avoid


Speaker 1 :RFI in the future during recording
 sessions of also gotten the opportunity to learn how to use Adobe Auditionand isotope rx6 to do some noise some


Speaker 0 :audio repair


Speaker 1 :of course this is exceptionally
 difficult noise to remove I am an engineer I'm not an audio engineerneither is anybody else in our group but
 we did our best nevertheless I thank you for yourpatience and I hope you're still able to


Speaker 2 :enjoy this conversation do you think
 there's intelligent life out there in the universelet's open up with an easy question I


Speaker 0 :have a lien minority of you here


Speaker 1 :actually when I give public lectures
 Alfred asked for show of hands who thinks there's intelligent life outthere somewhere else and almost everyone
 put their hands up and when I ask why they'll be like oh there's so many

Speaker 0 :galaxies out there there's gonna be but


Speaker 1 :I'm a numbers nerd right so when you
 look more carefully at it it's not so clear at all if we when we talk aboutour universe first of all we don't mean
 all of space did we actually mean I don't you can throw me in the universeif she wants behind you there it's we
 simply mean the spherical region of

Speaker 0 :space from which light has a time to


Speaker 1 :reach us so far during the fourteen
 point eight billion year 13.8 billion years since our Big Bang there's morespace here but this is what we call a
 universe because that's all we have access to mm-hmm so is there intelligentlife here that's gotten to the point of


Speaker 0 :building telescopes and computers my


Speaker 1 :guess is no actually no the probability


Speaker 0 :of it happening on any given planet is


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :some number we don't know what it is and


Speaker 1 :what we do know is that the number can't
 be super-high because there's over a billion earth-like planets in the MilkyWay galaxy alone many of which are


Speaker 0 :billions of years older than Earth and


Speaker 1 :aside from some UFO believers in other
 reason is much evidence that any super 20 civilization has come here at all andso that's the famous Fermi paradox right
 and then if you if you work the numbers what you find is that if you have noclue what the probability is of getting


Speaker 0 :life on a given planet


Speaker 1 :could be 10 to the minus 10 and the
 minus 20 or 10 minus to any power tensor equally likely if you want to be reallyopen-minded that translates into it
 being equally likely that our nearest neighbor is 10 to the 16 meters away 10

Speaker 0 :to the 17 meters away 10 to the 18 now
 by the time he gets much less than than

Speaker 1 :10 to the 16 already we pretty much know


Speaker 0 :there is nothing else that's close and


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :when you get the other would have


Speaker 1 :discovered us they yeah they would have
 been discovered as long or if they're really close we would have probably knowthat some engineering projects that
 they're doing and if it's beyond 10 to the 26 meters that's already outside ofhere so my guess is actually that there


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :are we are the only life in here they've
 gotten the point of building advanced

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :tech which i think is very um puts a lot


Speaker 1 :of responsibility on our shoulders not
 screw up you know I think people who take for granted that it's okay for usto screw up have an accident in a
 nuclear war or go extinct somehow because there's a star trek-likesituation out there with some other life
 forms are gonna come and bail us out and doesn't matters what I think they'relulling us into a false sense of
 security I think it's much more prudent to say you know let's be really gratefulfor this amazing opportunity we've had


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and make the best of it just in case it


Speaker 2 :is down to us so from a physics
 perspective do you think intelligent life so it's unique from a sort ofstatistical view of the size of the
 universe but from the basic matter of the universe how difficult is it forintelligent life to come about the kind
 of advanced tech building life I in is implied in your statement that is reallydifficult to create something like a


Speaker 1 :human species well I think I think what
 we know is that going from no life to having life that can do ARCA a level oftech there's some sort of - going beyond
 that than actually settling our whole universe with life there is some road

Speaker 0 :major roadblock there which is


Speaker 1 :great filter as that's sometimes called
 which which tough to get through it's either that roadblock is either beefbehind us or in front of us I'm hoping
 very much that it's behind us I'm super excited every time we get a new reportfrom NASA saying they failed to find any
 life on Mars like just awesome because that suggeststhat the hard part maybe what maybe he
 was getting the first ribosome or or

Speaker 0 :some some very low-level kind of


Speaker 1 :stepping stone so they were home free
 cuz if that's true then the future is really only limited by our ownimagination it'd be much luckier if it


Speaker 0 :turns out that this level of life is


Speaker 1 :kind of a dime a dozen but maybe there
 is some other problem like as soon as a civilization gets advanced technologywithin a hundred years they get into
 some stupid fight with themselves and poof yeah no that would be a bummer

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 2 :yeah so you've explored the mysteries of
 the universe the cosmological universe the one that's sitting between us todayI think you've also begun to explore the
 other universe which is sort of the mystery the mysterious universe of themind of intelligence of intelligent life
 so is there a common thread between your interest or in the way you think aboutspace and intelligence oh yeah when I


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :was a teenager yeah I was already very


Speaker 1 :fascinated by the biggest questions and
 I felt that the two biggest quite mysteries of all in science where ouruniverse out there and our universe in
 here yeah so it's quite natural after

Speaker 0 :having spent a quarter of a century on


Speaker 1 :my career thinking a lot about this one
 I'm now indulging in the luxury of doing research on this one it's just so cool I

Speaker 0 :feel the time is right now for you


Speaker 1 :Trane's greatly deepening our


Speaker 2 :understanding of this just start
 exploring this one yeah because I think

Speaker 1 :I think a lot of people view


Speaker 0 :intelligence as something mysterious


Speaker 1 :that can only exist and biological
 organisms like us and therefore dismiss all talk about artificial generalintelligence is science fiction
 but from my perspective as a physicist you know I am a blob of quarks andelectrons moving around in a certain
 pattern and processing information in certain ways and this is also a blob ofquarks and electrons
 I am NOT smarter than the water bottle because I'm made of different kind ofworks I'm made of up quarks and down
 quarks exact same kind as this it's a

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :there's no secret sauce I think in me
 it's all about the pattern of the

Speaker 0 :information processing and this means


Speaker 1 :that there's no law of physics saying
 the way that we can't create technology

Speaker 0 :which can have helped us by being


Speaker 1 :incredibly intelligent and helped us
 crack mysteries that we couldn't in other words I think we really only seenthe tip of the intelligence iceberg so


Speaker 2 :far yeah so the perceptron ium yeah so
 you can't go in this amazing term it's a hypothetical state of matter sort ofthinking from a physics perspective what
 is the kind of matter that can help as you're saying a subjective experienceemerged consciousness emerge so how do
 you think about consciousness from this

Speaker 0 :physics perspective very good question
 so again I think many people have underestimated our ability to makeprogress on this and by convincing


Speaker 1 :themselves it's hopeless because somehow


Speaker 0 :we're missing some ingredient that we


Speaker 1 :need or some new consciousness particle


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :or whatever I happen to think that we're
 not missing anything and and that it's or not the interesting thing aboutconsciousness that gives us this amazing
 subjective experience of colors and

Speaker 0 :sounds and emotions and so on is rather


Speaker 1 :something at the higher level about the
 patterns of information processing

Speaker 0 :that's why that's why I am like to think


Speaker 1 :about this idea of perceptron Neum what
 does it mean for an arbitrary physical system to be conscious in terms of whatits particles are doing or its
 information is doing I don't think I don't hate carbon chauvinism you knowthis attitude you have to be made of
 carbon atoms to be smart or conscious

Speaker 2 :something about the information
 processing yes kind of matter performs

Speaker 1 :yeah and you know yeah I have my
 favorite equations here describing various fundamental aspects of the worldI feel that I think one day maybe
 someone who's watching this will come up with the equations that informationprocessing has to satisfy to be
 conscious I'm quite convinced there is big discovery to be made there yeah

Speaker 0 :because let's face it sumit we know that


Speaker 1 :some information processing is conscious


Speaker 0 :because we are yeah conscious but we


Speaker 1 :also know that a lot of information
 processing is not conscious like most of the information processing happening inyour brain right now is not conscious
 there is like 10 megabytes per second coming in and even just through yourvisual system you are not conscious
 about your heartbeat regulation or or most things by even even like if I justask you to like read what it says here
 you look at it and then oh now you know what it said but you don't aware of howthe computation actually happened you're
 like the your consciousness is like the CEO that got an email at the end we

Speaker 0 :leave with a final answer so what is it


Speaker 1 :that makes the difference I think that's
 a both of us great science mystery we're actually starting it a little bit in mylab here at MIT but I also I think it's
 just a really urgent question the answer for started I mean if you're anemergency room doctor and you have an
 unresponsive patient coming in and wouldn't it be great if in addition to

Speaker 0 :having a CT scan


Speaker 1 :you had a consciousness scanner mm-hmm
 that could figure out whether this person is actually having locked-insyndrome or is actually comatose and in
 the future imagine if we build the

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :robots or the machine that we can have


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :really good conversations which I think
 it's mostly very likely to happen right wouldn't you want to know like if yourhome helped a robot is actually
 experiencing anything or just like a zombie I mean would you prefer whatwould you prefer would you prefer that
 it's actually unconscious so that you don't have to feel guilty aboutswitching it off or giving me boring


Speaker 0 :chores or would you prefer


Speaker 2 :well the certainly would we would prefer
 I would prefer the appearance of consciousnessbut the question is whether the
 appearance of consciousness is different than cost consciousness itself and sortof ask that as a question yeah do you
 think we need to you know understand what consciousness is solve the hardproblem of consciousness in order to
 build something like an a GI system no I

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :don't think that and I think we we will


Speaker 1 :probably be able to build things even if
 we don't answer that question but if we want to make sure that what happens is agood thing we better solve it first so
 it's a wonderful controversy you're raising there there where you havebasically three points of view about the


Speaker 0 :heart problem sir there are two


Speaker 1 :different points of view that both
 conclude that the hard problem of

Speaker 0 :consciousness is BS you're on one hand


Speaker 1 :you have some people like Daniel Dennett
 who say this is our consciousness is just BS because consciousness is thesame thing as intelligence there's no
 difference so anything which acts

Speaker 0 :conscious is conscious just like like we


Speaker 1 :are and then there are also a lot of
 people including many top AI researchers I know you say all conscience is just because of course machines
 should never be conscious tonight they're always gonna is gonna be zombiesnever have to feel guilty about how you


Speaker 0 :treat them and then there's a third


Speaker 1 :group of people including Giulio Tononi
 for example and and another just of chakana brothersI would put myself Falls on this middle
 camp who say that actually some information processing is conscious andin some is not so let's find the
 equation which can be used to determine

Speaker 0 :which it is and I think we've just been


Speaker 1 :a little bit lazy kind of running away
 from this problem for a long time it's been almost taboo would even mention thec-word a lot of circles because look but


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :we should stop making excuses this is a
 science question and we can the rock

Speaker 0 :there are ways we can even test test any


Speaker 1 :theory that makes predictions for this
 and coming back to this helper robot I mean so you said you'd want to help arobot to certainly act conscious and
 treat you like to have conversations with us I think so wouldn't you wouldyou feel would you feel a little bit
 creeped out if you realize that it was just glossed up the tape recorder theyknow there was just Sambi and there's
 some faking emotion would you prefer that it actually had an experience orwill you prefer that it's actually not
 experiencing anything so you feel you don't have to feel guilty about what you

Speaker 2 :do to it it's such a difficult question
 because you know it's like when you're in a relationship and you say well Ilove you and the other person I love you
 back it's like asking well do they really love you back or are they justsaying they love you back
 do you don't you really want them to actually love you I it's hard to it'shard to really know the difference
 between everything seeming like there's consciousness present there'sintelligence present there's affection
 passion love and and actually being there I'm not sure do you have a

Speaker 1 :question let's just like to make it a
 bit more pointed so Mass General Hospital is right across the river rightyes suppose suppose you're going in for


Speaker 0 :a medical procedure and they're like you


Speaker 1 :know
 furnish the agent what we're gonna do is we're gonna give you a muscle relaxantso you won't be able to move and you're
 gonna feel excruciating pain during the whole surgery but you won't be able todo anything about it but then we're
 gonna give you this drug that erases

Speaker 0 :your memory of it would you be cool
 about that no what

Speaker 1 :difference that you're conscious about


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :it or not if there's no behavioral


Speaker 2 :change right right that's a really
 that's a really clear way to put it that's yeah it feels like in that senseexperiencing it is a valuable quality so
 actually being able to have subjective experiences at least in that cases is

Speaker 0 :valuable and I think we humans have a


Speaker 1 :little bit of a bad track record also of
 making these self-serving arguments that other entities aren't conscious you knowpeople often say oh these animals can't
 feel pain right it's okay to boil lobsters because we asked them if ithurt and they didn't say anything and
 now there was just the paper out saying lobsters did do feel pain when you boilthem and they're banning it in
 Switzerland it and and we did this with slaves too often and say oh they don'tmind they don't maybe or aren't


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :conscious or women don't have souls or
 whatever I'm a little bit nervous when I hear people just take as an axiom that

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :machines can't have experience ever I
 think this is just this really fascinating science question is what itis
 let's research it and try to figure out what it is it makes the differencebetween
 unconscious intelligent behavior and conscious intelligent behavior so in

Speaker 2 :terms of so if you think of a Boston
 Dynamics human robot being sort of with a broom being pushed around the itsstarts it starts pushing on his
 consciousness question so let me ask do you think an AGI system like a fewneuroscientists believe needs to have a
 physical embodiment needs to have a body

Speaker 0 :or something like a body no I don't


Speaker 1 :think so you mean to have to have a
 conscious experience to have

Speaker 2 :

Speaker 0 :consciousness I do think it helps a lot


Speaker 1 :to have a physical embodiment learn the
 kind of things about the world that

Speaker 0 :they're important to us humans for sure
 but I don't think

Speaker 1 :bah diamond is necessary after you've
 learned it just have the experience think about when you're dreaming right

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :your eyes are closed you're not getting
 any sensory input you're not behaving or moving in any way but there's still an

Speaker 0 :experience there right and so there's


Speaker 1 :clearly the experience that you have
 when you see something tool in your dreams isn't coming from your eyes it'sjust the information processing itself


Speaker 0 :in your brain which is that experience


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 2 :right but if I put another way I'll say
 because it comes from neuroscience is the reason you want to have a body and aphysical something like a physical like
 a you know a physical system is because you want to be able to preservesomething in order to have a self you


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 2 :could argue would you you need to have
 some kind of embodiment of self to want

Speaker 0 :to preserve well now we're getting a


Speaker 1 :little bit on Drop amorphic that's inter
 and super more fising things miss Mamie tossing like self-preservation instinctsI mean we are evolved organisms right


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :right so Darwinian evolution endowed us
 and other involve all organism with the self-preservation instinct as those thatdidn't have those self-preservation
 genes are clean out of the gene pool right right but if you build anartificial general intelligence the mind
 space that you can design is much much larger than just a specific subset ofminds that can evolve that happen so
 they CERN a GI mind doesn't necessarily have to have any self-preservationinstinct it also doesn't necessarily
 have to be so individualistic as I'd like imagine if you could just first ofall it or we're also very afraid of
 death you know I suppose you could back yourself up every five minutes and thenyour airplane is about to crash you like
 shucks I'm just counted I'm gonna lose

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :the last five minutes of experiences
 it's my last cloud backup you're dying you know it's not this big a deal or ifwe could just copy experiences between
 our minds easily like me which we could easily do if we were silicon based right

Speaker 0 :then
 maybe we would feel a little bit more

Speaker 1 :like a hive mind actually but maybe is
 he so so there's a so I don't think we should take for granted at all that AG I

Speaker 0 :will have to have any of those sort of


Speaker 1 :competitive as alpha male instincts


Speaker 0 :right on the other hand you know this is


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :really interesting because I think some


Speaker 1 :people go too far and say oh of course
 we don't have to have any concerns

Speaker 0 :either that advanced AI will have those


Speaker 1 :instincts because we can build anything
 you want that there's there's a very nice set of arguments going back toSteve Omohundro and Nick Bostrom and


Speaker 0 :others just pointing out that when we
 build machines we normally build them

Speaker 1 :with some kind of goal you know win this
 chess game drive this car safely or whatever and as soon as you put in agoal into machine especially if it's
 kind of open-ended goal and the machine is very intelligent it'll break that

Speaker 0 :down into a bunch of sub goals and one


Speaker 1 :of those gold will almost always be
 self-preservation because if it breaks or dies in the process it's not gonnaaccomplish the goal right like suppose
 you just build a little you have a little robot and you tell it to go downthe Starmark get here and and and get
 you some food make your cookin Italian dinner you know and then someone mugs itand tries to break it down the way that
 robot has an incentive to not destroy it and defend itself or run away becauseotherwise it's gonna fail and cooking
 you dinner it's not afraid of death but

Speaker 0 :it really wants to complete the dinner


Speaker 1 :cooking gold so it will have a
 self-preservation instinct continue

Speaker 2 :

Speaker 1 :being a functional Asian yeah and and


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :similarly if you give any kind of warm
 and they she's go to an AGI it's very likely they want to acquiremore resources so it can do that better
 and it's exactly from those sort of sub goals that we might not have intendedthat but some of the concerns about AGI
 safety come you give it some goal which

Speaker 0 :seems completely harmless and then
 before you realize it it's also trying

Speaker 1 :to do these other things which you
 didn't want it to do and it's moment be smarter than us so so lastly and let me

Speaker 2 :pause just because I
 in a very kind of human centric way see fear of death is a valuable motivatorhaha so you don't think do you think


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 2 :that's an artifact of evolution so
 that's the kind of mind space evolution created they were sort of almostobsessed about self-preservation kind of
 genetic well you don't think that's

Speaker 0 :necessary to be afraid of death so not


Speaker 2 :just a kind of sub goal of
 self-preservation just so you can keep doing the thing but more fundamentallysort of have the finite thing like this
 ends for you at some point the

Speaker 1 :interesting do I think it's necessary
 before what precisely for intelligence

Speaker 2 :but also for consciousness so for those
 for both do you think really like a finite death and the fear of it is

Speaker 0 :important so before I can answer well


Speaker 1 :before we can agree on whether it's
 necessary for intelligence or for consciousness we should be clear or howwe define those two words because share
 a lot of really smart people to find them in very different ways I was inthis on this panel and with AI experts
 and they couldn't they couldn't agree on how to define intelligence even so Idefine intelligence simply as the
 ability to accomplish complex goals I like your broad definition becauseagain I don't want to be a carbon


Speaker 0 :chauvinist right and in that case no it


Speaker 1 :certainly certainly doesn't require fear
 of death I would say alpha go alpha zero is quite intelligentI don't think alpha zero has any fear of
 being turned off because it doesn't understand the concept of that even andand similarly consciousness I mean you
 could certainly imagine very simple kind of experience if you know if certainplants have any kind of experience I
 don't think they were afraid of dying if there's nothing they can do about itanyway much so there wasn't that much


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :value and but more seriously I think if


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you ask not just about being conscious


Speaker 0 :but maybe having what you would


Speaker 1 :we might call an exciting life for you
 feel passion and I didn't really

Speaker 0 :appreciate the little things maybe there


Speaker 1 :but somehow maybe there perhaps it does
 help having having my backdrop today it's finite you know let's let's makethe most of this this live to the
 fullest so if you if you knew you were gonna slip forever if you think you

Speaker 0 :would change your yeah in some


Speaker 2 :perspective it would be an incredibly
 boring life living forever so in the sort of loose subjective terms that yousaid of something exciting and something
 in this that other humans would understand I think is yeah it seems thatthe the finiteness of it is important


Speaker 1 :well the good news I have for you then
 is based on what we understand about

Speaker 0 :cosmology everything is in our universe
 is Pro ultimately probably finite alone

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :although pay crunch or bit or big what's
 to expand anything yeah we couldn't have

Speaker 1 :a Big Chill or a Big Crunch or a big rip
 or that's the big snap or death bubbles all over more than a billion years awayso we should we certainly have vastly
 more time than our ancestors thought but

Speaker 0 :there is still it's still pretty hard to


Speaker 1 :squeeze in an infinite number of compute


Speaker 0 :cycles even though there are some


Speaker 1 :loophole let's just might be possible


Speaker 0 :but I think I you know some people like


Speaker 1 :to say that you should live as if you're
 about you're gonna die in five years or something that sort of optimal maybe

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :it's a good it subs we should build our
 civilization as if it's all finite to be

Speaker 2 :on the safe side right exactly so you
 mentioned in defining intelligence as the ability solve complex goals wherewould you draw a line how would you try
 to define human level intelligence and superhuman level intelligence where thisconsciousness part of that definition no


Speaker 1 :consciousness does not come into this
 definition so so I think your intelligence is it's a spectrum butthere are very many different kinds of
 goals you can have you can have a goal to be a good chess player a good goalplayer a good car driver


Speaker 0 :a good investor good poet etc so


Speaker 1 :intelligence that bind by its very
 nature isn't something you can measure but it's one number overall goodness nono there are some people who are more
 better at this some people are better than that um right now we have machinesthat are much better than us at some


Speaker 0 :very narrow tasks like multiplying large


Speaker 1 :numbers fast memorizing large databases
 playing chess playing go and soon driving cars but there's still nomachine that can match a human child in
 general intelligence but but artificial general intelligence AGI in the name of

Speaker 0 :your course of course that is by its


Speaker 1 :very definition the the quests the build
 a mission in seen that can do everything as well as we can up to the old holygrail of AI from from back to its
 inception and then 60s if that ever happens of course I think it's gonna bethe biggest transition in the history of
 life on earth but it but it doesn't

Speaker 0 :necessarily have to wait the big impact


Speaker 1 :about until machines are better than us
 at knitting the really big change

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :doesn't come exactly the moment they're
 better than us at everything

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :the really big change comes first there
 big changes when they start becoming better at us at doing most of the jobsthat we do because that's it can takes
 away much of the demand for human labor and then the really whopping changecomes when they become better than us at


Speaker 0 :AI research right right because right


Speaker 1 :now the timescale of AI researcher is


Speaker 0 :limited by the human research and


Speaker 1 :development cycle of years typically at
 all along the tape from one release of some software or iPhone or whatever to

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :the next but once once we have once
 Google can replace 40,000 engineers by

Speaker 0 :40,000 equivalent pieces of software or


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :whatever right then that doesn't there's


Speaker 1 :no reason that has to be years it can be
 in principle much faster and the timescale of future progress in AI andalso all of science and technology will
 will be driven by machines not

Speaker 0 :so it's this point simple point which


Speaker 1 :lives right this incredibly fun
 controversy about whether it can be an intelligence explosion so-calledsingularities Vernor Vinge called it
 that the idea is articulated by IJ good obviously way back fifties but you cansee Alan Turing and others thought about


Speaker 0 :it even earlier not did you ask me what


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :exactly what I define England's yeah so


Speaker 1 :this the the glib answer is it to say
 something which is better than us at all cognitive tasks will look better thanany human and all cognitive tasks but
 the really interesting bar I think goes a little bit lower than that actuallyit's when they can when they're better
 than us it AI programming and can a general learning so that they can can if

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :they want to get better than I said
 anything by just studying so they're

Speaker 2 :better is a keyword and better as
 towards this kind of spectrum of the complexity of goals it's able toaccomplish yeah so another way to so no
 and that's certainly a very clear definition of human law so there's it'salmost like a sea that's rising you
 could do more and more and more things as a graphic that you show it's reallynice way to put it so there's some Peaks
 that and there's an ocean level elevating and you saw more and moreproblems but you know just kind of to
 take a pause and we took a bunch of questions and a lot of social networksand a bunch of people asked a sort of a
 slightly different direction on creativity and and things like that

Speaker 0 :perhaps aren't a peak the it's you know


Speaker 2 :human beings are flawed and perhaps
 better means having being a having contradiction being fought in some wayso let me sort of yeah
 start and start easy first of all so you have a lot of cool equations let me askwhat's your favorite equation first of
 all I know they're all like your children but like which one is that it's

Speaker 1 :the master key of
 want the mechanics of the microworld this equation to protect you likeeverything to do with atoms molecules


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and all that we have yeah so okay it's a


Speaker 2 :quantum mechanics is certainly a
 beautiful mysterious formulation of our world so I'd like to sort of ask youjust as an example it perhaps doesn't
 have the same beauty as physics does but in mathematics abstract the Andrew Wileswho proved the firm as last theta so he
 just saw this recently and it kind of caught my eye a little bit this is threehundred fifty eight years after it was
 conjectured so this very simple formulation everybody tried to prove iteverybody failed and say here's this guy
 comes along and eventually it proves it and then fails to prove it and proves itagain in 94 and he said like the moment
 when everything connected into place the in an interview said it was soindescribably beautiful that moment when
 you finally realized the connecting piece of two conjectures he said it wasso indescribably beautiful it was so
 simple and so elegant I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I juststared at it in disbelief for twenty
 minutes then then during the day I walked around the department and atKeamy keep coming back to my desk
 looking to see if it was still there it was still there I couldn't containmyself I was so excited it was the most
 important moment on my working life nothing I ever do again will mean asmuch so that particular moment and it
 kind of made me think of what would it take and I think we have all been thereat small levels maybe let me ask have
 you had a moment like that in your life where you just had an ideas like wow yes

Speaker 0 :I wouldn't


Speaker 1 :self and the same breath as Andrew wilds


Speaker 0 :but I've certainly had a number of um
 aha moments mo when I realized something

Speaker 1 :very cool about physics just as


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :completely made my head explode in fact
 some of my favorite discoveries I made later I later realize if they had beendiscovered earlier someone who sometimes
 got quite famous for it so I find this too late for me to even publish it butthat doesn't diminish in any way an
 emotional experience you have when you

Speaker 2 :realize it like yeah Wow yeah
 so what would it take and at that moment that wow that was yours in a moment sowhat do you think it takes for an
 intelligent system and a GI system an AI system to have a moment like that that's

Speaker 0 :a tricky question because there are


Speaker 1 :actually two parts to it right one of


Speaker 0 :them is cannot accomplish that proof it


Speaker 1 :cannot prove that you can never write a


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :to the N plus B to the N equals 3/2 that
 equals e to the N for all integers well

Speaker 0 :etc etc when when n is bigger than 2 the


Speaker 1 :simply in any question about
 intelligence can you build machines that

Speaker 0 :are that intelligent and I think by the


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :time we get a machine that can
 independently come up with that level of

Speaker 1 :proofs probably quite close to AGI the
 second question is a question about

Speaker 0 :consciousness when will we will willins
 how likely is it that such a machine

Speaker 1 :will actually have any experience at all
 as opposed to just being like a zombie

Speaker 0 :and would we expect it to have some sort


Speaker 1 :of emotional response to this or


Speaker 0 :anything at all I can to human emotion


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :work no but when it accomplishes its
 machine goal it did the views it to somehow it's something very positive and

Speaker 0 :right and and sublime and and and and


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :deeply meaningful I would certainly hope


Speaker 1 :that if in the future we do create


Speaker 0 :machines that are our peers or even our


Speaker 1 :dis
 since yeah I would certainly hope that they do have this sort of sublime

Speaker 0 :sublime appreciation of life in a way my


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :absolutely worst nightmare would be that


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :in at some point in the future the


Speaker 1 :distant future maybe I cost much as
 teeming with all this post biological life doing all the seemingly cool stuff

Speaker 0 :and maybe the fun last humans or the


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :time era our species eventually fizzles


Speaker 1 :out we'll be like well that's ok because
 we're so proud of our descendants here

Speaker 0 :and look what I like my most nightmare


Speaker 1 :is that we haven't solved the
 consciousness problem and we haven't realized that these are all the zombiesthey're not aware of anything anymore
 than the tape recorders it has an any kind of experience so the whole thinghas just become a play for empty benches
 that would be like the ultimate zombie apocalypse me III would much rather in

Speaker 0 :that case that we have these beings


Speaker 1 :which just really appreciate how how


Speaker 0 :amazing it is


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :and in that picture what would be the
 role of creativity we had a few people ask about creativity do you think whenyou think about intelligence I mean
 certainly the the story told the beginning of your book involved you knowcreating movies and so on yeah sort of
 making making money you know you can make a lot of money in our modern worldwith music and movies so if you are
 intelligent system you may want to get good at that yeah but that's notnecessarily what I mean by creativity is
 it important on that complex goals where the sea is rising for there to besomething creative creative or am I
 being very human centric and thinking creativity somehow special

Speaker 0 :relative to intelligence my hunch is
 that we should think your creativity

Speaker 1 :simply as an aspect of intelligence and


Speaker 0 :[Music]
 we we have to be very careful with withhuman vanity we had we have this


Speaker 1 :tendency to very often one and say as
 soon as machines can do something we try to diminish it that's a long but that'snot like real intelligence you know
 you're the night trader or there were or

Speaker 0 :this or that or the other thing maybe if


Speaker 1 :we ask ourselves to write down a
 definition of what we actually mean by

Speaker 0 :being creative what we mean by Andrew


Speaker 1 :Wiles what he did there for example
 don't we often mean that someone takes

Speaker 0 :you very unexpected leap mm-hmm it's not


Speaker 1 :like taking feet 573 and multiplying in
 my 224 by justice step of

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :straightforward cookbook like rules


Speaker 0 :right if this you may be making you even


Speaker 1 :make a connection between two things
 that people have never thought was connect very surprising or something

Speaker 0 :like that I think I think this is an


Speaker 1 :aspect of intelligence and this is some
 actually one of the most important

Speaker 0 :aspect of it maybe the reason we humans


Speaker 1 :are tend to be better at it than
 traditional computers is because it's something that comes more naturally ifyou're a neural network then if you're a
 traditional logic gate based computer machineyou know we physically have all these


Speaker 0 :connections and you activate here


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :activator here activate here ping you


Speaker 1 :know I my hunch is that if we ever build


Speaker 0 :a machine where you could just give it


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the task hey hey you say hey you know I


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :just realized that I have I want to


Speaker 1 :travel around the world instead this
 months can you teach my eight a GI course for me and it's like ok I'll doit and it does everything that you would
 have done and they provides us and so yeah that that would in my mind involve

Speaker 2 :a lot of creativity yeah so I had such a
 beautiful way to put it I think we do try to grab grasp at the you know thedefinition of intelligence is everything
 we don't understand how how to build so like so we as humans try to find thingswell that we have on machines don't
 happen maybe creativity is just one of the things one of the words we use todescribe that that's really interesting


Speaker 1 :where to put it out
 think we need to be that defensive I don't think anything good comes out ofsaying oh we're somehow special you know


Speaker 0 :I it's contrariwise there are many


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :examples in history of we're trying to
 pretend that were somehow superior to

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :all other intelligent beings has led the


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :pretty bad results right


Speaker 1 :Nazi Germany they said that they were
 somehow superior to other people today we still do a lot of cruelty to animalsby saying that we're social superiors
 and how and the other they can't feel painslavery was justified by the same kind
 of really weak weak arguments and and I

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :don't think if we actually go ahead and
 build artificial general intelligence it can do things better than us I don'tthink we should try to found our


Speaker 0 :self-worth on some sort of bogus claims


Speaker 1 :of superiority in in terms of our


Speaker 0 :intelligence I think it's we shouldn't


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :stand Joe find our calling and then the


Speaker 1 :meaning of life from from experiences
 that we have right you know I can have I

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :can have very meaningful experiences


Speaker 0 :even if there are other people who are


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :smarter than me you know when I go to


Speaker 1 :faculty meeting here and I was talking
 about something that I certainly realize oh boy he has a Nobel Prize he has aNobel Prize he has no pride I don't have
 what does that make me enjoy life any less or would enjoy talking those people

Speaker 0 :less of course not see my and the


Speaker 1 :contrariwise I I feel very honored and
 privileged to get to interact with with

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :other very intelligent beings that are
 better than me a lot of stuff so I don't think there's any reason why we can'thave the same approach with with
 intelligent machines that's a really

Speaker 2 :interesting so people don't often think
 about that they think about when there's going if there's machines that are moreintelligent you naturally think that
 that's not going to be a beneficial type of intelligence you don't realise itcould be
 you know like peers of Nobel Prizes that that would be just fun to talk with andthey might be clever about certain
 topics and you can have fun having a few

Speaker 1 :drinks with them so well another example
 is we can all relate to it why it doesn't have to be a terrible thing tobe impressed the friends of people are
 even smarter than us all around is when when you and I were both two years old Imean our parents were much more
 intelligent than us right here worked out okay yeah because their goals were

Speaker 0 :aligned with our goals
 yeah and that I think is really the

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :number one T issue we have to solve its


Speaker 1 :value align the value alignment problem
 exactly because people who see too many Hollywood movies with lousy sciencefiction plot lines they worry about the


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :wrong thing right they worry about some


Speaker 0 :machines only turning evil it's not
 malice they wish that the issue probably

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :concerned its competence by definition
 intelligent makes you makes you very

Speaker 1 :competent if you have a more intelligent


Speaker 0 :goal playing mr. computer playing as the


Speaker 1 :less intelligent one and when we define
 intelligence is the ability to accomplish go winning right it's gonnabe the more intelligent one that wins my


Speaker 0 :and if you have a human and then you


Speaker 1 :have an AGI and that's more intelligent
 in all ways and they have different goals guess who's gonna get their wayright so I was just reading about I was
 just reading about this particular rhinoceros species that was drivenextinct just a few years ago bummer is
 looking at this cute picture mommy run

Speaker 0 :oestrus with it's it's child you know
 and why did we humans private extinction

Speaker 1 :wasn't because we were evil Rhino haters
 right as a whole it was just because we our goals weren't aligned with those ofthe rhinoceros and it didn't work out so
 well for the rhinoceros because we were more intelligent right so I think it'sjust so important that if we ever do


Speaker 0 :build AGI before we


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :we have to make sure that it it learns


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :to understand our goals that it adopts
 our goals and it retains those goals so

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :the cool interesting problem there is
 being able us as human beings trying to formulate our values so you know youcould think of the United States
 Constitution as a as a way that people sat down at the time a bunch of whitemen but which is a good example I should
 we should say they formulated the goals for this country and a lot of peopleagree that those goals actually hold up
 pretty well that's an interesting formulation of values and failedmiserably in other ways so for the value
 alignment problem and a solution to it we have to be able to put on paper or inin in a program human values how


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :difficult do you think that is very but


Speaker 1 :it's so important we really have to give
 it our best and it's difficult for two separate reasons there's the technical

Speaker 0 :value alignment problem of figuring out


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :just how to make machines understand our


Speaker 1 :goals adopt them and retain them and


Speaker 0 :then there's a separate part of it the


Speaker 1 :philosophical part whose values anyway


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and since we it's not like we have any
 great consensus on this planet on values how what mechanism should we create themto aggregate and decide okay what's a


Speaker 0 :good compromise right at that second


Speaker 1 :discussion can't this be left the tech
 nerds like myself right that's right and

Speaker 0 :if we refuse to talk about it and then


Speaker 1 :AGI gets built who's gonna be actually
 making the decision about whose values it's gonna be a bunch of dudes and sometech company yeah yeah and are they


Speaker 0 :necessarily - it's it's so


Speaker 1 :representative of all humankind that we
 want to just entrusted to them or they even is uniquely qualified to speak thefuture human happiness just because
 they're good at programming any I I'd much rather have this be a reallyinclusive conversation but do you think


Speaker 2 :it's possible sort of so you create a
 beautiful vision that includes so the diversity cultural diversity and variousspecs on discussing rights freedoms
 human dignity but how hard is it to come to that consensus do you think it'scertainly a really important thing that
 we should all try to do but do you think

Speaker 0 :it's feasible I I think there's no


Speaker 1 :better way to guarantee failure than to
 try to refuse to talk about it or or refuse to try and I also think it's areally bad strategy to say okay let's


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :first have a discussion for a long time
 and then once we reach complete consensus then we'll try to load it intothe Machine know it we shouldn't let


Speaker 0 :perfect be the enemy of good instead we


Speaker 1 :should start with the kindergarten
 ethics - pretty much everybody agrees on and put that into our machines now we'renot doing that even look at the you know
 anyone who builds this passenger

Speaker 0 :aircraft wants it to never under any


Speaker 1 :circumstances fly into a building or
 mountain right yet the September 11 hijackers were able to do that and evenmore embarrassingly you know and that he
 has Lubitz this depressed Germanwings pilot when he flew hispassenger jet into the Alps killing over


Speaker 0 :a hundred people he just told the


Speaker 1 :autopilot to do it he told the freaking
 computer to change the altitude 200 meters and even though it had the GPS

Speaker 0 :maps everything the computer was like


Speaker 1 :okay no so which we should take those


Speaker 0 :very basic values though where the


Speaker 1 :problem is not that we don't agree that


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :maybe the problem is just we've been too
 lazy to try to put it into our machines and make sure but from now on air

Speaker 0 :airplanes will just which all have


Speaker 1 :computers in them but we'll just never
 just refuse to do something like that go into safe modemaybe lock the cockpit door or than here


Speaker 0 :at the airport and and there's so much


Speaker 1 :other technology in our world as well
 now where it's really quite becoming quite timely to put in some sort of verybasic values like this even in cars we


Speaker 0 :were have enough vehicle terrorism


Speaker 1 :attacks by now of you love different


Speaker 0 :trucks and bands into pedestrians that


Speaker 1 :it's not at all a crazy idea to just


Speaker 0 :have that hardwired into the car just


Speaker 1 :yeah there are a lot of there's always
 gonna be people who for some reason want to harm othersmost of those people don't have the
 technical expertise to figure out how to work around something like that so if

Speaker 0 :the car just won't do it


Speaker 1 :it helps it let's start there so there's


Speaker 2 :a lot of that's a great point so not not
 chasing perfect there's a lot of things that a lot that most of the world agreeson yeah and this look there let's start


Speaker 1 :there and and then once we start there
 we'll also get into the habit of having these kind of conversations about okaywhat else should we put in here and I
 have these discussions this should be a

Speaker 2 :gradual process then great so but that
 also means describing these things and describing it to a machineso one thing we had a few conversation
 was Stephen Wolfram I'm not sure if you're familiar with Stephen but yeah I

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :know quite well so he is you know he
 played you know works with a bunch of things but you know cellular automataare these simple computable things these
 computation systems and he kind of mentioned that you know we probably havealready within these systems already
 something that's AGI meaning like we just don't know it because we can't talkto it so if you give me this chance to
 try to try to release form a question out of this is I think it's aninteresting idea to think that we can
 have intelligent systems but we don't know how to describe something to themand they can't communicate with us I
 know you're doing a little bit work an explainable AI trying to get AI toexplain itself so what are your thoughts
 of natural language processing or some kind of other communication how how doesthe AI explain something to us how do we
 explain something to it to machines or you think of it differently so there are

Speaker 0 :two separate parts to your question
 there are them one of them has to do

Speaker 1 :with communication which is super
 interesting you don't get that insect the other is whether we already have AGIbut we just haven't noticed it yeah


Speaker 0 :right there I beg to differ right and


Speaker 1 :don't think there's anything in any
 cellular automaton or anything or the

Speaker 0 :internet itself or whatever that has


Speaker 1 :artificial
 it didn't really do exactly everything we humans can do better I think today ifthe day that happens when that happens
 we will very soon notice we will probably notice even before andifbecause in a very very big way but for


Speaker 2 :the second part though sorry so the
 because you you have this beautiful way to formulating consciousness as as a youknow as information processing you can
 think of intelligence and information processing and this you can think of theentire universe there's these particles
 and these systems roaming around that have this information processing poweryou don't you don't think there is
 something with the power to process information in the way that we human

Speaker 0 :beings do that's out there that that


Speaker 2 :needs to be sort of connected to it
 seems a little bit philosophical perhaps but there's something compelling to theidea that the power is already there
 would you know yes the focus should be more on these I'm being able to

Speaker 0 :communicate with it mhm well I agree
 that that and some in a certain sense

Speaker 1 :the hardware processing power is already


Speaker 0 :out there because our universe itself
 can think of it as being a computer

Speaker 1 :already right it's constantly computing


Speaker 0 :what water waves have evolved the water


Speaker 1 :waves and the river Charles and how to
 move the air molecules around that s Lloyd has pointed out my colleague herethat you can even in a very rigorous way
 think of our entire universe as being a quantum computer it's pretty clear thatour universe supports this amazing
 processing power because you can even the within this physics computer that welive in right we can even build actually
 laptops and stuff so clearly the power is there it's just that most of thecompute power that nature has it's in my
 opinion kind of wasting on boring stuff like simulating yet another ocean wavesomewhere where no one is even looking
 right so in a sense of what life does what we are doing when we buildcomputers is where we channeling all


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :this compute that nature is doing anyway
 into doing things that are more interesting than just yet another oceanwave you know and let's do something
 cool here so the raw hardware power

Speaker 0 :and sherbet and then and even just like


Speaker 1 :computing what's gonna happen for the
 next five seconds in this water ball you know it takes in a ridiculous amount ofcompute if you do it on a human computer
 in yeah this water ball was did it but that doesnot mean this water bottle has AGI and


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :because AGI means it should also be able
 to like have written my book during his interview yes and I don't think it'sjust communication problems as far as
 you know don't think it can do it and

Speaker 2 :other Buddhists say when they watch the
 water and that there is some beauty that there's some depth and being sure thatthey can communicate with communication


Speaker 1 :that's also very important here because
 I mean look part of my job is being a

Speaker 0 :teacher and I know some very intelligent


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :professors even who just have a better


Speaker 1 :hard time communicating they come up
 with all these brilliant ideas but but to communicate with somebody else youhave to also be able to simulate their
 own mind yes and pettite build well enough and understand model of theirmind that you can say things that they


Speaker 0 :will understand and that's quite


Speaker 1 :difficult and that's why today it's so
 frustrating if you have a computer that makes some cancer diagnosis and you askit well why are you saying I should have
 a surgery if it and if they don't know can only reply or I was trained on fiveterabytes of data and this is my


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :diagnosis boop boop beep beep yeah I
 didn't doesn't really instill a lot of confidence right right so I think wehave a lot of work do one on
 communication there so what kind of what

Speaker 2 :kind of I think you're doing a little
 bit work and explainable eh uh yeah what do you think are the most promisingavenues is it mostly about sort of the
 Alexa problem of natural language processing of being able to actually usehuman interpretable methods of
 communication so being able to talk to a system and talk back to you or is theresome more fundamental problems to be


Speaker 1 :solved I think it's all of above human
 the natural language processing is obviously important but they're also

Speaker 0 :more nerdy


Speaker 1 :fundamental problems like if you if you


Speaker 0 :take you play chess


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :mmm I have to give this Paris key when


Speaker 1 :did you learn Russian nobody watching
 papyrus key I talk after the back more people can you teach yourself Russian toTao what amalgam of bills of sim through
 dinner Wow but I would see languages do you

Speaker 2 :know
 wow that's really impressive I've had

Speaker 1 :some contact base but my point was if
 you play chess but you have you looked at the alpha zero games there are the

Speaker 2 :actual games now just checking out some


Speaker 1 :of them are just mind-blowing really


Speaker 0 :beautiful and if you ask how did it do
 that you got that talk to them is hassabis I

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :know others from beef mine all they will


Speaker 1 :ultimately be able to give you is big


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :tables of numbers matrices that define
 the neural networking and you can stare at these know people's numbers till yourface turned blue and it's you know I can


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :understand much about why it made that
 move and even if you have a natural language processing that can tell you inhuman language about all five seven
 points to eight still not gonna really

Speaker 0 :help so I think think there's a whole


Speaker 1 :spectrum of a fun challenge they're


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :involved in and taking a computation
 that does intelligent things and

Speaker 0 :transforming me into something equally


Speaker 1 :good equally intelligent but it's more
 understandable and I think that's really

Speaker 0 :valuable because I think as we put


Speaker 1 :machines in charge of evermore
 infrastructure in our world the power

Speaker 0 :grid the trading on the stock market
 weapons systems and so on it's absolutely crucial that we can

Speaker 1 :trust these a is a do or I want and
 trust really comes from understanding

Speaker 0 :all right in a very fundamental way and


Speaker 1 :that's why I'm that's why I'm working on
 this because I think the more if we're gonna have some hope of ensuring thatmachines have adopted our goals and that


Speaker 0 :they're gonna retain them that kind of
 trust and

Speaker 1 :thank you needs to be based on things
 you can actually understand preferably even make it perfectly to improvetheorems on even with a self-driving car


Speaker 0 :right if someone just tells you it's


Speaker 1 :been trained on tons of data and I never
 crashed it's it's less reassuring than if someone actually has a proof maybeit's a computer verified proof but still
 it says that under no circumstances is this car just gonna swerve into oncomingtraffic and that kind of information


Speaker 2 :helps will build trust and build the
 alignment the alignment of goals the at least awareness that your goals your

Speaker 1 :values are aligned and I think even a
 very short term if you look at her you know that today right this absolutelypathetic state of cybersecurity that we
 have when it's or is it three billion

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :yahoo accounts which are packed almost


Speaker 1 :every American's credit card and so on
 you know it's why is this happening it's ultimately happening because we havesoftware took nobody fully understood


Speaker 0 :how it worked that's why the bugs hadn't


Speaker 1 :been found right now and I think AI can
 be used very effectively for offense for hacking but it can also be used for

Speaker 0 :defense know hopefully automating


Speaker 1 :verifiability and creating is systems


Speaker 0 :that are built in different


Speaker 1 :so you can actually prove things about
 them right and it's it's important

Speaker 2 :so speaking of software that nobody
 understands how it works of course a bunch of people asked by your paperabout your thoughts of why does deep and
 cheap learning work so well that's the paper but what what are your thoughts ondeep learning these kind of simplified
 models of our own brains have been able to do some successful perception workpattern recognition work and now with
 alpha zero and so on do some some clever things what are your thoughts about thepromise limitations of this piece great


Speaker 0 :I think there are a number of very


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :important insights very important


Speaker 1 :lessons we can already draw from these


Speaker 0 :kind of successes one of them is when


Speaker 1 :you look at the human brain you see it's
 very complicated a tenth of eleven neurons and there are all thesedifferent kinds of neurons and
 yadda-yadda and there's been a long debate about whether the fact that wehave dozens of different kinds is
 actually necessary for intelligence

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :which a now I think quite convincingly
 answer that question no it's enough to

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :have just one kind if you look under the
 hood of alpha zero there's only one kind of neuron and it's ridiculously simple asimple mathematical thing so it's it's
 not the it's just like in physics it's not the D if you have a gas with wavesin it it's not the detailed nature of


Speaker 0 :the molecule the matter it's the


Speaker 1 :collective behavior or somehow it


Speaker 0 :similarly it's it's it's this


Speaker 1 :higher-level structure of the network
 that matters not that you have twenty guys I think whom our brain is such acomplicated mess because it wasn't


Speaker 0 :devolved just to be intelligent it was


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :evolved to also be self assembling right


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :and self repairing right and


Speaker 1 :evolutionarily attainable matches and so


Speaker 2 :

Speaker 1 :on yeah so I think it's pretty my my
 hunch is that we're gonna understand how to build a GI before we fully understandhow our brains work just like we we
 understood how to build flying machines long before we were able to build a

Speaker 2 :mechanical work bird yes are you going
 names you're given that the example exactly of mechanical birds andairplanes
 yeah my plans do a pretty good job of flying without really mimicking bird

Speaker 1 :flight and even now after 100 is 100
 years later did you see the TED talk with a mr. mechanical bird you mentionedit's amazing but even after that right
 we still don't fly in mechanical birds because it turned out the way we came up

Speaker 0 :with but simpler and it's better for our


Speaker 1 :purposes and I think it might be the
 same there that's one lesson and another

Speaker 0 :lesson it is one what did when our paper
 was about

Speaker 1 :well first we wife is a physicist
 thought it was fascinating how there is a very closed mathematical relationshipactually between our artificial neural
 networks and a lot of things that we've

Speaker 0 :studied for in physics go by nerdy names


Speaker 1 :like the renormalization group equation
 and napoleons and yada yada yada and

Speaker 0 :when you look a little more closely at
 this you have you at first there was a

Speaker 1 :well there's something crazy here that


Speaker 0 :doesn't make sense because we know that


Speaker 1 :if you even want to build a super simple
 neural network with hell that part cat

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :pictures and dog pictures right that you


Speaker 0 :can do that very very well now but if


Speaker 1 :you think about it a little bit you
 convince yourself it must be impossible

Speaker 0 :because if I have one megapixel even if


Speaker 1 :each pixel is just black or white
 there's 2 to the power 1 million possible images which is way more thanthere are atoms in our universe right so


Speaker 0 :in order to and then for each one of


Speaker 1 :those I have to assign a number which is
 the probability that it's a dog right so

Speaker 0 :an arbitrary function of images is a
 list of more numbers than there are

Speaker 1 :atoms in our universe so clearly I can't
 store that under the hood of my my GPU or maybe my computer yet somehow works

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :so what does that mean well it means
 that the out of all of the problems that

Speaker 0 :you could all try to solve with a neural
 network almost all of them are impossible to

Speaker 1 :solve with a reasonably sized one but


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :then what we should show it in our paper


Speaker 0 :was was that they the fraks the kind of
 problems the fraction of all the problems that you could possibly

Speaker 1 :pose that there that we actually care
 about given the laws of physics is also

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :an infinitesimally tiny little part and
 amazingly they're basically the same part yeah it's almost such that our

Speaker 2 :world was created for I mean they kind


Speaker 1 :of come together yeah but you could say
 maybe where the world created the world that the world was created for us but Ihave a more modest interpretation which
 is that instead evolution in downest but

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :neural networks precisely for that
 reason because this particular architecture as opposed to the one in

Speaker 0 :your laptop is very very well adapted


Speaker 1 :solving the kind of problems of nature
 kept presenting it our ancestors will read so it makes sense that why do wehave a brain in the first place it's to
 be able to make predictions about the future mm-hm and so on so if we had asucky system which could never solve it
 wouldn't have a logic so but it's so

Speaker 0 :this is this is a I think you're very
 beautiful fact yeah we also we also

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :realize that there's there that we


Speaker 1 :they've been it's been earlier work on


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :on why deeper networks are good but we
 were able to show an additional cool

Speaker 0 :fact there which is that them even


Speaker 1 :incredibly simple problems like suppose
 I gave you it I found the numbers and asked you to multiply them together inre you can write it's the few lines of
 code boom done trivial if you just try to do that with a neural network that

Speaker 0 :has only one single hidden layer in it
 you can do it but you're gonna need two

Speaker 1 :to the power a thousand neurons and to
 multiply a thousand numbers which is again more neurons than their atoms inour universe okay that's nothing but if


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you're allowed if you love yourself


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :make it a deep network with many layers
 you only need four thousand neurons it's

Speaker 0 :perfectly feasible so that's really


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :interesting there yeah yeah so on
 another architecture type I mean you mentioned Schrodinger's equation andwhat what are your thoughts about
 quantum computing and the role of this kind of computational unit in creatingan intelligent system in some Hollywood


Speaker 0 :movies that are a lot mentioned my name


Speaker 1 :you don't want to spoil them
 the the NAD is building a quantum computerlist yes because the word quantum sounds


Speaker 0 :cool and so it's right mines first of
 all I think we don't need quantum

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :computers they build a GI I suspect your
 brain is not quantum computer and then

Speaker 1 :they found sense so you don't even wrote
 a paper about that what many years ago would excite Chocula the decoherenceso-called B coherence time that how long
 it takes until the quantum computer nosov what your neurons are doing gets

Speaker 0 :erased mm-hmm why just random noise from


Speaker 1 :the environment and then it's about 10
 to the minus 21 seconds so as cool as it

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :would be to have a quantum computer in
 my head I don't think that fast

Speaker 0 :yeah on the other hand there are very
 cool things you could do with quantum

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :computers though I think we'll be able
 to do soon when we get big what bigger ones that might actually help machine

Speaker 1 :learning do even better than the brain


Speaker 0 :mm-hmm though for example one this is
 moonshot but hey you know learning is very much same thing is search mm-hmm if

Speaker 1 :you have if you try to train a neural


Speaker 0 :network to get really learn to do
 something really well you'd have some

Speaker 1 :lost function you have some you have a


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :bunch of knobs you can turn represented
 by a bunch of numbers and you're trying

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :to tweak them so that it become as good
 as possible at this thing so if you

Speaker 0 :think of a landscape with some Valley
 where each dimension of the landscape

Speaker 1 :corresponds to some number you can
 change you're trying to find the minimum

Speaker 0 :and it's well-known that if you have a


Speaker 1 :very high dimensional landscape
 complicated things super hard to find

Speaker 0 :the minimum later quantum mechanics is


Speaker 1 :amazingly good at this right if I want
 to know what's the lowest energy state

Speaker 0 :this water can possibly have incredibly


Speaker 1 :hard to compute but we can but nature
 will happily figure this out for you if you just cool it down and make you very

Speaker 0 :very cold if you put a ball somewhere


Speaker 1 :it'll roll down to its minimum and this
 happens metaphorically

Speaker 0 :and the energy landscape too and quantum


Speaker 1 :mechanics even used as a mode some
 clever tricks which today is machine learning systems don't like if you'retrying to find the minimum and you get
 stuck in a little local minima here in quantum mechanics you can actuallytunnel through the barrier and get


Speaker 0 :unstuck in Yemen and that's really


Speaker 1 :interesting yeah so it may be for
 example it will one day use quantum

Speaker 0 :computers that help train neural


Speaker 1 :networks better that's really


Speaker 2 :interesting okay so as a component of
 kind of the learning process for example yeah

Speaker 0 :let me ask sort of wrapping up here a


Speaker 2 :little bit let me let me return to the
 questions of our human nature and and love as I mentioned so do you think you

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 2 :mentioned sort of a helper robot you can
 think of also personal robots do you think the way we human beings fall inlove and get connected to each other
 it's possible to achieve in an AI system and human-level AI intelligence systemdo you think we would ever see that kind
 of connection or you know in all this discussion about solving complex goalsyeah as this kind of human social
 connection do you think that's one of the goals and the peaks and valleys thatwith the raising sea levels that we'll
 be able to achieve or do you think that's something that's ultimately or atleast in the short term relative to
 other goals is not achievable I think

Speaker 1 :it's all possible and I mean in in


Speaker 0 :recent there's that there's a very wide


Speaker 1 :range of guesses as you know among AI
 researchers when we're gonna get a GI

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :some people you know like your friend
 Rodney Brooks says it's gonna be hundred hundreds of years least and then thereare many others I think it's gonna
 happen relative much sooner and recent

Speaker 0 :polls and be half or so or AI


Speaker 1 :researchers think it's we're gonna get


Speaker 0 :AGI within decades so if that happens of


Speaker 1 :course then I think these things are all
 possible but in terms of whether it will

Speaker 0 :happen I don't I think we shouldn't


Speaker 1 :spend so much time asking what do we
 think will happen in the future as if we are just some sort of pathetic yourpassive bystanders you know waiting for
 the future

Speaker 0 :happen to us hey we're the ones creating
 this future right so we should be proactive about it and ask us of what

Speaker 1 :sort of future we would like to have
 happen that's right trying to make it like that well what I

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :prefer it to some sort of incredibly
 boring zombie like future where there's all these mechanical things happen it isno fashion no emotion no experience


Speaker 0 :maybe even no I would of course much


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :rather prefer it if all the things that


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :we find that we value the most about
 humanity our subjective experience

Speaker 1 :passion inspiration you love you know if


Speaker 0 :we can create a future where those are


Speaker 1 :those things do exist no I think


Speaker 0 :ultimately it's not our universe giving


Speaker 1 :meaning to us just us giving me the


Speaker 0 :universe and if we build more advanced


Speaker 1 :intelligence let's let's make sure we're


Speaker 0 :building in such a way that meaning
 these but it's part of it I want a lot

Speaker 2 :of people that seriously study this
 problem and think of it from different angles have trouble and the majority ofcases if they think through that happen
 you know are the ones that are not beneficial to humanity right and so yeahso what what are your thoughts was an


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :engine what's what should people you
 know I really don't like people to be terrifiedyou should what's a way for people to
 think about it in a way that instead you know we can solve it okay to make it

Speaker 1 :better yeah no I don't think panicking


Speaker 0 :is gonna help in any way it's not


Speaker 1 :increase chances of things going well
 either even if you are in a situation where there is a real threatdoes it help if everybody just freaks
 out right no of course of course not I

Speaker 0 :think yeah there are of course ways in


Speaker 1 :which things can go horribly wrong first


Speaker 0 :of all it's important when we think


Speaker 1 :about this thing this about the problems
 and risks that also remember how huge the upsides can be if we get it right Ihad everything everything we love about
 society and civilization of the product of intelligence so if we can amplify ourintelligence or machine intelligence and
 not anymore lose our loved one to what we're told as an uncurable disease andthings like this of


Speaker 0 :we should aspire to that so that can be


Speaker 1 :a motivator I think reminding ourselves
 that the reason we try to solve problems

Speaker 0 :is not just because we're trying to


Speaker 1 :avoid gloom but because we're trying to
 do something great but then in terms of

Speaker 0 :the risks I think um the entry the


Speaker 1 :important question is to ask what can we
 do today they will actually help yes how

Speaker 0 :come good may in it and dismissing the


Speaker 1 :risk is not one of them you know it I


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :find it quite funny often when I'm in on
 discussion panels about these things how

Speaker 0 :the people who work for come for


Speaker 1 :companies lobbies they're always like oh
 nothing to worry about nothing to worry about nothing to worry aboutand the it's always all it's only
 academics sometimes it's expressed concerns that's not surprising at all if

Speaker 0 :you think about it Upton Sinclair
 quipped right that it's hard to make

Speaker 1 :your man believe in something when you
 think some the fans are not believing in

Speaker 0 :it and and frankly we know a lot of


Speaker 1 :these people in companies and that
 they're just as concerned as anyone else but if you're the CEO of a companythat's not something you want to go on
 record saying when you have silly journalists so we're gonna put a pictureof a Terminator robot when they quote


Speaker 0 :you so so the issues are real and the


Speaker 1 :way I am the way I think about what the


Speaker 0 :issue is it is basically you know but
 the real choice we have is first of all

Speaker 1 :are we gonna stir this dismiss this the
 risks and say well you know let's just

Speaker 0 :go ahead and build machines that can do


Speaker 1 :everything we can do better and cheaper
 you know let's just make yourselves obsolete as fast as possible or whatcould possibly go wrong right that's one


Speaker 0 :attitude the opposite attitude that I


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :think is to say is incredible potential
 you know let's think about what kind of future we're really really excited about

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :what are the shared goals that we can


Speaker 1 :really aspire towards and then let's
 think really hard on how about how we can actually get there as it's a start

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :with it no don't start thinking about
 the risk start thinking about the goals

Speaker 0 :goals yeah and then when you do that


Speaker 1 :then you can think about the obstacles
 you want to avoid well they often get students coming in right here into myoffice for career advising always ask
 them this very question where you want to be in the future man if all shecan say is oh maybe I'll have cancer
 maybe I'll run over by a tortoise and

Speaker 2 :obstacles instead of the bill he's just


Speaker 1 :gonna end up a hypochondriac paranoid
 yeah whereas if she comes in and fire in her eyes and it's like I want to bethere and then we can talk about the
 obstacles and see how we can circumvent them that's I think a much much

Speaker 0 :healthier attitude and um that's really


Speaker 1 :well plan and I I feel it's it's very


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :challenging to come up with a vision for


Speaker 0 :the future which we wish we are


Speaker 1 :unequivocally excited about I'm not just
 talking now in the vague terms like yeah let's cure cancer fine I'm talking aboutwhat kind of society do we want to
 create what do we want it to mean you

Speaker 0 :know to be human in the Age of AI in the


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :age of AGI so if we can have this


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :conversation broad inclusive


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :conversation and gradually start
 converging towards some some future that

Speaker 1 :with some direction at least that we
 want to steer towards right then then no

Speaker 0 :we'll be much more motivated to


Speaker 1 :constructively take on the obstacles and


Speaker 0 :I think if I had if I had the I think if


Speaker 1 :you make if I try to wrap this up in a


Speaker 0 :more sixteenth way I think I think we
 can all agree already now that we should aspire to build AGI but doesn't

Speaker 1 :overpower us but that empowers us and


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 2 :think of the many various ways that can
 do that whether that's from my side of the world of autonomous vehicles I I'mpersonally actually from the camp that
 believes there's human level intelligence is required to to achievesomething like vehicles that would
 actually be something we would enjoy using and being part of so that's oneexample and certainly there's a lot of
 other types of robots in medicine and so on so focusing on those and then andthen coming up with the obstacles coming
 up with the ways that that can go wrong and solving those one at a time and just

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :because you can build an autonomous


Speaker 0 :vehicle even if you could build one that


Speaker 1 :would drive this finalize you know maybe


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :there are some things in life that we
 would actually want to do ourselves that's right my

Speaker 0 :like for example if you think of our


Speaker 1 :society as a whole there's something


Speaker 0 :that we find very meaningful to do and
 that doesn't mean we have to stop doing

Speaker 1 :them just because machines can do them
 better you know I'm not gonna stop playing tennis just the base of my builda tennis robot yeah beat me people are


Speaker 2 :still playing chess and even go yeah and


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :I in this in the very near term even


Speaker 1 :some people are advocating basic income


Speaker 0 :replace jobs but if you if the


Speaker 1 :government is gonna be willing to just


Speaker 0 :hand out cash to people for doing
 nothing then one should also seriously

Speaker 1 :consider whether the government should
 also just hire a lot more teachers and

Speaker 0 :nurses and the kind of jobs which people
 often find great fulfillment in doing

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :right I get very tired of hearing
 politicians saying oh we can't afford hiring more teachers but we're going to

Speaker 1 :maybe have basic income if we can have
 more serious research and thought into what gives meaning to our lives and thejobs give so much more than income right


Speaker 0 :mm-hm and then think about in the future
 well what are the role of the yeah what are the roles that we want to havepeople feeling empowered by machines and


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :I think sort of I come from the Russia
 from the Soviet Union and I think for a lot of people in the 20th century goingto the moon going to space was an
 inspiring thing I feel like the the the universe of the mind so AI understandingcreating intelligence is that for the
 21st century so it's really surprising and I've heard you mention this it'sreally surprising to me both on the
 research funding side that it's not funded as greatly as it could be butmost importantly on the politicians side
 that it's not part of the public discourse except in the kilobotsTerminator kind of view that people are
 not yet I think perhaps excited by the possible positive future that we canbuild together certainly should be


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :because politicians usually just focus


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :on the next election cycle right the


Speaker 1 :single most important thing I feel we
 humans have learned and the entire

Speaker 0 :history of science is there were the


Speaker 1 :Masters of underestimation we
 underestimated

Speaker 0 :the science of our cosmos


Speaker 1 :again and again realizing of everything
 we thought existed was just a small part of something grander right planet solar

Speaker 0 :system the galaxy clusters of guises
 universe so and we now know that we but the future has just so much morepotential than our ancestors could ever
 have dreamt of this cosmos well imagine if all of Earth was completely devoid oflife except for Cambridge Massachusetts


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :that would wouldn't it be kind of lame
 if all we ever aspired to it to stay in

Speaker 1 :Cambridge Massachusetts forever and then


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :go extinct in one week
 even though Earth was gonna continue on for longer that that sort of attitude I

Speaker 0 :think we have now on the cosmic scale we
 can fluid life can flourish on earth not

Speaker 1 :foreign for four years but for billions
 of years yes I can even tell you about how to move it out of harm's way when

Speaker 0 :its own Sun gets too hot and and then we


Speaker 1 :have so much more resources out here


Speaker 0 :which today yeah maybe there are a lot
 of other planets with bacteria or a cow like life on them but I most of this allthis opportunity seems as far as we can


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :fail to be largely dead like the Sahara
 Desert and yet we have the opportunity but to helplife flourish promise there are billions


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :of year and so like let's quit
 squabbling about when some little border

Speaker 1 :should be drawn one-fifth one mile to
 the left to right and realize hey you

Speaker 0 :know we can do such incredible things


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 2 :yeah and that's I think why it's really
 exciting that yeah you and others are connected with some of the working lamosque is doing because he's literally
 going out into that space we're exploring our universe and it's

Speaker 1 :wonderful that is exactly why Elon Musk


Speaker 0 :is so it misunderstood right misconstrue


Speaker 1 :him is some kind of pessimistic dooms
 there the reason he cares so much about the I safety is because he more than

Speaker 0 :almost anyone else appreciates these


Speaker 1 :amazing opportunities they will squander
 if we wipe out out here on earth and we're not just gonna wipe out the

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :next generation but all generations and


Speaker 0 :this incredible opportunity that's out


Speaker 1 :there that would be really a waste and


Speaker 0 :AI for people who think that we better


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :to do without technology well let me
 just mention that if we don't improve

Speaker 1 :our technology the question isn't
 whether humanity is gonna go extinct question is just whether we're gonna gettaken out by the next big asteroid or
 the next supervolcano or something else dumb that we could easily prevent with

Speaker 0 :more tech right and if we want life to


Speaker 1 :flourish throughout the cosmos AI is the


Speaker 0 :key to it as I mentioned a lot of detail


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :in my book right there even many of the
 most inspired sci-fi writers I feel have

Speaker 1 :totally underestimated the opportunities


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :for space travel especially to other
 galaxies because they weren't thinking about the possibility of AGI which just

Speaker 0 :makes it so much easier right yeah so


Speaker 2 :that goes to your view of AGI that
 enables our progress that enables a better life so that's a beautiful that'sa beautiful way to put it and then
 something to strive for so max thank you so much thank you for your time todayit's been awesome thank you so much


Speaker 1 :
