Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Alexander Friedmann he's a professor at Drexel University and the director ofthe nihai and plasma Institute he's one
 of the top plasma physicists and plasma chemists in the world and mostimportantly to me he's my dad
 plasma by the way is not referring to blood plasma in biology but to thefourth state of matter in physics solid
 liquid gas and plasma which is a gas of charged particles that behaves infascinating ways plasma makes up the Sun
 the Stars lightning plasma displays fluorescent lamps and is the most commonstate of matter in the universe this is
 the 100th episode of this podcast there were quite a few very big conversationswhich were all options but I decided to
 go back to where it all started for me and to do a personal conversation withmy dad this was a difficult conversation
 for me for many reasons but life is shortperhaps we needed microphones to give us
 a chance to say the things we never would have said otherwise this is thatconversation this is also a chance to
 briefly look back if you don't know I stepped down from my full-time positionat MIT to pursue a dream of building a
 start-up around AI systems that form meaningful connections with human beingsI didn't have much money the videos I've
 made and this podcast was a way to try to pay for food and rent while taking onthe startup journey it also gave me a
 chance to have conversations with people who inspire me who make me think and toshare it with an amazing community
 frankly I don't know what to do with the idea that this thing has been listenedto thirty five million times I'm pretty
 sure most of those are AI BOTS but if you're one of the rare biologicalsystems listening to this thank you I
 feel the love it gives me a lot of strength in both this and the startup bythe way
 some people asked my full very Russian birth name is Alexei Alexei or Alyoshaor as my mom might say
 Yoshioka but I've always enjoyed all my friends and people close to me we'llcall me Lex or Lex in English a few
 folks and companies donated money and sponsored this podcast and they're thereasons I'm here the best way you can

 I've been in a mix as you might know of keto and carnivore diet for a very longtime now that means eating very little
 carbs I used to love cereal obviously most cereals have crazy amounts of sugarwhich is terrible for you so I quit
 years ago but magic spoon is a totally new thing zero sugar 11 grams of proteinand only three net grams of carbs it
 tastes delicious and honestly way too good to be true Iuse it to celebrate a good training

 regret it and now here's my conversation with mydad
 Alexander Friedmann what to you is the most beautiful idea in physics chemistryor mathematics whoo let's go to that
 place first before we go to the to Kiev

Speaker 0 :of the most beautiful in physics
 chemistry I would say I would say Einstein his ideas regarding stochasticmotion and Brownian motion I think it is
 the most beautiful clear simple idea because from these like statistics youcan prove existence of molecules believe
 me or not it was I think it was his first publication in 1905 with his firstwife it was significantly her idea


Speaker 1 :that's right there were collaborators
 yes those five four four five papers he

Speaker 0 :published yeah I actually almost
 everything which Einstein did it was published the most important stuff theywere published in one here one nine on
 five but the first idea was probably the most elegant cases charge Brownian

Speaker 1 :motion and why you think it's beautiful


Speaker 0 :if you see that people at that time they
 understand that if molecules if they exist their motion is absolutely chaoticboom-boom boom-boom-boom
 what he proved the dust matter what size of particles is there motionless similarabout the same so it is not necessary to
 see molecules you can look at bigger particles like if you smoke there isparticles and you can see like a
 propagation of this smoke and from here determine behavior of molecules andthat's actually relatively short very
 elegant very clear and at that point people they kept talking about moleculesbut it was no proof because there is no
 like a super electronic microscope to see them so you know I'm saying yesmolecules they exist you said well I
 mean can you show me there so my Stein made it and booked and heproved that a lot of people after these
 public hearings that hmm probably molecules really exists Einstein in 1905

Speaker 1 :so what do you like about that idea the
 isn't olicity simplicity that's what it

Speaker 0 :is we proving something very very very
 very very very complicated so if I ask you for example you know molecules likethis can you prove it obviously like now
 you would say ok I have a special electronic microscope and I can we'lltake a look that small ok but when you
 go back to beginning of 20th century people they were laughing can you provesons you know you can no no no no take a
 look it's something very simple very very simple very very simple what do you

Speaker 1 :think it takes to do that kind of
 thinking and come to those ideas and how many times have you encountered those

Speaker 0 :kinds of ideas in your life have you had


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :any yeah yeah I would say that's
 that's the whole beauty my feeling that's the whole beauty of science it'sjust you know people they say no no no
 no it's so - it's impossible or and you say no no wait take a look take a lookwait a second did they take a look just
 think for five minutes if something is very complicated you know kapitza NobelPrize all right like I work with him by
 the way he used to say if it is complicated it's probably wrongah well it was a lot of discussion
 didn't kapitza inland ow because Landau he he enjoyed to do something in a mostcomplicated way why his friend Kapisa he
 was trying to do everything is an absolutely simple way and they had allthese discussions because sometimes
 capital he went to extremes and he used to say well this is simple it means thisis right now he was like okay you means
 that everything we simple is right i

Speaker 1 :mean like Fineman - yeah you like the


Speaker 0 :simple yes yes yes yes that's the whole
 point to find this simplicity that's that's the beauty of science that's abeauty really there's a beautiful that's
 something worse to do like at the risk

Speaker 1 :of going religious for a second
 why do you think our universe allows for such simplicity to be discovered that

Speaker 0 :such simplicity exists at all I can I
 can tell you it is very similar to Darwin's theory why I don't know whyanimals they're this way not the other
 way so it is actually competition take a look about simplicity in beauty ofphysics like you have two interacting
 planets and the force is proportional to one over R squared in this case they areable to go in circles or
 ellipses if there is another law they are either falling or we're out so likeso if like our solar system exists so
 just the interactions would be at 1 over R squared that's it it's veryinteresting about Isaac Newton and his
 way of thinking that's also was the super I would say genius is it weird to

Speaker 1 :you talking about noon that action a


Speaker 0 :distance for example this stuff I was
 doing in elementary school which is funny which without any knowledge ofphysics but I I was doing physics
 because of fighting throwing things how

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :better than that better than that we
 played well it was 3rd 2nd 3rd gray so it's in 1962 1963 so from one hand youknow key if that time so people they
 were excited about worse obviously always especially boys and also you knowwe were way better than Americans
 because you know we have first picnic yeahand Gagarin I remember how happy we were


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :when was good Irene a year yo I'm afraid
 to make a mistake but I think it's 1961 or 1962 in 1961 1962 because what Iremember that I was in there either in
 first grade or a second grade and it was no bread delivery or not at that timewas a big problem because of Khrushchev
 and the carriage of shortage of bread

Speaker 1 :shortage of all kinds of food no


Speaker 0 :potatoes no it was a mistake actually of
 crucial because when he came to America he saw that corners everywhere and hedecided yeah that if he put enough corn
 in Russia Russia will be way stronger from thepoint of Agriculture than America
 and but he overdid it as a result it was a shortage of wheat hmm so that's why Iremember this moment


Speaker 1 :so just for kids lastly you remember so
 yes so for kids what it is no no no no

Speaker 0 :each day yeah during the class you know
 the special guy used to come and give a small piece of white bread to each kidwhite bread
 yeah white bread and at the same time hmm like a teacher and I always forgotabout this
 Gagarin went to the space and kids they

Speaker 1 :even forgot about this the bread so
 that's how big of a moment it is then

Speaker 0 :you're near I got bad take a look if you
 are a boy you think about leasing out space so like a 1/2 of voice they wantto be astronauts cosmonauts who we used
 to say and the other half wanted to design rockets so I was from this secondpart so myself with friends we start
 designing small rockets to fight second grade second grade a second third secondthird grade and we have been fighting
 with these guys from a next-door house because these idiots they used to useonly stones against us well and it was a
 big fence between houses so jazz they throw stones and we decided to makerockets well and we made it and a


Speaker 1 :scientist was born engineer - yes it was


Speaker 0 :both science and engineering well let me


Speaker 1 :ask was at that moment or in general
 when did you first fall in love with

Speaker 0 :science I would say science I think
 clearly this fight with these beds the rawest there are the kids with whichkeep throwing stones from another side
 of the fence and we start making rockets what has he been a rocket as a fuel weuse a mixture of photographic films with
 special chemicals yeah we consulted with the boys from high school about somedetails and we'd made it more or less
 and then it was that stuff was actually wrapped into the silver foil and in theend we put like a match so with another
 match we light it and this stuff was going like sometimes ten meters yeah andit was able to go to like 2 meters high
 but very often it was mistakes because like we were bad with stability so whatI try to calculate at this moment is


Speaker 1 :elect a trajectory hmm stability meaning
 while it's in the air yeah control

Speaker 0 :problem yes yes control Sheikh so I try


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :to try to calculate what motion to


Speaker 1 :describe the moment where to point it


Speaker 0 :so where to point it to be sure that it
 will go far enough and it will go above the defense whichwas maybe one meter eighty or something
 like that so so what was most

Speaker 1 :interesting to you the calculations of
 the math physics of calculating the trajectory or the fact that you couldengineer build something that's based on


Speaker 0 :science in in the beginning in the
 beginning in the beginning to be honest I was happy to fight these idiots and Ihave title defense yeah which what's
 funny that we used to do that and and they kept throwing stones which actuallyyou cannot prove anything but then in
 the end of this period actually I fall in love please

Speaker 1 :science what is science to you so there
 in the inner period your eight-year-old

Speaker 0 :here one of teen events so not just to
 throw a stone but just to make something and just and take a look we made it so

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the the the creation yeah and also
 another important stuff when you are doing this kind of stuff so your friendsthey start thinking that you are not so


Speaker 1 :bad you know also it's a way to earn
 respect credit on their on the playground yeah

Speaker 0 :yeah we were not interested in girls you
 know when you are like a second third grade we just do we hated girls yeah butit was very important to have respect
 from yeah from well always follow along right yeah yeah yeah yeah it's acamaraderie and just feeling and secret


Speaker 1 :from parents and just to linger in it
 because you brought it up Gagarin yeah what are your thoughtsyou know it's inspired on the American
 side the Apollo missions inspired an entire generation of scientists what wasyour thought about Gagarin and the space
 race and how that made you feel what were role did it play in your life to be

Speaker 0 :honest the whole country had a huge
 respect to Gagarin he was a nice person very simple and he was hero because youknow to be first to go to the space yeah
 knowing the percentage of success at the time with dogs was way far from 100%it's a big deal I would not say that it
 inspired like a science science no it did notbut making rockets it was just
 interesting and about America we are way better than America that's the way wehave been thinking I mean come on is


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :that yeah that's it was even not a


Speaker 1 :question yeah in America was saying the
 same it's propaganda I was its

Speaker 0 :propaganda but keep in mind very very
 important actually at that time in these years Russia was way ahead yeah there is

Speaker 1 :it was no NASA that's right that's so
 the fact that Russia is way ahead is what motivated America to really step it

Speaker 0 :up it's from one hint but from another
 hand for Russian kids of a second grader and third grade mmm-hmm come on we didnot think about America that's like you
 know

Speaker 1 :yeah that's millions miles away yeah
 besides physics you also have poetry in your blood sowhat has been your relationship to
 poetry music what role did you play in

Speaker 0 :your life poetry a lot but it is way
 later then then Elementary School actually like music wise you know likeOh teenagers they're in love with music
 and it's just exactly the same now and twenty years ago and thirty years ago Iwould say at that time at that time we
 were all in love with one special group which is Beatles and II and what wasextremely positive later its I was in
 sixth grade fifth grade of the 60 64 65 66 and in Soviet Union Beatles they wereforbidden deliver not it was absolutely
 strange but at the same time if something is forbidden that's exactlywhat you love most
 so I remember that for my big successes in science I was awarded who is going tothis best of the best
 camps pioneer camps Arctic in Crimea and over there it was international so I metwith I live together with group of
 people from friends yeah because I was the only one kind of speaking fluentlyin French and we just made trade so we
 gave whatever we used to have and we got Beatles records little records and we go

Speaker 1 :yes that's the rebellion you're part of
 it what about poetry what when did you firstI mean you've written a lot of what poet


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :what maybe do you remember an early poem


Speaker 0 :you've written a bad one no I started
 doing that late so it was I was in

Speaker 1 :seventh grade I think that's late Oh


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :writing poetry I thought and writing
 poetry is a little bit related to when boys they start looking at girls it wasa little bit different eyes we just


Speaker 1 :loved it somehow behind even not so much


Speaker 0 :even laughs even just you know this
 imagination right like way far from reality it's a it is romanticism were

Speaker 1 :you a serious poet or or funny poem
 because you have a lot of humor example

Speaker 0 :it's later yeah but at that time as was
 extremely serious Mir extremely romantic which never everbefore after that is hardly management


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :yeah but it is kind of a little bit like
 a childish romanticism or childish I mean you know that bad but it was it'sinteresting enough that first poetry was
 actually almost immediately from my purview very good it not like you knowyou're doing something not good and then
 better and and better and then better mmm it's actually totally opposite beststuff which I wrote it was like a south
 great well around more like eight and nice great and I wrote a lot at that

Speaker 1 :time why do you think you were so what
 does it mean what good is good poetry mean that means it's not cheesy it'sbeautifully worded and he crafted it yes
 and so ha where did that come from was most people even great poets areterrible at first so why why were you so
 clever quickly as most people know you as really fine clever no I mean wouldwords write very young words so you're
 saying that was early on you already had

Speaker 0 :that yes I have no good answer it comes
 from nowhere yeah from but Michael Rockets just don't

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :know it woody poet wasn't recognized it


Speaker 0 :was it was actually to be honest no not
 so much connection but in Russian culture romanticism it is extremelyimportant element you know starting from
 19th century Romanticism so yes it was very popular so either you are writinggood poetry or bad poetry or you are an
 artist you are like a you know painting something so I have a lot of friends

Speaker 1 :they do painting do you remember poetry
 do you remember a poem from that time

Speaker 0 :you've written by any chance yeah sure
 I remember most of them by heart you

Speaker 1 :mind you mind reciting their in Russian


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :Russian is good as long as they're not


Speaker 0 :in French I have in French oh you wanna


Speaker 1 :me just do what do you think what what's


Speaker 0 :comfortable you know maybe I will read
 one poor one point which I like most from that period and I'm not sure that Iwrote something better after that well
 it's a little bit cheesy however but not much yeah it's like it's even not aboutgirls it's about music hmm but still


Speaker 1 :remain a romanticized kind of wisdoms


Speaker 0 :very strong medicine act was the result
 of me reading a book particular janeyah catimorhistoria de chine another kappelmeister
 organic wrestler actually the story of a cat who foundthe book or like a notebook but the
 notebook of people he starts reading about that and analyzing their life sothe life of people through eyes of a
 very very smart cat so then I can read it in Russian right and in the spoilerif you want please I'll be doing ok

Speaker 0 :would say that whatever I did later it


Speaker 1 :was however you do here so someone's
 great so this eight eight great it's very 15 that is that's very good yeah

Speaker 0 :and it's a that's a romanticism you know
 I was a little bit of like it too much it's musically cheesiness a little bit Iwould say but very strong


Speaker 1 :so let's go let's go okay to Kiev okay


Speaker 0 :let's go to Kiev you were born and


Speaker 1 :raised in Kiev just like yes the guys
 with the rocks and the Rockets but that

Speaker 0 :was the


Speaker 1 :guys you know I get word he got that you


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :can hold a grudge
 what are some memories of your dad and mom that stand out and hmm okay yeah

Speaker 0 :what we do well let's drink in Japanese


Speaker 1 :so yeah what are we drinking Japanese


Speaker 0 :whiskey in Japanese whiskey they call it


Speaker 1 :from the barrel or not sponsored by NECA


Speaker 0 :whiskey but in the whiskey yeah we do
 not but they're doing a very very good jobyeah and they are in Sapporo it's
 Hokkaido north of Japan so they are doing good beer which is superbthey good very good whiskey and a lot of
 red caviar and make sure that's it

Speaker 1 :did you ever think when you were that
 shortage of bread and you're doing the rocket that you'll be sitting here inAmerica few years later drinking


Speaker 0 :Japanese whiskey talking about caviar


Speaker 1 :did you even know what caviar was oh no


Speaker 0 :no obviously because scaler it was for
 holidays a little bit and it was distributed it's not like you're goingbuy it but you got it a little bit like
 a small can so we all of us we knew that and just itwas very popular and well let me just


Speaker 1 :actually ask that question how did you
 imagine what where you would be 50 years from then I think how did you think

Speaker 0 :about your future actually like in about
 eight grades nine grades I was very very very very very very good in physicsmathematics and chemistry so I was
 actually in this system of like an Olympiad so-called competitionI was absolutely number one in Ukraine
 twice and absolute number two in Soviet

Speaker 1 :Union also twice this is physics
 competition or mathematics okay it was physics so therefore people who don'tknow maybe you can explain I mean this
 is still goes on to this day these are very intense competitions I don't knowif they're that popular in the United
 States probably because the United States folks don't do is great but I

Speaker 0 :there it is extremely popular but not in
 physics what is going on in this country I was very much impressed it's a veryserious and very tough competition in
 mathematics in math that's right in physics class and biology last so you

Speaker 1 :already know new somewhat in eighth
 grade that you're very good and yes wait a minute you said chemistry - yes ofchemistry - physics chemistry and
 competed you won in Ukraine and I was

Speaker 0 :number two in Soviet Union it was twice
 now very interesting that in Soviet unit was a rule you supposed to choose so youcan participate in this competition in
 physics mathematics and chemistry and all three of them up to the level ofchampionship of the region of the big
 city in my cases was Kiev but then to go to competition in Ukraine you have tochoose you can go to only to one so I
 want physics and chemistry and mathematics in Kiev then I choosephysics and I was going to Ukrainian now
 if you win in Ukraine so a couple of people from the whole Ukraine goes tothis championship of Soviet Union that's


Speaker 1 :an incredible accomplishment whether
 using it was I mean you basically you peaked in terms of physics and poetry at

Speaker 0 :age 14 that's a big difference you know
 in physics I was really on top of the Soviet Union which is a huge country inpoetry it was just but no I'm not a
 professional you know and you can't

Speaker 1 :compete in poetry way


Speaker 0 :yeah well by the way over there gold
 medal from high school so what you call here a valedictorian which is hard to do

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :I would say here it's also very the
 announcing independent school but in Kiev it was an interesting situationbecause oh you have to the most
 difficult was actually not physics mathematics and it was writing butbecause it was writing not on the
 computer without spellcheck it just and you have to write hard to when you letme see let me hear no 12 12 pages as
 minimum of an essay and it's supposed to be zero mistakesand the Russian language is not the
 easiest one and when you say mistakes I

Speaker 1 :mean this is what makes the grammar real
 wrong mistake it's not just its grammar it's writing mistakes - oh no I wouldn't

Speaker 0 :mean writing mistake I just incorrect
 use of word or something can you cross

Speaker 1 :stuff out no right this is the you can't
 make a mistake in the actual writing process you're writing with a pen

Speaker 0 :yeah and immersive you're not supposed
 to make any direction and you're not

Speaker 1 :allowed to cross the lines and that's
 its perfection in song and all the

Speaker 0 :victory is for me and it's silly but me


Speaker 1 :what do you think about that is it what
 what do you think about that strictness

Speaker 0 :because it it it's easy to criticize


Speaker 1 :from a distance but there's something
 powerful about it yes there is it you

Speaker 0 :know what counter is more powerful from
 this point of view is Japan is pest retinasI was so much impressed with their kids
 what they keep saying that in Japan for kidsit does matter it's a holiday or the
 weekend or whatever each day you supposed to train with these Japanesecharacters because it's not it's just
 impossible just to remember it so they are there working too hard but as aresult they can say for them koala t
 because quality means no mistakes alright that's very interesting pointwhat does mean quality it means no miss
 isn't perfectionism perfectionism creates this kind of

Speaker 1 :whiskey yeah which this is what perfect
 tastes like it's interesting I mean it forces you to take this educationseriously everything seriously like this
 yeah this craftsmanship it did cross me

Speaker 0 :seriously yes yes yes and you know I I
 mentioned to you this exam this exam in in Russian I say but it was somethingwhich was worse than that
 yeah because because it was Kiev we supposed to take two essays one inRussian language and also in Ukrainian
 language so think for a second it's a it's not your native language and he'ssupposed to also write this at least 12
 pages without with zero mistakes and without any possibility to make any itshould be perfect as a result was funny
 that I speak Ukrainian not bad at all because of this I wouldn't say that's agood idea but it's it's kind of Russian
 Russian version of of a Japanese story

Speaker 1 :but yeah you know there's a lot of
 interesting other strict things I get to memorize poetry here to memorize thingswhich I mean that's a really interesting


Speaker 0 :exercise oh that's what probably you


Speaker 1 :remember yeah though it still was there


Speaker 0 :when I was there yeah yeah like I used
 to know at least thousand poems by heart

Speaker 1 :by heart and you still remember many of


Speaker 0 :your own by heart yeah it's by the way
 helps this mathematics how good memory

Speaker 1 :just memory okay so you said you already
 knew I mean it's an incredible incredible accomplishment to be at thatlevel in physics at that young age so
 what did you think about the future returning to the original question wheredo you think that would take you this
 fascination and this skill with physics did you imagine hiding a professor didyou imagine being Hine Stein


Speaker 0 :you know kids in high school I mean at
 least between us and I was like already in in high school it was like specialhigh school in physics and mathematics
 we were all like not only dreaming but being sure we can do that we can be bestof the best in the world and and it was
 very popular subject at that time if you are like the best thing in physics it'sthe way more you are way more popular
 than a guy who is the best in basketball

Speaker 1 :yes interesting I mean that's why do you
 think that isn't a Soviet Union that it was so respected it's so admired whenyou were great at science it was


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :propaganda so was the state created


Speaker 0 :there yes so and it was good do you


Speaker 1 :think we'll ever see that in America
 without authoritarian in a democracy because in America Brad Pitt and MichaelJordan are the superstars and scientists
 most people don't know a single scientist except Einstein in America

Speaker 0 :well I would say my feeling it should
 happen in America it should happen to two boys and girls in America it should

Speaker 1 :be sure it meaning like that's a good
 thing or is everything anyway it is very

Speaker 0 :important because if if kids in America
 they are just not so much good in sciences sooner or later we will losecompetition to to countries where
 science is very much high prestige example today unfortunately not Russianthe best example today is probably chain
 I I've been there I saw their high schools we have to be very careful withthat so my feeling that that it should
 be done because in America university education is way stronger than in Russiaand they're way stronger than in Europe
 but high school education in America is not so so strong well yeah it's

Speaker 1 :difficult to understand why but why what
 do you think the universities are so strong in America why do you think themost Nobel prizes are from America why
 do you think science is so good even though scientists were never reallyworshipped in America because in Russia


Speaker 0 :it was always a problem so the strongest
 you know that people students kids they they're they are very hard workers whenthey are in high school because after
 that there is a very strong competition to get to a good university very veryvery challenging the same in China so
 you have to be very good to enter very good University so kids they work likecrazy to do that also boys they knew
 that they have take a look you have one chance in most of cases with exceptionof couple of universities have only one
 chance to go to one University to try yourselfif you make it you become a student if
 not you go to the army for three years so you it's very interesting it's a verypsychologically interesting situation
 because what is going on you have to make a decision by yourself are youstrong enough to go to the best place
 because it's only one place you can go now they start changing this system butin 1960 seventies eighties nineties it
 was the case so just another cost

Speaker 1 :because the feeling once you're choosing


Speaker 0 :you don't get in course not money-wise
 but real cost if you are a boy if you if you justoverestimate yourself mm-hmm is that


Speaker 1 :when you got that line in your hair that
 that period so for people who don't know my dad's hair now is white but he usedto have the sexy stripe down the middle


Speaker 0 :for many decades yeah yeah yeah 10 20 30


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :a lot of my pictures I have this right
 now anymore nothing he wants a good look

Speaker 1 :now
 so anyway is that when you got a distress that's when you were oh no the

Speaker 0 :stress was it was a real stress what
 happened well that's that's a bad story I told you that in when I was afinishing high school as it turns great
 the time I became a champion of Ukraine number one and second in Soviet Unionwhich was a very very big deal after
 that five kids on six no five five kids from Soviet Union was supposed to go tointernational competition and this
 international competition was the same dates as you know exams to enter theuniversity so if you are a champ if you
 are like in five best five best kids in physics five best kids in mathematicsfive best kissin whatever chemistry they
 were able to skip these final exams which means to skip this essay inlanguage one languages say another
 language and you skip all exams but instead of that you prepare tointernational competition so because I
 was number two I was clearly the team so I was not supposed to go to this stupidexams
 and but well but it was a telephone call of our leader from Moscow he said thatlike it's like one week before but
 unfortunately you have to be replaced with another guy because they are unableto give you a visa oh and that was
 actually yeah that was a stress it was it was a very big stress and at thatpoint like people including those from
 America and scientists motion they came to me and they asked me you know to makespeech and just to say something and to
 do something and they talked to my dad to your grandfatherhi he spoke with people from KGB because
 he was like the guy had time and and he came to me and said okay you do whateveryou want because it's your life you make
 a decision but they told me that if you forgot about what happened you have goldmedal which is over there you pass all
 exams and you will have a well five in Russian a highest grade whatever you doit will be a yeah and then you go to any
 university you want and you'll be

Speaker 1 :accepted this is KGB talking those kinds


Speaker 0 :of folks yeah and I hesitate it and I
 said well yeah I agree I am I I will not fight against the system so can you

Speaker 1 :explain a little bit does you being
 Jewish have anything to do with it

Speaker 0 :absolutely it's 100% okay so because it
 was actually it was a 1970 and in this moment it was very significantactually push the immigration for Jewish
 people to Israel and to America and they they were afraid always and they justgive all these awards to the to the guy
 and he will say okay guys goodbye I just decided to go to whatever to America orto Germany or whatever or to Israel
 keeping that in mind just in case they prefer not to give Iza and at that timeinteresting enough is KGB so they do not
 give visa and they do not give any explanation why right just you cannot dothat however however they say he's a
 good guy and if he accepts that will do everything for himdon't worry it's also risk because you
 never know they can but I don't know maybe maybe I am so smart but actuallywithout special preparation I went to
 these super exams and I got a you did well how did well so and that's thereason of this stripe which appeared in
 very short bundes it was a source of

Speaker 1 :stress but I'm not exactly understanding
 the depth of the stress it was very cg / - ways to make I mean it doesn't feellike there's a choice he just had


Speaker 0 :actually when already I made a decision
 I was already with the store okay so the

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :decision process was because I was it's
 like you know I was falling from a limp or whatever like because I I was feelingthat everything is like I'm best of the
 best in the world whatever and boots they actually put me on my place youknow
 it was difficult moment but but then I was accepted and it wasn't you knowimmediately celebration because you know
 I got this gold medal which is a big deal in Soviet Union the gold represents

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :being a valedictorian well it's very
 right

Speaker 1 :so did you experience anti-semitism
 leading up to that moment in your life did you feel that you were what you meanto feel that you were Jewish did you
 experience life as a as a Ukrainian Jew

Speaker 0 :or simply as a Ukrainian well for the


Speaker 1 :listener that is uncomfortable talk
 likes to avoid uncomfortable conversations so I have to force theminto uncomfortable conversations okay oh


Speaker 0 :well it's not only me just like all our
 generation in at that time in Ukraine in Ukraine Ukraine at that time it was notthe same as Ukraine today so level of
 anti-semitism was way higher in Ukraine than in other places in other soviet

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :republics all right why is that


Speaker 1 :is there any historical yes reason


Speaker 0 :phalanges well it was actually
 historical significantly historical reason starting from bogdan Olinsky soat some point a couple of hundred years
 before that Jews they supported polish people and it was against Russia againstthe grain so just a level of
 anti-semitism was very high in this kind of countries also this area was insideof Pale of Settlement which was a lot of
 Jews a lot of Jews a lot of problem with Jews in Moscow it was forbidden for Jewsto leave so no no Jews no problems so
 when I actually moved from Kiev to Moscow it is like a day and night soMoscow it was beautiful I mean I did not
 feel well I feel felt but not my charity in Ukraine always I felt thatI am Jewish but from another hand you
 remember all these kids from our yard like a stone that's that they're opposedboth groups a were Jewish yeah
 so what I'm trying to say that Jews they lived actually together so from thatpoint of view you know it's less it's a
 huge anti-semitism but but they are

Speaker 1 :somewhere you're somewhat isolated from


Speaker 0 :it because because it's like a Jewish


Speaker 1 :gigantic together I mean they juice it


Speaker 0 :was its historical ghetto yeah okay


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :let's let's jump back okay we were


Speaker 1 :saying that you were born and raised in
 Kiev what what are your favorite or maybe most representative memories of

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :your dad and mom from the earlier years


Speaker 0 :well it was a beautiful family you're
 the only chance you're just i was only charged one yes and my father he was ahero of World War two and he was
 actually always with a stick because you know he was like a cane yeah cane righthe was heavily wounded even in the war
 and he operated the the gun the machine

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :gun he's a goner very complicated
 situations huh so he was risking his life enormousLee and the only reason he survived
 because he was heavily wounded so just it was the end of the war for him andyou know and as a boy you know for me he
 was eerie and he was a real hero he was like you know it's not it's verydifferent for me he's like a big hand
 you know like always he was not drinking Japanese whiskey he was drinking onlyone thing what yeah he remember like we
 had somewhere this yeah we'll get to the bar yeah but what I'm trying to say thatit's a different personality
 and he just from this Jewish boy he became an associate minister ofconstruction of Ukraine which was a very
 big deal so he was like this he's very much different from me I'm like a littlebit like a software personality my like
 my mother but he was a very tough guy yeah were you afraid of him hmmwhat does mean to be afraid he loved me
 but he was a person like you know very strong personality so yes well if I didsomething wrong how you remember the
 story no no I mean these idiots from

Speaker 1 :another from the yeah in this rockets so


Speaker 0 :yes I was afraid of my father so I had
 huge respect and my mother she was like a nice Jewish mother and it well let me

Speaker 1 :kind of ask a hard question to you've
 lost your dad a few years ago yeah what did it feel like when you learned that

Speaker 0 :he died what went through your head


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :what memories well like you know losing
 your parents it's excluding your parents so I would say what I can say it's alosing paradin and my father it was a
 whole generation you know it's just like and you know the feeling you have thatnow you are the man that's interesting
 whether the killing is now it's my trying to be great now just I have to dosomething now just because when you have
 your parents you always have this feeling that there is something behindyou just in case yeah and my father he
 was very very very strong personality just this interesting story that duringthis
 mmm Jews persecution in 1952 by Stalin when it was so-called a fair of doctorsor whatever how to say in English
 deliberately when Jewish people were actually said just their doctors andokay most of nocturnal were Jewish
 Wesley so they used to say that they actually kill half of the government orwhatever as a doctors it was absolutely
 lie it just says nothing with reality and Jews they were prepared actually tobe moved from all over so it Union to be
 a began to like a close to Chinese border on a more River like oh it'salready they try to move them closer to
 Japan to Japan is whiskey so like in

Speaker 1 :camps know what just just just just kind
 of move them straight to to the so

Speaker 0 :called the Jewish published Jewish
 region or whatever but it's like it was nothing there yeah and if you move likethis kind of group of people I was about
 three million Jews not forget you know at least half will die just during thismoving so it was nice and you're


Speaker 1 :preventing them from having a future


Speaker 0 :yeah so at that time you know people
 they kept start kept talking about the same stupid stuff that Jews a drinkblood of babies of Christian babies yeah
 and and that's what my father used to say that his friends and it's like youknow it's like a meeting and you know
 people are asking have you seen something have you seen him like adrinking blood or something like that
 and he said that he was absolutely in products to his friends and all of themthey mostly I mean they are or either
 leaving the room just not to participate in this stupidity war they say wehaven't seen but who knows if people
 they write in newspapers is a very strong propagandaso they he lost he was a associate
 director of this manufacturing plant and they say that he's supposed to leave

Speaker 1 :because because this whole propaganda
 he's a Jew and choose a drink in the blood of Christian babymaybe maybe who knows yes maybe it's


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :enough there's no evidence that they're
 not yes right so so he is not going to

Speaker 0 :prison but he is not going to work in
 our enterprise so he said okay I am like a social director and I want to be aworker a simplest worker but because I
 love my plants he said no so actually he left it was what was that memory

Speaker 1 :standout for you why because it was it


Speaker 0 :was 1952 and I was born in 1953 so just
 so what was happening that he was without job for one year because nobodywanted to to take him before Stalin died
 in 1953 it was home and when I was born so my mother she worked to support thewhole family and we lived in a small
 room 14 square meters it was my grandmother grandfather father motherand me so the I mean the it's kind of it
 was a big impact on and then Stalin died and everything become way better is and

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :in terms of anti-semitism as well you
 see there is a good movie by the way made here in America a Russian Jews part1 and Jews / - lysandros part 3 I think


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :it's a Youtube version yeah so what is
 that it was almost no anti-semitism beforeWorld War 2 right it was very strong
 anti-semitism after the end of the World War 2and in 1945 and death of Stalin in 1953
 in 1953 serration become better but not as good way not as good as in thenineteen thirties


Speaker 1 :why was there anti-semitism after the
 war the Second World War

Speaker 0 :it seems the idea hearted Russia sorry


Speaker 1 :to interrupt
 how did Russians in your memory think about the the the cruelty of theHolocaust because there's so much pride
 about Russia winning the war of being the you know to getting to Berlin isn'thow do you think about the people that


Speaker 0 :were tortured well well I read it very
 strong very strong propaganda propaganda very strong propaganda so what happenedthat okay what actually happened that in
 the end of okay before World War two yeah before world war ii actually jewishpeople they just they forgot that
 they're Jews it was mmm I mean they were all Soviet like a little bit firstSoviet first on way way first I mean it
 was before work in the end of the war Jewish people they create a lot ofspecial organizations and because of
 Holocaust they had significant support of United States of America and Westerncountries but most United States of
 America and Jewish people in the end of over tool they start thinking that it'slike my story with this when I graduated
 from high school so they started believing that they arebig guys you know because I have so much
 support from the United States and it's also and and on top of that like acherry it was a creation of Israel


Speaker 1 :and right I was around and so and I did
 49 there's a kind of a push that Jews are no longer Soviets they their

Speaker 0 :homeland is yes and and Jews a felt like
 a initially very nice but they overdid itso bottom line it was a and also don't
 not to forget about Hitler so as a result level of anti-semitism in from1945 to 1953 was growing significantly
 then it was a little bit better but actually significant improvement startshappening only in 1960s not earlier than


Speaker 1 :that so can you talk a little bit more
 about your dad's journey in World War 2 I mean there's I remember a bunch ofstories but you know just for people
 interested you know is World War two is at the core of our family in a sense socan you just linger and maybe if you
 have memories about it his impact how did he get injured was his relationshipswith you know violence with death was
 bullets flying everywhere

Speaker 0 :yeah my father he was born in 1923
 so in night and we're in Minsk in Minsk which is now with Russia and he was bornin October so when world war started he
 was 17 and it was forbidden to go to army if you are younger than 18 sotogether with his friends they may
 change in a spurt they just change their year from theymade themselves one year older just to
 be accepted to the army and interesting enough that like the way I understand atleast these people who organized like a
 army they understand they saw that this boys are younger but they let go he

Speaker 1 :wanted to go what he wanted to go you
 know there's so many stories and you know more in America where there'sthere's a lot of people brave people who
 found ways to not go yeah here it's

Speaker 0 :absolutely opposite
 it's absolutely opposite because most well not not everybody over this one butmajority propaganda was extremely strong
 so protecting your father and mother one

Speaker 1 :its he was to die for your country yes
 yes yes

Speaker 0 :so to die for your country it was kind
 of like an honor yeah that's and also they were surethat's Red Army his hungry trans
 stronger than this Germans yeah so and they thought that okay we'll go there socouple of months and we are winners but
 in one way or another but they were wanted to go especially when you knowyou're not like a very rich guy you know
 so he went to the army and it was like a couple of months special preparation tobecome
 like a lowest level of officers so junior latent or whatever it is inthis country and he became like this
 low-level officer and he starts actually I near Moscow and just start going backand back and back and back and and
 that's it and he was with this machine gun big one and you know the change oflike it was very fast so people they
 were killed very very very fast actually

Speaker 1 :people that were operating machine guns
 yeah

Speaker 0 :ah very very fast because just finish


Speaker 1 :the changeover


Speaker 0 :change so he became division commander
 reasonably fast decision region that's

Speaker 1 :one way to move up on everybody's dying


Speaker 0 :yeah yeah yeah yeah and what he kept
 saying I think even to you because he just itwas like he kept saying that for some
 reason he was absolutely sure that every year he saw that like everybody else hadkilled and he's not so he was kind of
 sure that something is protecting him

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :he's invincible and yes he's invincible
 he he and I wasn't writing and he was

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :very strong actually very very very
 strong like by the way physically and mentally

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :physically and mentally so kind of like
 helix I mean he is like because this dude would not like myself but he isvery
 physically strong and mentally protected like I don't know what best way to saythat he's he was sure in himself and he


Speaker 1 :was sure that there's a confidence is


Speaker 0 :that yeah yeah yeah no no no it's not
 it's a confidence it's a constant a little bit like a kind of like areligious but here he he did not believe
 to the gap through the first place come but he believed in what he was to say inhis star services there is a star which
 protects him and I be right and he might be right

Speaker 1 :he survived war he got he survived war


Speaker 0 :because after like for no like five or
 six months he was heavily wounded which was very good yeah actually becausethat's right he's right in the leg in


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the leg yeah so he was like and he had a
 lot of this horse

Speaker 1 :do you remember what about the people in
 general you know 20 million plus Soviet people died what impact do you rememberwhat impact the war had on the people is


Speaker 0 :enormous enormous that's why for 20
 million it is a lot and it's a need I

Speaker 1 :half of them were just civilians because


Speaker 0 :Stalin he just operated this war without
 counting people yeah but do you think it

Speaker 1 :had powerful creative impact in terms of
 music art literature the science a sad thing about war all all of the above

Speaker 0 :science mostly all of the above it
 because even before war science was very much pushed up but after the warscientists they were considered like the
 key people in the world especially military scientist

Speaker 1 :I don't think I've ever asked you this I
 haven't asked you most of the things I'm

Speaker 0 :asking but you're Jewish Hitler killed a


Speaker 1 :lot of Jews how did you feel about the
 Holocaust I don't think we've actually really talked about is it just anintellectual tragedy to you or did it


Speaker 0 :ever feel I know I but what do you think


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :about human nature after that who is he
 that I have parents and my parents they have parents which my grandparents andthey're my great-grandparents so all of
 those all of those without exception were killed in Holocaust zero died withtheir own death natural death all of
 them they were killed because they were like already a little bit older like Iam now and they were sure that Germans
 they will not touch them come on just do something to old people itself strangeand all of them without exception all of
 know they were killed so it is you know like initially in my life I just it waslike a really hatred with respect to
 Germans in general which only later I mean it was clear that it's not it's notsay it's not German in Germany but
 that's but it was very serious feelings

Speaker 1 :about that so hatred but so as you as
 you grew grew up did it are you hopeful about whether people aregood or evil and did that have a impact
 on you know the fact that you can see so much evil you can become cynicalthe way you still did you is there still
 an optimistic positive person inside you

Speaker 0 :yeah there is
 I am optimistic myself I am optimistic so just like the point is that like Iwas when I just start growing up even
 even in high school level of anti-semitism was like a way lower andin general I felt myself always way more
 Soviet then I was a Russian Ukrainian or Jewish sureso what what was your relationship of


Speaker 1 :the Soviet Union we'll talk about coming
 to America but what was your feeling so

Speaker 0 :you're proud for it for many years I was
 very proud I was very proud of this style of life where science is reallypopular where people they're working not
 for money but people are working for form to make something interesting tomake something good it's the place where
 if you if you if you're good you are rewarded and that was a healing it waspropaganda obviously so for like when I
 was in high school middle school high school and I would say in school I wasfeeling that I'm extremely proud
 so again then it was this shock change and then a lot of friends I startedgoing to Israel or America so just
 everything start changing every since I've chased after Stalin

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :after though it's you know it's wait so
 it's already I'm talking about like 1970s in the 70s yeahthe 1970s already like people they
 against our feeling that they're Jewish because of significant immigration toAmerica and Israel okay say you were in


Speaker 1 :Kiev through high school mmm-hmm so
 let's look to your next chapter of your life and can you tell me what is fistyeah since as its I don't even know what
 the full in English name is Moscow

Speaker 0 :Institute of Physics and technology and


Speaker 1 :what is it in Russian the full name


Speaker 0 :Moskovsky facility hsk Institute em fat


Speaker 1 :I um it's it smells like MIT police yeah


Speaker 0 :yeah yeah my PT yes yeah yeah it is am i
 P TSD kind of it's a kind of a mighty I

Speaker 1 :don't know it's maybe a little more like
 a Caltech oh no I was there an engineering component it's very smallright I mean what was it was the size of


Speaker 0 :a cultic and it was very much focused on
 science and military science and now

Speaker 1 :sorry to interrupt no this was in Moscow
 yeah and so you came from Kiev the

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :Moscow Moscow so how did you get into DC
 so what yeah so you said this yeah cause this stuff is focused on sciencemilitary science this is like the I saw
 on the internet this description of maybe you can talk to it math andphysics education at MIT the number of
 hours I think or compared to fist yeah and they were I mean they were makingfirst of all the CCF education is
 shorter and covers a like an order of

Speaker 0 :magnitude more material yes exactly


Speaker 1 :what can you explain what what that
 experience is like what the with their idea of the kind of holiday they'reputting you through is what the
 philosophy but that is what I've been

Speaker 0 :looking for because you know don't
 forget that well you're coming to the place and you feel yourself best in theworld and when you meet people from you
 know outside you're like a you're like a different personality you are from miptyou are from from Castilla so it was a
 lot of songs a lot of it was a theory and we were so much proud that number ofcredit hours
 it was incredibly we work from 9:00 to 5:00 each day you can from 9:00 to 5:00it is eight hours so it's eight hours of
 classes how many days a week six days a week so you can count and it's and thelevel was and your requirements they're
 very very very very strong and it is

Speaker 1 :math physics chemistry what was the
 range of subjects important twice

Speaker 0 :importantly like anyway when you enter
 like a you start with very high level mathematics physics and chemistryactually and why did you want to call


Speaker 1 :this yeah so it's basically because you
 thought you were one of the best people in the world at math and physics yeah sothis is the place to go and chemistry


Speaker 0 :yes in chemistry and that's that's
 that's the way to go by the way when I came to Moscow I hesitated for about oneday because I also I was in love with
 mathematics and mathematics meant like a freedom so they had less classes theywere more open for
 like creative thinking well this jacket was like a what's the best word to saywhat they do like in sports like um make
 like something extremely hard for you laterwhat's the name how you say for military
 for military from either and USA boot

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :camp yeah when I said boot camp but yeah


Speaker 1 :this is really intense so innocence of


Speaker 0 :weeding out week yes and that was going
 on actually so the significant number of students they were actually living afterthe first semester yeah it was extremely
 challenging also keep in mind that it was about okay usually group it was likea twenty five people thirty and usually
 one girl so it is like a whatever they three percent girls ninety seven boysit's also create very special atmosphere


Speaker 1 :well it's maybe just two before before
 we get into the special atmosphere what was your journey to fish yeah likeso I think I read a book a love and math
 by ad Frankel also Russian I think he mentions he stuck in there and he's alsoJewish and he said that there's a lot of
 anti-semitism that that there's a bunch of schools that you weren't I mean itwas either explicitly or implicitly no


Speaker 0 :Jews allowed yeah well so did you


Speaker 1 :so what was the process of getting into
 this place and how much anti-semitism was there one in that picture at that

Speaker 0 :period it was 1970 it was a clear
 well it's anti-semitism yes absolutely what but what I mean that it was like afor Jews it was really difficult to get
 into the universities very simple but in most of universities the rule was kindof hidden so just it was like a Jewish
 boy and not Jewish boy and they were going to the same exam and the professorgives like a G or C for the Jewish guy
 and like B or a for for a not Jewish guy if their level is the same it was justin most of places but Moscow means the
 physics and technology it was very different exams they were absolutelyhonest however however they count grades
 it was two exams in physics and two exams in mathematics oral mathematicsgreat mathematics or physics written
 discs a b c g and a is 5 B is 4G 3G is 2 and if you're Jewish an exam they werevery very very very very very tough yeah


Speaker 1 :the world I hear all of them and that


Speaker 0 :was written and oral they were extremely
 challenged but equally for doesn't matter you are Jewish or not Jewishwhere iam now if you are Jewish you have
 to have to to go through that after have either 19 or 20 which means yeah whichmeans it should be a a a a or
 one day well if you are not Jewish 17 is absolutely ok 16some people 15 some people so it was


Speaker 1 :made clear and this beside that is


Speaker 0 :completely fair it was you know it was
 from some point of view it was good because it is not like a cheating it waslike a clear rule let's do it all so it
 was very interesting that after exams it was a special interview and wasinterviewers
 with really high level scientists it was like it two or three famous famousfamous scientists and one or two KGB
 people and and they just you know managed this operation it is impossibleto discuss so they say yes you are
 accepted great Cory they say no you're notwhy that's our decision so what was your


Speaker 1 :favorite subject topic ideas that you
 fell in love with in in the first few years of this year it was general

Speaker 0 :physics because we had absolutely
 beautiful a lecture and a half his books even now I have over there he wrote likea lot of books solution see booking yeah
 and he was very interesting personality I wasn't laughed with him for I wouldsay two years no more than that because
 his idea was you have to present physics absolutely without calculus so it shouldbe no derivatives and no integration


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :how's how's that possible just do you do


Speaker 1 :physics you can most you say physics you
 mean like mechanics oh no no no no no

Speaker 0 :physics means physics it's mechanics
 it's a thermal sciences its electricity optics and nuclear physics everythingMODOK ever was that okay the only thing
 he didn't attach it was no quantum

Speaker 1 :mechanics was quantum mechanics in the
 air back then yeah obvious but not for

Speaker 0 :this gentleman
 not for this professor he was not so much he was no famous scientist he was afamous teacher and then only then I just
 you know jump to the world of theoretical physicsand and chemistry so and that the next
 step in my life is just jumping into theoretical physics and what what branch

Speaker 1 :of theoretical physics were you
 interested in so I've never actually heard you talk much about the world is

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :the big like general relativity so
 looking out into the Stars you were more interested in like what physicsphenomena were you interested in now or


Speaker 0 :that that so at that time at that time
 after this two years with civilian I just changed completely to absolutelyopposite approach to purely theoretical
 physics and at that time the most popular it was the so-called run downminimum so run down ten books and they
 are believe me they are Wow so they are so hard yeah they are justfor some reasons areas you know hardest
 of the hardest like very challenging very difficult and it's the boy is sojust they say if you want to show
 yourself you have to go to the so-called endowment we should have to go throughten exams actually eleven because the
 first one is was mathematics and then whatever physics one physics to physicsten and you know it was a challenge it
 was very difficult I went through that just actually I don't know just to proveyeah that I can do that to be honest I
 did not in the end at least I hate that because it was mm not so muchit is not fine one you know it is just
 something opposite to that do the

Speaker 1 :opposite yeah yeah but it's it's painful
 almost for the sake of being painful yes

Speaker 0 :it's like it's like you are doing the
 martial arts yeah that's just to show you yourself that you cando that yeah so that's what I did and
 then when I was actually I was keep doing that but in the middle it was thefirst time when I came to Kolkata means
 to the photonic energy so speaking of

Speaker 1 :which what is the couch out of Institute
 of atomic energy and who was your so I feel like in VCF there's an advisormm-hmm so who was your advisor who were
 the mentors in in this period of your

Speaker 0 :life uh most greens the physics and
 technology it's very interesting approach it's a so-called physics systemyeah what does it mean it means at first
 three years you work in classes and then you go to actual national labs and youchoose them they choose us etc and three
 years you work there and you listen to the classes but these classes they arenot from teachers not from teaching
 professors but from very very high level actual scientists so and who was so who

Speaker 1 :was the the person who was the person
 that you connected with who was your advisors in that fourth year fifth year

Speaker 0 :yeah well and what's coach Atif so


Speaker 1 :that's one of that's that's the


Speaker 0 :connection yeah yeah cool chatter it's


Speaker 1 :that's downtown Moscow right oh yeah


Speaker 0 :yeah cool shot of its the guy is like a
 father of Russian atomic bomb and he build a bigger actor in central Moscowthe interest and all that it was in
 nineteen in 1919 1946 I think you know they do the first rector and then thebump and 1949 so and it was a it's it's
 you know like in America there is a group of national labs different likeOak Ridge National Lab Los Alamos
 National Lab Argonne National Lab etcetera in Russia I would say most ofthis lab they were combined together in
 this one Kolkata Institute of atomic energy soit's like you can imagine like a
 combination of most of American national labs in one place it was fifteenthousand people working there fifteen
 thousands a huge it's like a sitting inside of city and when they werecreated they were focused on nuclear
 physics and nuclear engineering and everything around development to buildatomic bomb and the same thing for
 [Music] fusion bombs so for hydrogen bound andbut later they add solid phase physics
 groups etc so yes it was a I would say any still now the most I would say thestrongest research center and also with
 you so I decided to go there and I decided to go to plasma so in January in1972 I came to they did not let me
 inside of crucial minutes I came only to the gate and I met my first professorwho brought me there it was professor
 Liang he threw the coffe he is now professor emeritus of University ofMaryland I saw him couple of years ago
 was that and he brought me to his house and he we spoke and just he said I justremember forever he he told me you want
 it's like a the story with winnie pooh andhe said you wanna tea with milk or with
 honey or and and my answer was exactly the same as we needed poo I did not talkwe need opposed that time I say okay
 all of the above please because why because you're hungry very simple and hespoke to me and he started working it
 was and I made my first actually paper

Speaker 1 :you wrote your first paper that's who
 you were and I was on plasma

Speaker 0 :it wasn't asthma and but then in the
 half of a year he told me that he likes what we are doing but he will be unableto help me in the life because I am
 Jewish and to a Jewish person even like absolutely brilliant to get inside ofcourse Chetta you have a stronger
 helpers and he recommend me to meet lagina rusinovand very early glasses at that moment so
 it was a moment when I start new names I

Speaker 1 :know well because of the song as this
 legendary so because of you I seem to have met a lot of people from fist yeahyeah
 and much like MIT they're never shy about telling you that they're from fistyeah there's a lot of pride so I notice
 on the fall maybe you can tell about him the other guy let me guess the gossipwhen a lot of people these days know
 from the show of Chernobyl who is but he obviously has deep roots and coachesoften is a very interesting person so
 okay so rusinov who's this legendary human that I've heard so much about well

Speaker 0 :with you know that plasma fusion plasma
 Elysian talked only like making it stock market it is diagnostic such ameasurement characterization so the most
 challenging is how to measure it so Rose onif was world accepted as a father ofplasma diagnostics
 so he was a very very very nice person working with plasma diagnostics boththeory and experiments and at that time
 in 1973 approximately oh he decided he was asked by League Asif to start plasmachemistry not plasma physics but plasma
 chemistry because they wanted to dissociate uranium hexafluoride andplutonium hexafluoride and they were
 unable to do it without like in traditional ways and they decided writeplasma so and rusinov agreed to take a
 lead in plasma chemistry and at that point you see that I was in a good butgood moment you know in a good place so
 I was lucky actually because all of them they were physicists especially Roshanof deeply deeply deeply physicists and
 he needs help from a good young person who is not afraid of chemistry beingphysicist so he looked around and
 rudakov told him that there is a young guy very interesting personality he is agood and physics but he's in laughs
 chemistry also so try him and to me he said go to row serif he's a tough guybut but he will be able to help you
 because to help you to stay to go further in your life because his closefriend working together with Li Gosselin
 ligase was associate director vice-president of course Adam Instituteso that's how it's all started and they
 asked me a couple of things can you do this can you do that in chemistry so itis just physicists and talking chemistry


Speaker 1 :so let me step up because I'd like to
 step back in a little bit to talk about of what is plasma even so but before allthat let's talk about ourselves so what


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :let's step away from science what impact
 did he have on you as a human being what memories do you have of him that youlove or hate or both you know I would


Speaker 0 :say the best word would be both because
 do you remember Ross on of hard to know

Speaker 1 :what I remember because I just told me


Speaker 0 :story personality he's the personality
 he's he's extremely tough very quiet he is mostly not talking he's only lookingat you always in your eyes he's like
 well that's his brilliant smart he was

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :absolutely smart absolutely brilliant so
 you can have very tough and tough and so

Speaker 1 :you have to basically makes for a great
 adviser because this is a person to be

Speaker 0 :afraid of


Speaker 1 :yeah and you have to put you basically
 for the rest of your life are trying to prove yourself to him yes that's exactly

Speaker 0 :the case with a condition lady met
 rusinov yeah that's the personality yeah is

Speaker 1 :there a memory a story that stands out
 to you maybe that represents him well without going

Speaker 0 :to science right without I remember one
 story just forever one of the I was already not a postdoc well gradedstudent so it was one under grade a
 student you remember from third grade and muskiness physical ecology and shewas supposed to start you know after
 vacations she came but but something happened and she came about one weeklater so it's her advisor which is
 another famous scientist and I was in an office of Mazzara so he brought thisgirl and it's a nice girl I had not so
 many girls in EM IPT Investec not so many girls so she came to this officeand rusinov
 he just look at her like a snake you know likelook at her without any words for about
 maybe the one in 30 seconds just look at her eyes and then she said he said yourcolleagues they start working on the
 wiki though your what your colleagues well other student yeah other studentsthey are already working start working
 one week ago that's all he said and kept looking at her just staring and staringright and she you know like his ears
 started going from her face yeah and it was like a torture its he did injured by

Speaker 1 :silence and staring yes yeah that's a


Speaker 0 :good like a three three minutes but even
 for me it was like maybe one hour for her maybe it's like whole life okay

Speaker 1 :let's go to the most important question
 how did you meet mom whoo

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :so this is before coach shot off I


Speaker 0 :suppose around that nine it's no it is
 already i met mom in 1973 this is second

Speaker 1 :third fourth year of yours


Speaker 0 :well this was my third year no it was my
 fourth year actually already and for mom it was a second one she was there yeah I

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :told you that it's like three percent so
 she was one of the girls on it being one

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :of the special few in this special and
 yeah and she survived this kind of fall so super training divided first year she

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :survived everything yeah I mean so how


Speaker 1 :did how did you okay so there you are
 part of the 97% yeah with a giant ego as we can already tellby the way does your ego serve you well
 we'll talk about a little yeah more if you like yes I think yes what about soin science yes I think people will hear
 that you have a bit of an ego but I think it's theinto your it's the same with five
 minutes the same with I just Leonard Susskinda lot of physicists have this weird
 dance with ego it's a useful weapon when you wield a cautiously but did it helpyou in terms of with mom I would not say


Speaker 0 :so about confidence
 well how did you the most difficult yeah is you know to to go to this becauseit's a boy so and and girls they live
 separately in different like this place

Speaker 1 :these are alligators and like what I


Speaker 0 :mean after you have to be clever and how
 to get to this like a place I mean yeah ah so what happened that on their floorsomething disappeared I don't know some
 money or whatever or some books or something and and a friend of mine hewas you know like I would say dreaming
 he we used to say so he was like a student responsible for like everythingshould be nice so I said that I will
 help you let's go to these girls and let's try to to help them so we come emstart helping and spend then the whole
 night reading poetry just reading poetry I think with tea that's it

Speaker 1 :reading poetry with tea was you and who
 else

Speaker 0 :me mom and to my friends and it was also
 two other girls which leaves the same so

Speaker 1 :do you remember what poems you're really
 is there something if you can imagine if

Speaker 0 :we are talking about eight hours or
 whatever in seven hours so it was a lot of for three but is it

Speaker 1 :there's there something from that period
 that stands out to you maybe as poetry

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :that you were reading not something
 you've written for mom yet but do you remember from that night I mean it's an

Speaker 0 :important night right yeah oh they


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :remember what kind of tea the cheap one
 because this song is stuff we used to

Speaker 1 :handle vodka so no no so ok tea and it's


Speaker 0 :like a it was offensive for girls we had
 a huge respect to that and then

Speaker 1 :gentlemen don't drink vodka in fair


Speaker 0 :enough so at least in the beginning so


Speaker 1 :when did you first fall in love with mom


Speaker 0 :yeah you know when you have like you
 said it's 97 percent so jay-z important it's immediately one two three yes okayso but she she was beautiful and she's
 beautiful and it was December 14th and still even now we celebrate this big

Speaker 1 :summer for teens when you met yeah


Speaker 0 :well that's this poetry stuff but is it
 was the same day was to wait December 14

Speaker 1 :two days ago


Speaker 0 :so we celebrated 46 years what is today
 this is you met of this day was tea and

Speaker 1 :poetry but like it there also guitar I


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :think yes and when you say guitar I mean
 there's a bar tradition as basically poetry to music yeah any kind of lyricsis really important yeah I would say it


Speaker 0 :was 96 percent it was mostly lyrics and
 guitar it was just like

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :how did you win her over oh that's
 that's that what's your secret

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :what how'd you do it uh actually also I


Speaker 0 :became her mentor which made my life a
 little bit easier and you know I started with poetry and I end up with scienceand then actually and we stay together
 we married three years after that do you

Speaker 1 :remember any poems you've written her


Speaker 0 :well I'm not no not of course you never


Speaker 1 :say it when I would for 30 years but at


Speaker 0 :that moment I would say like reciting
 all this life poems it's probably not the best stuff to do now it should be aspecial discussion about that probably
 together with her okay what I can say that I have a couple of this bookbooklets on poetry but it is already not
 the same I was already not the same it was in in high school which means at thetime already
 most of my poetry was I would say not funny but more like yeah woody playful

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah yeah yeah okay when did you


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :know you will marry her when did you
 know that you know sort of this is this is gonna be it's the one you remember

Speaker 0 :this one two three yeah maybe not during
 first five minutes but maybe after 20 minutes yeah I'm gonna marry that one

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :yeah it is very I mean she she she she
 is beautiful and she was even shocked she was youngerme too so just almost immediately but it
 was clear that we cannot do you know immediately so we're waitinguntil I graduate from from from from
 I'm not on the gorilla from master level because you know in Soviet Union it wasundergraduate class master it was like
 higher education and after that it was PhD levels just we wait until I'm donethe semester when did you first learn


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :that you will be a father some four


Speaker 1 :people don't know I have an older
 brother uglier fatter stupider blood and

Speaker 0 :Greg oh he's good


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :just uglier now he's doing 1977 it's no
 he was born in 1978 so it was not an easy moment for me I would say even verydifficult moment because it was a
 concept in Soviet Union which is difficult to to understand here the socalled for a pisco it's just even not
 possible to translate which means that you have to have a special absolutelycomplicated permission and normally
 complicated mission to live in Moscow and Leningrad which is in somePetersburg now so to do that you have to
 either have to be born there and that's it actually so it was a close series soand I was from Kiev and mom
 she was a she is from Malaysia so just how to do that in 1976 1977 I was likethe first grade of PhD first year of PhD
 and without this permission to live in Moscow so just it was a difficult momentthis is a practical thing because you


Speaker 1 :want to you want to stay in Moscow
 longer term long because yeah because in

Speaker 0 :Soviet Union Moscow it was like a number
 one place but mostly easy times this permission that's extremely complicated

Speaker 1 :and because mom is originally from a
 different area of the Soviet Union yeah and there's called as complicationsbureaucracy all that kind of she was


Speaker 0 :born she lived in the area for first
 uranium the most important uranium mines in Soviet Union so that's she's fromwearisome so what and that's where you


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :were he was perfect yeah yeah nuclear


Speaker 1 :that explains so much so how did it feel
 like when one greg was born means just becoming a father what was that storylike so yes it's a pain I was very much


Speaker 0 :well obviously I was very happy but I
 was nervous about future because future was not clear at that time not clear atall about this time my situation was
 actually very sophisticated well it's a little bit long story butwhat happened that I get sick and and
 they did not know where to put me it was infectious and and finally I end up inthe house of Sahara which is interesting
 moment and was mixed all together with Greg births with me being sick with withthe sire of all together whatever it was


Speaker 1 :like a vista mess it's just just a


Speaker 0 :stressful mess yeah and when I came to
 get onto this scoffs to the city and middle Asia in near now they call iturgent
 oh so it is near her gentle well I was very happy and one of the first hour atthat point I wrote my first not book but
 chapter in the book and the walls the

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :topic plasma chemistry
 plasma chemistry and topic of my chapter it was synthesis of nitrogen oxide fromair and there is a very famous I love it
 the picture of Greg on the wall when he just you know a couple of weeks and he's

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :read in the book and he's in front and
 he's just like so much interest and he's reading this plasma chemistry book yeah

Speaker 1 :it's a good picture
 it's a good picture right so how did it feel like so obviously Greg is adisappointment
 so how did it feel like when I was finally born oh this you it was a it was

Speaker 0 :way of course way easier and we were way
 more happier because it was 1983 so which means that we were already inMoscow we got this practice can we got
 this permission and we got and our apartment so just everything wasso nice and so beautiful and and you
 know cherry on top of this cake it was you and and the only funny story whichis like always mom she used to say is
 like for some reason I don't know even why but everybody were sure that you area girl and not you but like that is the
 girl the girl yeah and so everything was prepared for a girl and and we werestaying and near this clinic and me and
 Greg and just and it was now that it is a boy and Greg he mentioned his famousfriend that he's so much happy that
 you're a boy and you know the story also that he was five years old and he wasfor some reason sure that to that man
 they make poison and women they make girls and he was so much surprising hesaid that man she's so good it was


Speaker 1 :impressed yes that she could make a boy


Speaker 0 :a boy yeah yeah so that were you ready
 to be a father would you say it you know being father it's a big commitmentbig big big commitment because now it's
 a real family when Greg was born it was like oh my [ __ ] was a mess so it wasvery challenging it was very difficult
 when you were like a fun and nice and everybody they're so happy and even ifyou look at pictures you know like a
 picture with you that just yes the

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :following is the smiling it's a happy
 bring joy to the world

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :yes and basically that's the way you
 were when they were like you were always you know you wake up you smile that'sgood it's a good sign very good well


Speaker 1 :let's go let's go
 so I I wanted to be a psychiatrist selling me psychoanalyze youdo you think you were a good dad who


Speaker 0 :well to be honest it's not for me to
 judge what I am but I can tell you that my whole lifeI just tried sometimes more successful
 sometimes less successful to be good dad that it's not for me to judgeI mean you know I can give an example
 like when Greg was very young for me like a very important was on Dow booksand I had these 10 books often Dow by
 the way there are now there but here they're in my officeand you know that's the books which I
 read and just I put my yeah sweat blood

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :and sweat and blood and tears right into
 this book and what Greg did he just took these books and he took like a thisflowmaster what is that like Oh markers
 markers markers and he everything around is like a the cover of this he drew on

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :it no he just
 it's like graffiti it's like it's all over this and it was how to say you knowfor me it was not a good night is sacred
 I mean yeah and I was just I remember this moment I was so much not happy justyou know and I just try to explain and I
 mean and I ain't even and Greg he keeps saying even now that that he won't he hewas sure that he is doing something good
 that he's just you know that I love these books so he tried to make themeven you know
 prettier prettier yeah that's so what I'm trying to say thatwelcome to being a dad right there yes


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :yes yes


Speaker 1 :so if you can go back and do something
 different in terms of being a dad what

Speaker 0 :would you is there something you regret
 well you know I would say people they're differentsome people they always say they want a
 different life and they sure for some reason that if they start again it wouldbe better it is not my case for some
 reason I don't know maybe this is just like internal friends just to put likeyou mention about Fineman but I just
 always try to protect myself and family and just I was sure like my fatherduring the war that if I am strong
 everything will be good but and as a result believe me or notand it's psychologically it helped me
 psychologically significantly I really believe that I am always right which iswhich is strange maybe yeah but it is
 the way to protect myself I don't know protect family so when you ask me whatyou would be differently nothing my
 feeling always is that my son is the best one I always try to give it rightsometimes more than necessary and
 probably it's I'm doing that wrong but but I can not do differently I am I'msure that I'm right it's a kind of


Speaker 1 :defense mechanism so you fast like so
 you don't you our family have done a lot to make a better life or for us for meand I think I've seen you work very hard
 to take steps through life to do make a better life for all of us with you Chris

Speaker 0 :many times
 and there is a feeling that looks like everything is okay okay okay so while

Speaker 1 :creating sort of creating taking risks
 but creating opportunities for our family for me for my brother there was

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :to me always I felt a distance so what
 if I told you you felt distant to me as a father and then I never really feltclose to you to this day do you think


Speaker 0 :that's true I don't know what I'm what I
 can say that I tried as much as possible to be as good father as they can it'ssometimes it's difficult to combine the
 system with this self-protection like it said um so that's you know so there's an

Speaker 1 :interesting it could be a Russian
 immigrant thing it could be a Jewish thing too but sort of say if you'recaptain of a boat or something and you
 see you have somebody precious your family on the boat it seems that youwere more focused on just making sure
 the boat doesn't crash or like sort of focusing on or maybe getting a biggerboat or the for the fail at like there's
 this focus of the journey in providing and stability and so on then then notactually and not sitting down and
 enjoying time on the boat that you've

Speaker 0 :built you know I have with with with a


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :family I agree with you but it is not
 Russian it is not Russian it's the Jewish and it's immigrantsbecause so many times I was very nervous
 that one thing goes wrong and everything crashes and there are the million thingsin our life but I am always feeling this
 point is the most dangerous dangerous here that is okay that is okay that'sthat's dangerous so I feel this danger
 and I am overdoing this nervousness and it is always with me and that's why even

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :now at any point I am too much nervous
 because I see it looks like my feeling is that like people they do not see thatthis is a deadly point like a crucial
 battle neck or whatever yeah and and and I know that if I say that directlypeople it can be not good so I have to
 play with that in one way or another and so but I would say that it's a typicalfor Jewish people because they went
 through hundreds and hundreds and hundreds even a thousand years ofproblems and also for immigrants because
 that's immigrant life you remember your own story was high school and the firsttime came there I mean there is some
 kind of tiny details which can make your life miserable

Speaker 1 :yeah middle school I mean I was a
 particularly interesting moment that I think it's an interesting moment that Idon't know how to explore correctly
 because we came to this country so I was maybe 13 I don't even remember thosemiddle school and it was a very
 different culture change it was a very very very different culture and we wentto a it was a it's a middle school stuff
 for people in general but I went from having a lot of friends from culturethat I loved somehow deeply is sort of
 this math and science and he talked about this I mean there's so many Frenchdug deep friendships to a very shallow
 place and sort of the difference between whatyou know everybody
 I don't discount the suffering of people but I would say I suffered you know youyou want to be like that's stupid but I
 really psychologically suffered and at the same time you were sort of totallyunable to understand that obviously
 because well hold on a second I think you came to America the the step to cometo America is a beautiful step of
 opportunity so there's this the economy of like to me that was a horrible thingfor my own selfish personal little
 experience I didn't see that I didn't you know at that age you don't thinkabout the big picture of things but it's
 an interesting difference and the step to America is it a really interestingstep because you're sacrificing so much
 of who you are it's a big big leap big leap but it's uhit's the it's a good leap for the future
 of the family for opportunity for for building a life together and it's aninteresting how did you think about that
 process we'll talk about it a little bit it'll take a step back and talk about itmores are big your family but as a dad
 as a family not big but let's just day-to-day how did you that move how didyou experience it how did you think


Speaker 0 :about it well this is a moment and I can
 read for you a poetry unfortunately again it's in Russian but I will use nono it's okay I it's only a couple of
 sentences I will give you from there it's a beautiful very nice very Jewishpoet in 1941 beginning of the war
 so he said catalyst Mirchi dude I used a period eight emotional blockage withsummit rudeness yes by you just I should
 Dania tacky well it's the Thunder fool poem I can read the whole poem later notwith the microphone but listen to that
 you are very nervous before but when it is already attack when you are justalready in action you don't think about
 that so this moment of coming to America thefirst period I was not nervous I was
 like like a machine I was doing I was doing that so yeah I mean it's the same

Speaker 1 :when you decide the decision is the
 right one yeah you see I listen to a

Speaker 0 :three I can just you know it's easy to
 translate it like when you are going to attack you are singing yeah when you cryit's before that you have the stress the


Speaker 1 :anxiety the tears but when you already


Speaker 0 :repair yeah you believe in your star and
 you go and you don't think much

Speaker 1 :well let me pause on this as I asked you
 if you think you were a good father what

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :what you know was I good son yes the


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :better one
 then Greg obviously but no but what what

Speaker 0 :would you know without any hesitation I
 can say that you were and you are very good son because you understand whenyou're talking and it was from the
 beginning he always even if I never kid you're not kids usually they think aboutthemselves and they see the whole world
 is rotating around them but you were way less serious for many years you justused so people around you are able to to
 see okay this is this is my version thesis further I mean II you just seepeople and that's incredible also just
 from the like first months of your life you're laughing smiling yeah and believeme it is not so many kids are doing that
 which means that somewhere deeply in your I don't know where its genesprobably I don't know you were smiling
 so you know like whenever I see it's a good person or not so good person take alook at the personal and this person
 wakes up some people they wake up and the immediate is smile ultimate that'ssomething I don't know it's like a
 miracle so you are okay so thank you for being a good son yeah maybe I'm not sogood father that's another story but


Speaker 1 :well the this context makes it much more
 important for me to criticize you it makes it impossible for you to criticizeme which is exactly how I set it up okay
 but so you mentioned the gossip as one of the people in your storyKirchhoff Institute can you tell the
 story and your involvement in Chernobyl sort of that played a part in our livesas well so what's the story there


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :what is Chernobyl okay for people who


Speaker 0 :don't know yeah Chernobyl it's a it's a
 small city town with a huge nuclear power plant um and it's a place of worldever biggest nuclear severe accident the
 reason of this accident the best if you know Lex but other people they can watchthe movie which is HBO show yeah HBO
 show very good actually I did not expect but it is really verygood oh the major reason is they just
 went through special tests and just testing new regimes and they start todecrease activity of reactor very fast
 and the reactor starts dying and they just increase activity and then theywere unable to stop it
 and temperature go very high metal clothing start reacting with coolingwater producing hydrogen hydrogen reacts
 with oxygen and it was a huge hydrogen explosion the so-called DDT and becauseof this explosion actually a very very
 very very heavy like a tip of the reactor jump up low down andforty tones or something like that I
 froze huge just then destroy the whole reactor and all this nuclear fuel startfalling down create some critical mass
 and it was nuclear explosion but not contained so yes it was what part of the

Speaker 1 :story did the show get right and what
 part of story did you get wrong any of you would be gossips just things you'veexperienced a person so I just very


Speaker 0 :shortly described what happened yes that
 like it was this kind of already nuclear expansion and everything from inside wasboom went out and actually with the wind
 make almost a half circle around the worldso that's accident for instead of atomic
 energy it was a very big deal because the whole community the whole countryactually they consider that this huge
 Institute is responsible for this accident so the reaction don't forgetit's a communist country they decided
 it's like like an army that all people all scientists they are responsible dustmatter whatever if you do in plasma or
 you're doing nuclear reactor does matter you have to go and help you want it youdon't want it you like it you don't like
 it in the movie it was shown but I would say movie is about 97 percent absolutelyright absolutely
 it's unbelievable how good they made this nice they made this movie there

Speaker 1 :from the people the culture the science
 every single interaction the bureaucracy yeah yeah yeah yeah

Speaker 0 :they did not overdo that because it's
 very easy to go like it's a communist country that's why and vice-versa sothey did it the very good harmony is
 very good balance yeah

Speaker 1 :that was perfect were they wrong here at


Speaker 0 :least my impression is that they show
 the apartment of Lagasse's the gossip was actually almost the copy of realdigas visually - yes yes yes yes as this
 actor he looks like legal and just you know Wow just like as a good actoractually it's a good actor British you
 know and that's but it was shown that's like a little bit of already Americanpropaganda they show this leg Asif
 living in like a small apartment like a smoking cigarettes all right no come onit was can you imagine like a vice
 president of Academy of Sciences vice president if he leaves an apartmentcommercially in the Soviet Union where


Speaker 1 :that position means you get you get
 handed given out the apartment he lead

Speaker 0 :no not an apartment it was like a
 special house belonging to him it is like a next door to the Institute itthis house did not belong to him yeah
 but that's where he lived so just he lived like an you know Castle and likethe movie it was what's your memory of


Speaker 1 :him have you know you know madam come on


Speaker 0 :he's my supervisor so like ok so it's
 like a heavy it's like it like Marcia for you yeah like I had like a serif andlike for you it was severe and like
 lagarza for me it's like a motion cam so did have chance to see more should comeyeah is he or laughing it's like the
 other day every day my feeling is he was very good innuclear chemistry he was he was a member
 and very significant member of Communist Party the difference was RoseannaRoseanna was not very much liking
 Communist Party well the gossip he was so he was asecretary of communist party
 organization of crucial Institute for a couple of years so this kind ofpersonality so he was a great scientist
 very interesting very bright but at the same time he was a communist and he kindof believed in this communist ideas and
 he took all that responsibility very close to his heart and that's exactlylike it is shown in the movie especially
 when the director of the Chernobyl station made a incredibly strangemistake because the wrecker was already
 destroyed you remember my explanation but whatthey see the temperature is going up and
 his decision was you know you're an artificial intelligence not so much inphysics and chemistry but if temperature
 is going up what people will do if they are not professionalslet's put water there and he made the
 decision to put an enormous amount of water into the rector to cool it downbut people they took him come on I guess
 we have seen couple of seconds ago there is no reactor there is nothing to cooldown because it's now can we mention
 this huge temperature and you put water into this huge temperature and metalsmetals immediately react with water
 producing hydrogen so actually what they did it's it's it's it's extremely badand it's nicely shown in the movie they
 made the decision for three people to go inside under director and open the valveto let this hot water to let this water
 out and these people they did it obviously it was clear that they weregoing today do you think the accident


Speaker 1 :could have been avoided the Chernobyl


Speaker 0 :accident you know it's so deeply


Speaker 1 :interlinked just Soviet culture they


Speaker 0 :know why no you know how to say is it
 possible to be sure that it will be no fire in the city um it is it's very lowprobability it's a sexual incidence it's
 a couple of stuff with extremely low probability happened at the same timebut it was really important stuff
 Chernobyl happened first of all because it was no automatic system of control itwas impossible if they say already
 accident there is no automatic system to stop it oh why because it's a hugereactor very heavy very very very heavy
 in big way bigger than reactors which we have here in the United States so thisis a more difficult to control so I
 would say it was clear for many people that sooner or later it will be thisaccident and actually it is a copy of
 accident which happened in America and try my Island it's very similar butAmerican accident was more
 better controlled so it was not so huge l still see their excellentwell the gossip he took the stuff very
 close to his heart and and it is very nicely shown in themovie and actually that's why he suicide


Speaker 1 :he took his own life here yeah and by


Speaker 0 :the way he tried twice first time not
 successful a second one so there's a

Speaker 1 :there's a journey of suffering there
 afterwards he he he took you know he were the burden of credit for that the

Speaker 0 :responsibility and yes because actually
 he was claiming that these reactors are the safest in the world yeah and theyare but the they're way more resistive
 to small accidents right but they have this tiny chance of severe accident evennow a lot of these records are still the


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :same are still the same and still around


Speaker 1 :okay let's get into the fun can you tell
 me what is plasma the simple explanation

Speaker 0 :would be like the plasma it is what we
 have in fluorescent lamps if you look around in your own it is something youhave in all kind of sources like a most
 of monitors TV screens etc significant number of them let's plays most plasmaplasma is ionized gas what does it mean
 like we have gas around us and let's say with electric field electrons areseparated from ions so yes you take
 electron out of molecule so molecule becomes positive ion and electron isseparate with an iron iron it's if you
 take if take an atom or molecule and take one electron outwould stay there so iron it is like a
 atom or molecule after the saraburi when they lost an electron and what's

Speaker 1 :interesting about anion okay very second


Speaker 0 :probably going to apply electric field
 whoever is lighter take energy immediately energized very fast so I insthey stay regularly usually they stay
 cold because they are heavy they are not very much moving so they are stay coldwhile electrons are energized almost
 immediately yeah and their temperature in most of plasmas whatever you doelectron temperature is usually on
 ballpark it's about ten fifteen thousand Kelvin or Celsius which means twentythirty thousand Fahrenheit hot so
 electrons are very very very very very hot and ions like gas they're usually inmost cases they're cold so if I take
 like a cell phone and touch the screen well inside you have where you oftenhave electrons with the temperature 20
 30,000 Fahrenheit but you cannot feel it why because it's a one electron permillion of molecules it's not so many of
 them it's like let's say Syria Philadelphia do we have billionaires inthe city of Philadelphia maybe 100 but
 it's but it's not so much easy to meet them on the street because it's only oneor two for a huge city so the same story
 here so plasma it is very energized electrons and usually relatively coldgas but these electrons they can do a
 lot like these billionaires in Philadelphia few have like a couple ofthese billionaires they can do a lot
 it's only two of them but actually they can influence life in the city more thanair itself
 because they have abilities the same story there so electrons depending ongas they are able to create very active
 species so they can be used as a source of light like a fluorescent lamps andthey can be used to three different
 materials so most of synthetic well I would say 100% of synthetic materialsthey are treated before coloring because
 like you have a nice black tie but how to make tag black if it is synthetic ifit is natural is solid real but if it is
 synthetic material and if you try you know paint synthetic material you knowpain does not stick to it
 so you plasma treat it this electron will activate the surface and colorsthey start sticking to the surface what


Speaker 1 :is me to activate a surface so there's a
 lot of plasma is interacting somehow of the surface well this human skin yeahsome kind of surface so what does it
 mean to treat a surface okay try it

Speaker 0 :station but it's you know if you have
 polymer like in the case of your tie if I would like a polymer what what thiselectron does is just create or H and
 this 4-h take hydrogen out of your tie and this is a opening bond and usuallyoxygen stick to there and become polar
 so you cover the surface with the polar groups which are always sticky so that'swhat is going on you just take one atom
 out you have free bound oxygen there polar groups here stick you can paint ifif you put a droplet droplets of whiskey
 on the suffer of glass it will stay like a droplets but if you just plasma treatthis glass and then you put drop the
 drop leg loops immediately cover very significant area okay so let's let's

Speaker 1 :step back a little bit
 so there's solid liquid gas he said yeah it's ionized gas why is plasma sometimescalled the fourth state of matter so
 what's the difference between gas and ionized gas mm-hmm such that it's afundamental difference it is a


Speaker 0 :fundamental difference because like what
 is going on that this ionized gas immediately has very different behaviorthe world plasma was actually created
 just because of similarity with blood plasma so like you asked the differencebetween plasma and gas it is about the
 same difference like difference between water and bloodso species inside a blood they're very
 much interacting with each other while water they're not much interacting sowhy here wing length mirror in 1930 436
 he started using the word plasma versus ionized gas because he said take a looktake a look take a look this species
 they interact with each other and

Speaker 1 :another so there's there's echoes
 connections to inspiration from blood plasma yes and the degrees of theinteractivity more than that so the the


Speaker 0 :guy who just Nobel Prize laureate
 earring lender was at first for analyzed by the interaction plasma search on thesurface so you can say that he's like a
 father of modern electronics hardware so he come up with this world take a lookthis plasma is kind of funny it looks
 like a blood plasma and people they start like using this phrase like a jokethen you know like it was really like it
 stuck oh that's really interesting okay

Speaker 1 :so you said electrons really hot so
 so traditionally plasma is supposed to be very high-energy very hotmm-hmm so he said train its electrons


Speaker 0 :but there's a hot plasma and cold plasma
 so we'll 244 okay in hot plasma everything is hot so if you have moreelectrons and they are able to heat up
 the whole gas it's a hot plasma like solar plasma the Sun or Sun solar plasmaSun uh
 and in this case temperature is very high fusion plasmas so just everythingis very hot in most of engineering
 plasmas today including your cell phones including fluorescent lamps etceteraetcetera or in these case only electrons
 are there huts and they are unable to heat up everybody it's like this coupleof billionaires in the city of
 middle-class people and but these electrons there if it is air for examplethey just electrons they react with
 oxygen making atomic oxygen atomic oxygen immediately produce ozone soatomic oxygen sticks - OH - creating OHS
 oh by the way ozone means I think in Latin means smellso the name of the guy who first saw
 that it was Siemens if you remember company Siemens so that's the creator ofthis company because he was the first
 one to understand this ozone and said wow it smellsthen he they use like a legend or third
 word for that it was on and they start using ozone for water cleaning right so

Speaker 1 :what's hot plasma and what's cold plasma
 she said in the cold plasma the electrons like the billionaire's is theonly thing that stays hot so what


Speaker 0 :hospital asthma everybody be on earth
 and so in terms of applications in terms

Speaker 1 :of the theoretical physics under
 underpinning what's the difference between hot plasma and cold plasma

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :there's entire groups of researchers


Speaker 0 :that work on that yes yes you know the
 fundamental difference is when everything is 10,000 degrees what we cando with this material with this plasma
 it's like everything is ten thousand like a ten thousand Kelvin like a twentythousand Fahrenheit what you can do I
 mean that stuff melts everything and convert everything into vapor when soscientifically it's very easier because
 it's like as close to thermodynamic equilibrium so just very very very hotsubstance one is hella many applications
 applications the major application is if you wanna melt something which requiretemperature above yeah 2,000 Celsius


Speaker 1 :which is what the Isis torches so if you
 want if you want a hot metal metal you

Speaker 0 :can actually you can cut metal with most
 of metals they are just you know they melt it on the level of below 2000 sofor these metals with some exceptions
 but for these metals fire you know combustion torches thereokay now if you want to melt something
 which is impossible to melt like a special hard ceramicsif you cannot melt it with anything
 first of all why do you need it why do you need melt something which isimpossible to Makaha if you let's say if
 you want to protect your airplane your airplane it's a good idea to coverairplane with a thin layer of a
 substance which is impossible to to melt which is not afraid of anything notafraid of lightning not afraid of
 anything how to do that you have to melt we have to cover it with this materialbut to cover we have to melt it now how
 to melt something which is impossible to weldwell you have to take plasma so plasma
 goes hot flash thermal plasma goes to this huge temperature then you put thispowder you melt it and you spray
 what's thermal plasma that's the heart

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :kind of that's a high temperature plasma


Speaker 1 :okay so what's cold plasma then and what
 kind of temperatures are we talking about what's this world in terms ofapplications and theory thence now
 fundamentally different from the heart a

Speaker 0 :kind cold plasma it is even it's it's
 situation when you have electrons only electrons are hot and they generate alot of active species radicals atoms so
 they can treat different materials they can make very sophisticated structuresbut temperature is low so you do not
 damage so let's say jumping for special intelligence if you are talking aboutcomputer how to make computer how to
 make this wafers how to make these chips yeah you have to be able to dig tinytiny tiny tiny tiny ditches how to do
 that you have to have you cannot use mechanical devices so you have to havesomething different beams lasers no
 because laser is heating its temperature but you cannot take if you just uselaser you go to temperature eternal
 thousand degrees you will damage phone cannot withstand this temperatureyes the same computer so that's why
 there is no alternative today only cold plasma to make I would say vast majorityof electronics devices so hardware it's
 almost you say hardware it is that so

Speaker 1 :let me beautifully put
 what's now you said application we'll talk about some applications includingplasma medicine but from a if we if you
 put on your theoretical physicist or chemist like fundamental science higherwhat are the interesting problems in
 plasma mysteries they're not yet understood or things that have beenrecently understood I've seen you talk
 about incredible applications but let's step let's not cover that first is theresome open problems
 how was it understood from a theoretical perspective I can give you a couple of

Speaker 0 :examples it's a lot of mysteries a lot
 why because it is strongly non equilibrium medium almost every cellswhich we have around us it's an
 equilibrium what what does I mean what

Speaker 1 :does it mean for a medium to be an
 equilibrium equilibrium means it has

Speaker 0 :temperature has temperature yeah some


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :temperature like this is let say room
 temperature well no I mean what you mean

Speaker 1 :by that is there's a uniformity to it


Speaker 0 :uniformity in temperature not space
 uniformity but homogeneity like it's near if temperature now can you imaginesomething which has a couple of
 different temperatures at the same point as it possible yeah that's what it is soelectrons are very hot but they are
 inside of gas and gas is cold like like people they are swimming in the ocean sotemperature of a person is higher but
 here just temperatures way way way here now what starts happening in this caseit's a lot of
 finding miracles a lot of funny miracles for example electron impact createsexcitation of molecules to molecule a
 stylus oscillate and people will learn that distribution this becomes verystrange energy rich molecules they they
 take more energy when they have already something and okay rich people theybecome richer and poor people then
 becomes more poor exactly the same thing they call it capitalism in molecularlife happens in plasma so what is going
 on you take molecules in plasma excite andvery fast against all the rules of
 whatever nature couple of molecules they have to quantum and they have more andmore and more and more than normal and
 very soon make some molecules they have everything and most of molecules havenothing as a result if you have this
 kind of non equilibrium immediately creates lasers so this is one of thereason why lasers first offers lasers
 they were created in plasma even now the most energetic like co2 laser exceptplasma lasers and there's also plasma
 laser plasma it's very accelerated application but physics is here I canexplain it's a little bit longer how it
 works but it's very similar to what is going on with people if you already havemoney it's easier for you to attract new
 money if you are actually poor sooner or later you will lose your money in thefavour of rich people not sure how well


Speaker 1 :the analogy works but probably but
 they're saying that there's some fascinating complicated instabilityabout that hole but it's interesting


Speaker 0 :it's interesting instability its
 instability not space instability its energy instability hereit's like a yes you said capitalism


Speaker 1 :capitalism at the molecular level


Speaker 0 :it's a capitalism it's a like a wild
 capitalism yeah where just everything works against the middle class who's the

Speaker 1 :Bernie Sanders in this physics analogy
 I'm just kidding that's a who's the

Speaker 0 :social oh okay and I don't know let's


Speaker 1 :not take this analogy that's interesting


Speaker 0 :that you know that plasma works works
 against Bernie Sanders so nature nature

Speaker 1 :yeah nature's as a is a more Republican


Speaker 0 :it's a more of a public nature is


Speaker 1 :Republican well no not nature at in


Speaker 0 :plasma Nanakuli it's only non
 equilibrium class non-equilibrium plasma

Speaker 1 :equilibrium plasma it's everything it's


Speaker 0 :very much Bernie Sanders it's very much
 harness distribution

Speaker 1 :yeah well non equilibrium plasmas let's


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :live a short life and die quickly so yes
 so if you want a long peaceful existence you want to go that's one of the reasons

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :why will these Bernie Sanders in visit


Speaker 0 :that's very interesting that but for
 this reason non-equilibrium plasma cold plasma is able to produce way moremiracles as miracles meaning very


Speaker 1 :interesting strange errand rapturous


Speaker 0 :patterns treatment like you cannot use
 hot plasma to make electronic device well you can do it it's just one exampleanother example is like a recently I
 came yesterday well yeah yesterday from Japan so we presented ionization ofliquids not gases so it's a lot of
 interesting new stuff Oh liquids very

Speaker 1 :interesting yeah so you've mentioned
 physics in chemistry what is plasma physics what is plasma chemistry interms of application in terms of theory
 what are the different lenses of physics and chemistry that you used to exploreplasma and how do they differ you have
 books on each yes

Speaker 0 :the simplest I think that it was fine
 one who was asked what is physics and I think it's himand after some thinking he said well
 that's what physicists do yeah so that's a good point so actually it's a nice way

Speaker 1 :to say that's a stupid question but it
 gives the question of more of a chance so what's the difference between plasma

Speaker 0 :physics does McGuinness in even physics


Speaker 1 :and chemistry more broadly and can I
 mean I don't know what's the more easier

Speaker 0 :distinction to draw yeah I can compare
 with languages like what's the difference between English language andChinese language in one case you have
 how many I forgot 23 or whatever characters how many well yeah it was

Speaker 1 :five okay something-something twenties


Speaker 0 :yeah and in Japanese Oh in the Chinese
 you have ten thousand forty thousand characters so Chinese it's chemistryEnglish it's physics physics has small
 number of rules and laws of nature and operates with that so understandinglet's say how to ionize gas it's physics
 understanding how to create plasma in liquid it's physics understanding how tomake a device how to make a light source
 plasma light source it's physics now when we are coming to Chinese I'll Imean to this chemistry it means that
 there is a million different tables not

Speaker 1 :rules tables yes it's tables instead of


Speaker 0 :rules and so what's not going on you
 just look at that and see oh my gosh this glass my special anotherequilibrium plasma creates thousands of
 species and we have to understand what kind of species and sometimes you needthese species but you don't need these
 species so how to have more of that and I would have less of thesethere is no rules well there are some
 rules but about as much as in create creating Chinese characters so a lot of

Speaker 1 :it is a lot of the knowledge in plasma
 chemistry is discovered through experimentation yeah and I would say

Speaker 0 :chemistry is more art physics is a
 little bit more science like linguistics you know English language it's possiblethat's also a lot of challenges but it's
 simple well talking about simple and

Speaker 1 :complicated going from physics to
 chemistry let's go to biology one of the exciting feels that you're one of thefounders of his plasma medicine what is
 plasma medicine ok cold plasma cold

Speaker 0 :plasma creates a lot of species
 interesting species unexpected species you remember this capitalism inmolecular life you can a little bit
 change parameters and it can be wrong look I start generating this strangesubstance it's a twisted so plasma is
 very sensitive the difference is like a human body and asthma generates veryinteresting active species actually to
 be honest almost exactly the same so professor David graves he keeps sayingthat he was impressed and he looked you
 know books of medical biology books and he said like a species active speciesinside of human body and in Copeland's
 they're the same so plasma create is very interesting stuff and it was clearfor people from the beginning like
 already for more than hundred years that if you put plasma in contact with humanbody
 you can treat some diseases you can do a lot of stuff the problem was that ifplasma is energetic and you put this
 energetic plasma in contact with human body you kill the person so actually thewhole point the whole interesting point
 of plasma medicine so plasma medicine came from physicists actually where itbecome possible to make uniform not
 damaging very energetic plasmas example at atmospheric pressure example we haveatmospheric pressure around atmosphere
 and there is a lightning lightning is hot and very energetic and very damagingplasma sources plasma discharges like
 lightning it's impossible to use to treat human body you'll just throw a lot

Speaker 1 :of this fry fry do you kill the


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :competition yeah now what happened like
 when 16 years ago it was the first time when physicists tolearn how to make lightning not like
 concentrated in a tiny channel to be diffused and just around a big big bigbig area like to make it something like
 a aurora borealis from lightning and it was actually in 1990s a lot of likeefforts it was a French approach they
 just etc but finally we won because what we it was like a out-of-the-box solutionto make extremely short electric paths


Speaker 1 :short especially or temporarily in time
 time in time so let's say because we

Speaker 0 :have when we have lightning between
 clouds and ground it's like a continuous voltage but if weapply this voltage between skies and
 ground let's say couple of nanoseconds there is no time to create the LightningChannel
 just simply no time so what is going on you start creating something like auroraborealis so you have a glowing
 everywhere because there is no time to create a channel so you make this pulseand then you stop yes and then you
 repeat this pulse again then you stop and you repeat this pulse againso through this not a second passing it
 impossible to create a uniform class and if plasma is uniform it's not damagingaurora borealis you will not kill
 anybody with lightning you will so that

Speaker 1 :allows you not damaging to now start
 allowing plasma to interact with the human body somehow so treating tissuesfor example yes why is that interesting
 what yeah what kind of applications are

Speaker 0 :we talking about okay today the biggest
 application is related to treatment of chronic wounds like our sourceespecially diabetic ulcers also recently
 treatment of cancers because our plasma sources are permitted to be used duringsurgeries so when like a surgeon is
 making surgery he removes cancer but some margins are not treated so theystart using this plasma just to remove
 tissue bad tissue without damage because it is instead of like a scalpel it'slike a jet small jet for wounds it's a
 very effective generation of the stimulation of angiogenesis so justdrawing all blood vessels
 so that's I would say two most successful applications today what

Speaker 1 :plasma related Nobel Prizes do you think
 will be given in the next 50 years so if you look at at the big ideas in plasmawhat do you think is there to be
 discovered understood or may have already been understood and and will be

Speaker 0 :recognized for it okay
 closer to our field at least where we are playing and if we are fielders our Iwould say cold plasma for magical
 biological applications I would say if there is a significant actually acceptedby FDA etc success and treatment of
 cancer there is a big chance to get Nobel Prize what discipline would you

Speaker 1 :get it will be medicine in medicine


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :that's fascinating


Speaker 0 :that's fascinating it is this another
 example which I like a lot personally it is this plasma ionization of liquidswithout bubbles that's the chance so to
 get Nobel Prize for that because its first of all it's a fascinating physics

Speaker 1 :ionization of liquids are bubbles what's
 the niche of the bubbles that form if

Speaker 0 :you take liquid and put like a two
 electrodes in the liquid to ionize liquids you need a huge electric fieldat least that's what most people they
 used to think because mean free path is small so electrons they they have to beaccelerated to have this huge energy so
 it's either electric field is huge or there is enough distance just routeto accelerate now if you have liquid
 that's no much place to to go so you have to have about a thousand timesgreater electric field or you have to
 create some voids if you create voids and send of liquor that's okaynow that's what people that you still
 believe but maybe about five seven years ago people they understood that evenwhen they have very high electric bill
 but not a huge and they start having ionization of liquid so just the same asplasma in fluorescent lamps but you have
 the same thing in liquid and first one's very interesting physics is a longerstory to explain that's very interesting
 physics but also that interest application because you have possibilityto have cold plasma inside of liquid so
 you can synthesize new materials you can do something so that was the reason likeI came a couple of yesterday making this
 presentation of these discharges and creation of this in the initial creationof polymeric nitrogen because people
 they don't have nitrogen polymers today and that's in cold plasma it wassynthesized so it is very interesting
 from fundamental point of view of synthetic chemistry but nobody were ableto make like this kind of change from
 nitrogen right so that was created it's very interesting now this material atnormal conditions is converted back to
 regular nitrogen releasing huge energy way more than any explosive materials so

Speaker 1 :okay so those are two interesting ideas
 yeah close close to your heart what about what about the Sun what about hotthermal plasma do you think there's an
 interesting open problems there that will help us understand the universe orsomething like that I don't think so


Speaker 0 :today there is no I think for for
 thermal plasma there is very low chances for Nobel Prize kind of results howeverthere is a so called fusion plasmas so
 plasmas because the thermal plasma which we discuss it's it's thermal engineeringplasmas it's
 it's plasmas like melting welding these kind of applications coatings andsurface of the Sun surface of the Sun
 but if you go to higher temperatures you have fuel nuclear fusion but if innormal plasma thermal plasma temperature
 is about ten thousand Kelvin ten thousand for fusion you have to have 100million so it's more Wow so inside the


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :Sun it's a deeply inside and the physics


Speaker 1 :there is interesting


Speaker 0 :physics is extremely interesting because
 it's a lot of questions with stability and this plasma this kind of temperatureyou behave very different so it is it is
 I would say super fluidic material so it's just it's it's do you think there's

Speaker 1 :possible breakthroughs in terms of using
 fusion as an energy source or somehow in you know that kind of like a crazy ideaswere out there ideas but on this podcast
 I talk to people about aliens and traveling across the universal if youwant to travel across the universe
 you're gonna have to write healing is

Speaker 0 :that my feeling is that like a fusion
 plasma in its traditional way which was started in my Sahara in 1953 almost nochances well I mean they have it they
 have it already but the system is so complicatedthis tokamaks this big eater become
 tokamak is so complicated so difficult that personally it's difficult for me tobelieve that it will be like a real
 energy generating plant so this is being

Speaker 1 :up to control fusion in order to
 leverage if yeah hey just say try

Speaker 0 :already for how many years of oxygen
 that's an interesting point that's what I'm trying to saylet I am almost sure that at some point
 hopefully soon it will be young I'm not very much young but usually youngout-of-the-box thinking person who will
 say guys take a look I did it

Speaker 1 :something like envision some Thai
 confusion you know there's a lot of guys and girls like that who are called crazywho've been talking about cold fusion
 for decades yeah so you think you hope that there isa breakthrough idea that my lease yes


Speaker 0 :hey I'm almost sure about that and I
 can't explain you simple physics if it's forty seconds thirty side it one

Speaker 1 :and take longer put okay don't try me
 take a look take a look what is fusion

Speaker 0 :you take the etherium three two or the
 state of the cerium you bring them together and they fuse and you theyrelease energy that's it right the
 problem is that this is iron this design they're positively charged and we haveto bring them extremely close and energy
 required for that is 10 10 100 million degrees that's what they try to do nownow take a look why we have to bring
 them so much close we can bring them a little bit and it will be tunneling sothey will start tracking it require more
 time yes but that's okay but to do that you have to have three smaller sizes youhave to have dense matter maybe 30 40 50
 times denser than what we have now how to do that you have to replace electronby something very similar to electron
 but heavier ions if you do that immediately substance becomes smallerand you start having cold normal fusion
 but like a production and reproduction of this material it's kind ofcomplicated people there try what I'm
 trying to say that somebody will come up with an interesting outthe box solution that's what I believe
 well you're right a lot of people they're a little bit I would say notprofessionally just think oh look I did
 it but but between these people or between serious scientists thinking outof the box
 Samson will happen tokamaks yes they work but there's so much complicatedit's very difficult to keep 100 million
 degrees for isn't a long time just very difficult beautiful unless whatever willdo that Nobel Prize without any question
 okay the way okay refill refill you soon baby shoes never do it okay we talked

Speaker 1 :about coming to here's to you okay doing
 good three hours in we talked about the journey to America a little bit butlet's take a step back it seems like an
 unlikely journey that has to do with a bunch of different factors ideas hopesand dreams and goals and plans why did
 we move to America as a family can you tell the story there narrowly andbroadly as our big family that's a lot


Speaker 0 :of details out of like a interesting
 stuff which happened at the same time together first of all I was already inFrance most of time which made situation
 easier to go to America but absolutely significant role was played by captain'sfamily what is the Caplan's family yeah


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :it is our last name is Friedman yes


Speaker 1 :taking attention yeah what's good Kaplan


Speaker 0 :it's a it's the name of
 four of your grand grandmother yours my grandmother my great grandmother your

Speaker 1 :great-grandmother


Speaker 0 :so her name was Kelly rich and when her
 family came in America they changed name to Kaplan's and it was forbidden tocontact family during an early period


Speaker 1 :you need to reach outside the country
 Soviet Union to which so there's this big family well not that I'm not big butnow big Kaplan family they came to yes


Speaker 0 :yeah and my father he your grandfather
 had this interesting picture and without much hopes he wrote a letter withoutspeaking English and you saw this
 everywhere it is said like a Jew newspaper and the word Jew was G spot on

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :g g e-- w yeah newspapers Cincinnati lit
 it America and we got to his destination

Speaker 1 :and that's like a miracle


Speaker 0 :yeah that the letter came to this
 direction it's interesting because the

Speaker 1 :newspaper published the letter yeah
 that's uh it's it's kind of America and that yeah it's a it's a miracleso that's started the miracle they gave
 a catalyst that was a catalyst yeah it

Speaker 0 :was an action and just as a result you
 know we met and just an it was a catalyst for me to accept the positionalready for friends position of a full
 professor in University of Illinois and Chicago and that's actually how we movedto Chicago so did you ever think that


Speaker 1 :you would come to America honestly no


Speaker 0 :even with my good friends we were
 usually talking and my plans when I understand that it's better for ascientist to go like outside of South
 Soviet Union

Speaker 1 :Europe Daniel dos tres and my choice was


Speaker 0 :clearly friends and we usually say that
 I spoke with Boris Potemkin that I always say that I will go to FranceI said well and I want to go to South
 America Oh but actually heaven all the wayopposites oh yes okay


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :I spoke way better French language yeah


Speaker 1 :and I started a new French taking French


Speaker 0 :that there was there was a there was an


Speaker 1 :alternate reality where we moved to
 France and I'm French yeah and you're French and chances for

Speaker 0 :death were very high fifty-fifty kind of


Speaker 1 :thing I mean I remember there being is
 pretty certain that we're going to France

Speaker 0 :yeah it was more than 50% yeah because
 we have already I mean it was very very high chance yeah you remember thepicture I show you over there with me or
 with French people without been shooting off ski few no remember I just foreverremember like I'll mention I have ski he
 loves you he useful oh he's a lobbyist yeah yeah and he plays very nice pianoyeah it's a very very nice people and
 there's a different world of scientists

Speaker 1 :a different perhaps more pure in their
 pursuit of science a more support for the kind of labs and the spirit of thescientific process it's uh America's
 academic research system is a little bit more capitalistic I guess an American

Speaker 0 :professor spends about 50 percent of
 time looking for funding and they're a

Speaker 1 :little bit more independent meaning
 their own little startup more it's very difficult to do an institute and so onspeaking of which I don't know how I
 forgot to mention but the Institute you're you've headed the Drexel than Iam plasma Institute for a long time from


Speaker 0 :2002 from 2002 what was that journey


Speaker 1 :like of all the many brilliant people
 that have worked there through the years all the different ideashaving an institute in America is an
 interesting thing in itself yes all the other what's that journey been like wow

Speaker 0 :it was very exciting and very
 challenging and I would say that I work very hard but I would say I was verymuch lucky that I was able to bring who
 is me a nice group of people with Nestor good Sal poor chef and more recentlyordinary chant and then he'll the bring
 in a lot now and in others so it was a

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :lot of people and they were good and it
 was a very nice feeling of how to say camaraderie camaraderie yeah in a living

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :including Greg who made a huge
 contribution to that Norma's so it is like it's my brother yep and I've been

Speaker 1 :on the outside of that sort of looking
 in so I know a lot of these people they're good and either stick or they'realmost like a part of family I know
 they're part of our story in America really yeah I know the yeah and we have

Speaker 0 :a handsome and to remember of my time
 plus miniseries yeah yeah yeah low head don't be shy no no no fear no fear yeahdon't be shy go head NPI and P I'd you


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :write that yeah you know eighth grade


Speaker 1 :your poetry has been going down downhill
 and me we talked about that a lot that writing poetry English like she's muchmore difficult it's it's a and hence why
 it's not as popular it's it's not more popular gifts through in music throughhip hop through rap that's the popular
 kind of poetic writing is in America

Speaker 0 :basically in France it is very closer to
 Russia the French language allows uh

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :yeah French language allows for at least
 like song oriented poetry what would you say

Speaker 1 :is the difference between the Soviet
 Union in America that kind of maybe to ask it another way what do you missabout the Soviet Union about Russia


Speaker 0 :about Ukraine you see that while me and
 other people which came in our generation which came from RussiaUkraine Soviet Union we just we were not
 happy absolutely not happy with the political system over there but I wouldsay without an exception we are all I
 would say deeply in love with Russian culture which is absolutely unique andabsolutely beautiful and my and my
 feeling that while I like American culture also but a rationalist waycloser to my heart and I think it's way
 richer the same thing is approach to science which in Russia was very let'sfirst of all I like it because I was
 younger which is always nice to be young but you know this kind of feeling ofscience is more important than
 everything else and being a professor it is the most prestigious professionthat's kind of interesting culture but
 but the political system was not good and nice now it's also challenging but

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :what do you think about Putin
 with my Boonton insurgent of Putin came

Speaker 1 :to power after we left yeah


Speaker 0 :to sound here mm exactly you remember
 this moment when we were in Miami Beach New Year's New Year it was exactly theday when putting the came a president
 because absolutely unexpectedly one day before that it was like a New Yeargreeting from a president at that time
 Boris Yeltsin and he said happy holidays Happy New Year guys andyou know what I decided to step down
 oops and just I wanna another person to leadthe country different transition periods
 and then we have elections so that's day

Speaker 1 :so we talk and I in different ways also
 love certain parts of Russia and there's still a part of me even though it's Ididn't spend there more than 13 years or
 whatever but Putin represents modern Russia sothat's why I asked if it's you know
 we're we're Americans now really but what do you think about this man who'scaring who's defining the 21st century


Speaker 0 :Russia I would say there is a to phrases
 to sayings which come into my mind you see you gave me 10 seconds to thinkwhich is important there is a saying the
 end justifies the means you know who said that it's a there is a book hereit's a it's a Machiavelli oh this is by
 the way his sculpture well so the the

Speaker 1 :head yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I know but


Speaker 0 :straight
 I said Machiavelli in the book prince he said that the ends justifies dreamsanother phrase it's another nice guy
 maximilien robespierre he used to say you cannot make an omelet withoutbreaking eggs
 on a papaya they have them let the Sun Casa deserve yeah that's a Robespierreand these two phrases actually they
 describe for me at least Putin you know that his way of thinking is it was ahuge jerk catastrophe because think for
 a second huge Soviet Union were Russians they were everywhere- people Russian Russian and in during a
 short period of time boons it is a 15 independent countrieswhat the hell and and like significant I
 don't know I would say almost half okay a lesson help but very significantnumber of Russians they become like his
 people living in other countries not very much friendly to Russia so he putall his efforts to change it to to make
 it easier and better that and this is the ends which justifies means and he isbreaking a lot of eggs and he's making a
 lot of not good steps but for the good purpose now just what I keep thinkingthat Russian Empire it is a not first
 Empire to disappear now take a look what happened to other empires French Empireoh my gosh they had enormous lis
 problems very similar to Putin and you know who was there Putin it was the goalbecause in late 1950s it was an enormous
 war in Algeria and the whole group of Maghreb countries and you know whathappened they just even stopped the
 Republic and they create absolutely new constitution and it was actuallyabsolute disaster in late 1950s early
 1960s but they actually went out faster than Russiawell why it's a different story now take
 a look another huge the biggest empire in the world it's a British they losttheir empire and huge number of British
 people they just stay somewhere the same thing like Soviet Union but interestingenough they they they made it they made
 like this other countries which get rid of British Empire but they were still inlove with the Queen they become part of
 this Commonwealth and it was relatively smooth so British they did excellent jobFrench hmm like always you know yeah
 yeah tariffs but Russia so far doing not good so they are just they they try tohelp they try to make this kind of but
 they break a lot of eggs should I

Speaker 1 :interview Putin on his podcast piece is


Speaker 0 :a very interesting personality he's very
 smart and try but sure but what you want to talk about because power future of

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :Russia future of Russia and is great and


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :it's right no no no not not doing not in
 those kinds of questions but in the kind of omelet and eggs wayand
 in the space of technology sort of

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :innovation of science of becoming a
 superpower again which is where you have to you know the space race he will like

Speaker 0 :this kind of discussion because what I
 know about him by the way he supports the platform Edison little asthmamedicine yes because when he defined
 like a three or whatever four major directions of development of science hementioned those are the three owners and
 plasma medicine yeah okay interesting he really thinks that the ends justifiesthe means
 so he is not afraid to make any kind of decision but to make country strongerand and he did actually he did a very
 good job from the word review of you know all other republics they weresaying that I have all our problems is
 because of freshmen but what Russia can say if all these problems because ofyeah he took responsibility but with


Speaker 1 :power authoritarians power can is very
 useful but it can also cloud your judgment you can slowly become a lesserman that you could have otherwise been
 without being checked so doing the complicated instantaneous it's a

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :complicated interesting story so you can


Speaker 0 :compare him with maximilien robespierre
 so without a microphone between us we

Speaker 1 :often talk about artificial intelligence
 you have a lot of opinions like you said you're always think you're right andyou're right you know yeah barely half
 of the time no I'm right absolutely

Speaker 0 :always it was exceptional of cases yeah
 when I'm wrong wrong which never happens

Speaker 1 :yes it hasn't been observed ok so let me
 get your profound deep opinions about artificial intelligence do you thinkwe'll ever build systems that are as
 intelligent or more intelligent than human beings in the same kind of waythat we think humans are intelligent you


Speaker 0 :know the most important is the last
 remark which you made I strongly believe in their official intelligence I believethat it will be a lot of development in
 the direction of like a human similarity to human but I've very much doubt aboutartificial consciousness this kind of
 stuff from my point of view it's very questionable so I don't know what is

Speaker 1 :consciousness to you consciousness it's


Speaker 0 :it's way more it's a wider stuff it's
 like a wow it's complex of feelings it's a complex of feelings likeintelligence its smartness it's a
 knowledge it's a disability to operate with knowledge consciousness it's itsknowledge but way much together with
 feelings do you think science will ever

Speaker 1 :be able to understand consciousness so


Speaker 0 :here I believe I believe that sooner or
 later at least in this direction will be big breakthroughs so do you think do you

Speaker 1 :think could be able to put consciousness
 inside a Roomba inside a phone inside a camera devices consciousness

Speaker 0 :consciousness I don't know you know like
 a Jewish answer to most of the questions I mean we don't know yes we don't know Imean I it's very difficult to predict
 what will happen with science and 300 years it's like to ask 300 years ago inwhat in 19 in 1700 come on it's way
 before Napoleon yeah the in every years of last year'sof Luke at all
 whatever the Dalek for teens and you ask them about cell phones what do what doif you ask Li cateura if you ask him a
 question what he thinks about cell phones he will say this we call a I am aSun King uh-huh that's it


Speaker 1 :no you're simplifying because perhaps
 the perhaps perhaps but because it is another words cellphone but if I askedknow about artificial intelligence then
 explained it correctly he would actually have an opinionalready they've had opinions about these
 kinds of things but yeah yeah sort of can man this is a fundamentalphilosophical question can human beings
 create artificial versions of themselves with Frankenstein other than me peoplehave been thinking when you bring out a
 build of statues it's a and and people have been maybe not Jews but people havebeen confidently providing answers okay


Speaker 0 :what I can tell you my feeling yes
 artificial person will be created okay so the way it is yeah how close it willbe like a this like a synthetic
 synthetic person will be with respect to reality yeah is it good or bad it's justdifferent great but it is doable so we


Speaker 1 :have this disagreement a lot and you
 think that so do you think such a system needs to have a body and ourdisagreement is often about the senses
 you say to have a full reading experience of consciousness you smelltouch so and I say you can do just words


Speaker 0 :words and the image not even just words


Speaker 1 :but yes image is helpful but words even
 just the award's voice okay you know

Speaker 0 :like don't forget I lived many years in
 France so for me smell like a Armagnac I mean smell is very much often moreimportant than taste
 yeah but image can be even less important so just taste and smell sowhat I'm trying to say that I mean but
 that wait wait if I give you an option I

Speaker 1 :had to kill all your senses except one
 which one would you like to stay with I

Speaker 0 :would not you know that's not it's like
 a good question it's like a question you know if you have a choice to kill yourfather or mother what do you would do I
 mean it's not the father well yeah what I'm trying to say thatit's my feeling it's more holistic that
 people they can lose one of feelings it's okaybut yeah that's true and yes that's not


Speaker 1 :life but you think it's it's actually


Speaker 0 :it's a bouquet including like you said


Speaker 1 :cautiousness is a bouquet I like it but
 you think a system should have a sense of smell sense of touch and my feeling

Speaker 0 :is that it's not so difficult to do yes


Speaker 1 :from so this is where we have
 disagreements and debates and software or says hardware I mean you're much morecomfortable with hardware and and taste
 and smell these are kinds of things that it's it's almost like a sensor it's achemistry problem yeah but it with me


Speaker 0 :actually I am from harmony I'm not
 saying this is hardware this software yeah I would say that that's a it's notthe bouquet in this case it's it's a
 harmony I mean yeah no I guess I come

Speaker 1 :from a world it's a very kind of AI
 world in computer science world where you think that most of the problems inthe world can be converted into a 99%
 software problem and that's that's the dream because it's easier than but but

Speaker 0 :do you know it was a Russian comedian
 absolutely beautiful shiny etske maybe you remember he might be nervoushe used to say in Russian the way it is
 put it of Russia of streets is hypocritical Tony which is nothingprobable what does it mean well how to
 forget me translate it into English hmm let's now don't even try it's fine Ehsan

Speaker 1 :it's fine but what I'm trying to say


Speaker 0 :that this this is a poet is is it
 possible to describe with words tastes of oysters if you never ever try themand that's very important moment
 sometimes this big data their official intelligence they say ok we don't needsmell we can describe what has been
 described as smell it means that they can collect data about like a smell ofcheese and put it in like a huge
 database and based on that to help you to choose what is the best chase withoutsmelling so this in this case I have to
 recommend to this computer or to this computer scientists to think about thenetsuke
 and this argument about taste of oysters without trying them at least once intheir life ok that's why I think that
 taste is important smell should be also encoded yeah I disagree because I think

Speaker 1 :it is that so I agree that's very
 important but I believe our mind and artificial minds will be able to fill inthe gaps so without being able to smell
 you you start without ever having tasted or smelled oysters you start imaginingsmell on taste it won't be connected to
 reality at all but you construct a world that's consistent so I would say in this

Speaker 0 :case it's not artificial intelligence
 it's synthetic intelligence and I prefer it official because in the worldartificial world art yeah you know what
 I mean also and synthetic means like yeahyou synthesize something yes no there's


Speaker 1 :no it's lacking of the human experience
 and artificial has that art yes well you

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you might you might be right because the
 only intelligent system we have now has smell oh really

Speaker 0 :ah okay very good I like it do you think


Speaker 1 :about mortality your own mortality yes


Speaker 0 :because there is a three elements to
 that one like I'm a normal person and I think about that Ohespecially in relation with parents when
 you lost you know yes and mom also so you know yes you cannot let somethingwhich happened to everybody
 at some point when you lose your father and mother you understand that now it'syou you're next
 that's into its well that's human the second element what I think about isreligion because at least for me but for
 many people also like going to beliefs of your parents grandparents etc helpshelps and you start to understand the
 older you are the closer you are to this moment the more you just feel it so allof the religion is huge and number three
 I'm a scientist and a couple of weeks ago we had a longdiscussion on the conference
 about immortality at the was of this cosmetic meeting because I mentioned toyou that with this LVMH like a Louboutin
 or whether um and Hennessy that's the

Speaker 1 :important one and then sporty one we
 have been talking about like a

Speaker 0 :possibility to change direction of Aging
 and this is one of challenges which actually in the beam of plasma medicinewe start trying to do it was like a kind
 of serious experiments trying to use in plasma tool to determine aging process Ican explain you details but it's a
 longer story but as a result of this experimentsunfortunately we show that in a hundred
 percent of like experiments we did we actually accelerated aging not but maybewe have two other ideas you might be


Speaker 1 :able to from a scientific perspective
 there is there is so hurt because you

Speaker 0 :know that mortality it just glad or
 major put it in us this mortality in which way we're stem cells and they justyou know providing differentiation which
 is like a renovation of us like when there is a tiny small kid he changed hisno siren on each couple of days so just
 it's it's always like a renovation of the tissue yes death and birth doesn't

Speaker 1 :birth yeah it is not like I thought like


Speaker 0 :it knows is like growing no it's just as
 each time I have a new one now when in your agelike I wasn't buying it happen less
 often maybe once and I don't know 5 10 years but for mefortunately are functioning like I will
 stay with this nose forever now so the only thing we have to do actually isjust to and this self themselves are
 still there we just but their efficiency is for some not very much known reasonwent down down down down down down so
 what we have to do we have to actually help this stem cells stimulate them justto become again more active and if we do
 that and plasma medicine tried then just you know instead of getting older andother will go back younger and younger
 is it possible yes it's against rule of natureno so this is sword way to think about
 that but that's a really challenge interesting that it was discussion onthis subject with leave it on if science


Speaker 1 :does arrive at that breaker if you could
 live forever would you would you like to

Speaker 0 :live forever I think yes I would try why
 not you know let's well I'll give you a

Speaker 1 :reason not is it makes a life you know
 the fact that stuff ends gives it some deep meaning you know Jewish people

Speaker 0 :basically they are deeply deeply deeply
 in love with life you know they say Lehigh to life so Jewish people theyactually believe that God gave us life
 to enjoy what will happen we'll have another life or not or maybe it will belike again we'll be young
 is it possible the Jewish answer is absolutely clear we don't know so butenjoying life it's the law
 absolute law so if you have possibility to leave you have to go on with life asa Jewish answer and I like it


Speaker 1 :are you afraid of death yes how you


Speaker 0 :remember when you asked me how long did
 you take for me to fall in love with

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :with your mother 1 2 3 yeah yeah yeah


Speaker 1 :you answered that pretty quickly so what
 do you think is the meaning of life

Speaker 0 :that's a difficult question you you


Speaker 1 :never like this the silly questions
 go back to your eighth grade self and be romantic for a second yeah what's the

Speaker 0 :meaning of life yeah meaning of our


Speaker 1 :existence here on this little planet
 well I remember that I kept asking

Speaker 0 :myself this question when I was in
 eighth grade it was one of the crucial question for me Oh at that time by theexactly the same time when I roll this
 romantic stuff and at that time I remember my answer I kept saying day byday which means the meaning of life is
 just to enjoy enjoy today's life and go to tomorrow

Speaker 1 :survive the day enjoy the day and use
 your French existentialists you're a researcher and yes sir

Speaker 0 :it's but you know at that time I didn't
 have any knowledge about exists sure lists whatever Sartor yeah specialisttartar but I was actually sure about
 that if you ask me now I would say I was right I I thought I thought that was a

Speaker 1 :natural extension of the axiom which is
 I'm always right yes yes yes but you

Speaker 0 :know in each joke it's a 50% of joke if
 you present not but after reading it was a book limo words right what's inEnglish you say soccer sorry
 limo words slower I think in this book he just when I read that it's basicallyabsolutely bad book fleet


Speaker 1 :yes archers I prefer Camus and the other


Speaker 0 :French guy yeah I just decide that I am
 I was not alone with this kind of ideas

Speaker 1 :yeah there's other French guys what do


Speaker 0 :you hope Greg and I accomplish in life
 and next I'll ask you for advice and

Speaker 1 :after that we'll drink some vodka


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :recalculating I know I'm not calculating


Speaker 0 :I'm just trying to recall a very nice
 poetry you know between I I love Russian poetry and it's interesting that myfavorite Russian poet it's actually the
 woman's it's a mini Nazi timer and she wrote like a short poetry just L sayingthat she said nationalist any
 rationalist Paul navona assumes a brief yet aside nobility post yes way mr.Spacely well and it is in Russian but I
 am I think that it's kind of deep and kind of smart I wish I wish you to behappy and I know that if I push you in
 some direction Earl Greg nothing happened I mean I okay I will bealways recommending they always push on
 you and and don't forget I am always pushing anyway but you know that and Ihave to do that because I am a father so
 I and I'm always pushing in conservative direction because because I am a fatherand I very much wish you to have your
 son my grandson or granddaughter yeah I almost guarantee you that will do thesame
 he will not recommend your daughter to take a risk and to go to Hollywood tryto be an actress she's supposed to do it
 without without your permission

Speaker 1 :what and as and that's that's that's
 beautiful who make our own way and there you always have given me a brilliantadvice that I almost never follow and
 usually disagree with so but that's the

Speaker 0 :way it should be
 yeah that's the way of life well so what

Speaker 1 :speaking of which what advice do you
 have for me for the next 10 20 years in

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :life sort of in any direction see I am
 hesitating I'm thinking about I mean I have two ideas and they're kind of verymuch wasn't yeah so from one hand my
 approach was the same as Sarah so just from one hand I like the idea just tolive your life and to enjoy and to be
 prepared for tomorrow which everything will restart again it's from one handfrom another hand I remember myself in
 elementary school he remember beginning of our discussion about this stupid guysthese idiots with stones and I just had
 an idea just to build a rocket to put there so I wanted to do and I did it sothis is another idea when you all just
 put your heart into something for a longer time not for one day but you haveto find your own way just and my feeling
 is it to you personally found it with artificial intelligence and that's whymy feeling is that in your specific case
 my advice will be just not to let them this idiots with stones to succeed youhave to deliver and that's what I'd like
 and that's what I made me dope with the

Speaker 1 :mercury in the rocket but build the
 rocket it's your choice

Speaker 0 :yeah because that's a rocket which
 you're building but what is important that you'll do

Speaker 1 :well I think this is a good time to uh
 to maybe toast our family oh they do some we thought we'll do we'll probablydrink more vodka but we decided to be
 responsible adults and just save the vodka to the end it's always a question

Speaker 0 :how much vodka we have to drink in
 Russian tradition usually we calculate for adults like a one bottle per onebottle per a person
 take a look at is made in Soviet Union and it's 1986 this is what girl of myfather because in 1986 in a year of
 Chernobyl he gave this bottle a friend of minebecause this friend of mine he went to
 America and he just missed my friend he just saved this basket for us to be ableto just whatever to think about no


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :seasoning of my friend oh he's Sasha but
 we call him Shura Shura but that's the same thing as your best friend your

Speaker 1 :lifelong friend yes it's like you're mad


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :mad mad matter any shoutout and first
 you can chose the family but let me just toast to the best dad I've ever had thebest that I could ever ask for our love
 you did yeah

Speaker 0 :I love you let's go
