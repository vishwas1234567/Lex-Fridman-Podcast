 Eric Weinstein the second time we've spoken on this podcast he's amathematician with the bold and piercing
 intelligence unafraid to explore the biggest questions in the universe andshine a light on the darkest corners of
 our society he is the host of the portal podcast a part of which he recentlyreleased his 2013 oxford lecture on his
 theory of geometric unity that is at the centre of his lifelong efforts to arriveat a theory of everything that unifies
 the fundamental laws of physics this conversation was recorded recently inthe time of the coroner virus pandemic

 here's my car session with Eric Weinsteinaction between World War two and the
 crisis we're living through right now

Speaker 0 :sure the need for collective action
 reminding ourselves of the fact that all of these abstractions like everyoneshould just do exactly what he or she
 wants to do for himself and leave everyone else alone none of theseabstractions work in a global crisis and
 this is just a reminder that we didn't somehow put all that behind us when I

Speaker 1 :hear stories about my grandfather who
 was in the army and so the Soviet Union where most people die when you're in thearmy there's a brotherhood that happens
 there's a love that happens do you think that's something we're going to see here

Speaker 0 :sense or none there I mean what the
 Soviet Union went through I mean the enormity of the war on the Russiandoorstep


Speaker 1 :this is different what we're going


Speaker 0 :through now is not we can't talk about
 Stalingrad and kovat in the same breath yet we're not ready and the the sort ofyou know that just the sense of like the
 Great Patriotic War and the way in which I was very moved by the Soviet custom ofnewlyweds going and visiting war
 memorials on their wedding day it's like the happiest day of your life you haveto say thank you to the people who made
 it possible we're not there where we're just restarting history we you know I'vecalled this on the Rogen program I
 called it the great nap yeah 75 years with very little by historical standardsand in in terms of really profound
 disruption and so when you called the

Speaker 1 :great nap meaning lack of deep global


Speaker 0 :tragedy well lack of realized global
 tragedy so I think the development for example of the hydrogen bomb you knowwas something that happened during the
 great nap and that doesn't mean that people who lived during that time didn'tfeel feared and no anxiety but it was to
 say that most of the violent potential of human species was not realized it wasin the form of potential energy and this
 is the thing that I've sort of taken issue with with theof Steven Pinker's optimism is that if
 you look at they realized kinetic variables things have been getting muchbetter for a long time which is the
 great nap but it's not as if our fragility has not grown our dependenceon electronic systems our vulnerability
 to disruption and so all sorts of things have gotten much better what otherthings have gotten much worse in the
 destructive potential of skyrocketed its

Speaker 1 :tragedy the only way we wake up from the


Speaker 0 :big nap well no you could also have you
 know jubilation about positive things but it's harder to get people's

Speaker 1 :attention can you give an example of a
 big global positive thing well I could

Speaker 0 :happen I think that when for example
 just historically speaking HIV went from being a death sentence to something thatpeople could live with for a very long
 period of time it would be great if that had happened on a Wednesday right likeall at once like you knew that things
 had changed and so the bleed in somewhat kills the sort of the Wednesday effectwhere it all happens on a particular day
 at a particular moment I think if you look at the stock market here you knowthere's a very clear moment where you
 can see that the market absorbs the idea of the coronavirus I think that withrespect to positives the moon landing
 was the best example of a positive that happened at a particular time orrecapitulating the Soviet American
 link-up in terms of Skylab and Soyuz right like that was a huge moment whenyou actually had these two nations
 connecting in orbit and so yeah there are great moments where somethingbeautiful and wonderful and amazing
 happens you know but it's just they're fewer that's why that's why as much as Ican't imagine proposing to somebody at a
 sporting event when you have like 30,000 people waiting and you know like shesays yes that's pretty exciting
 so I think that we shouldn't we

Speaker 1 :shouldn't discount that so how bad do
 you think it's going to get in terms of the global suffering that we're goingto experience with this with this crisis


Speaker 0 :I can't figure this one out
 I'm just not smart enough something is goin weirdly wrong and they're almostlike two separate storylines we in one
 storyline we aren't taking things nearly seriously enough we see people usingfood packaging lids as masks who are
 doctors or nurses we hear horrible stories about people dying needlesslydue to triage and that's a very
 terrifying story on the other hand there's this other story which saysthere are tons of ventilators someplace
 we've got lots of masks but they haven't been releasedwe've got hospital ships where none of
 the beds are being used and it's very confusing to me that somehow these twostories give me the feeling that they
 both must be true simultaneously and they can't both be true in any kind ofstandard way well I don't know whether
 it's just that I'm dumb but I can't get one or the other story to quiet down soI think weirdly this is much more
 serious than we had understood it and it's not nearly as serious as somepeople are making it out to be at the
 same time and that we're not being given the tools to actually understand wellhere's how to interpret the data or
 here's the issue with the personal protective equipment is actually ajurisdictional battle or a question of
 who pays for it rather than a question of whether it's present or apps I don'tunderstand the details of it but
 something is wildly off in our ability to understand where we are so that's

Speaker 1 :that's policy that's institutions what
 about do you think about the quiet suffering of millions of people they'velost their job is this a temporary thing
 I mean what I'm my ears not to the suffering of those people who have losttheir job or the 50% possibly of small
 businesses that are gonna go bankrupt do you think about that sure it's sufferingwell and how that might arise itself


Speaker 0 :could be not quiet - I mean right that's
 the could be a depression this could go from recessiondepression and depression could go to
 armed conflict and then to war so it's not a very abstract causal chain thatgets us to the point where we can begin
 with quiet suffering and an anxiety and all of these sorts of things and peoplelosing their jobs and people dying from
 stress and all sorts of things but look anything powerful enough to put us allin doors in a I mean think about this as
 an incredible experiment imagine that you proposed hey I want to do a bunch ofresearch let's figure out what what
 changes in our emissions emissions profiles for our carbon footprints whenwe're all indoors or what happens to
 traffic patterns or what happens to the vulnerability of retail sales as Amazongets stronger you know etc etc I believe
 that in many of those situations we're running an incredible experiment and amI worried for us all yes there are some
 bright spots one of which is that when you're ordered to stay indoors peopleare gonna feel entitled and the usual
 thing that people are going to hit when they hear that they've lost your job youknow some there's this kind of tough
 [Music] tough love attitude that you seeparticularly in the United States like
 oh you lost your job poor baby well go retrain get another one I thinkthere's gonna be a lot less appetite for
 that because we've been asked to sacrifice to risk to act collectivelyand that's the interesting thing
 what does that really can in us maybe the idea that we actually are Nationsand then you know your fellow countrymen
 may start to mean something to more people certainly mean something topeople in the military but I wonder how
 many people who aren't in the military start to think about this it's like ohyeah we are kind of running separate
 experiments and we are not china so you

Speaker 1 :think this is kind of a period that
 might be studied for years to come from my perspective we are a part of theexperi
 but I don't feel like we have access to the full data the full data of theexperiment we're just like little mice
 yeah in a large does this one make sense

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :to you Lex I'm romanticizing it and I
 keep connecting it to World War two so I keep connecting to historical events andmaking sense of them through that way
 or reading the plague by Camus like almost kind of telling narratives andstories but my I'm not hearing the
 suffering that people are going through because I think that's quieteverybody's numb currently they're not
 realising what it means to have lost your job and to have lost your businessthere's kind of a I am
 I'm afraid how that fear well material

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :as itself once the numbness wears out


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and especially if this lasts for many
 months then if it's connected to the incompetence of the CDC in the w-h-o andour government and perhaps the election
 process you know might be biggest fear is that the you know elections getdelayed or something like that so the
 the basic mechanisms of our democracy get slowed or damaged in some way thatthen mixes with the fear that people
 have that turns to panic that turns to anger that anger can I just play with

Speaker 0 :that for a butcher what if in fact all
 of that structure that you grew up thinking about and again you grew up intwo places right so when you were inside
 the US we tend to look at all of these things as museum pieces like how oftendo we amend the Constitution anymore and
 in some sense if you think about the Jewish tradition of Simchat Torah you'vegot this beautiful scroll that has been
 lovingly hand drawn in calligraphy that's very valuable and it's veryimportant that you not treat it
 as a relic to be revered and so we one day a year we dance with the Torah andwe hold this incredibly vulnerable
 document up and we treat it as if you know it was Ginger Rogers being led byFred Astaire well that is how you become
 part of your country in fact maybe the maybe the election will be delayed maybeextraordinary powers will be used maybe
 any one of a number of things will indicate that you're actually livingthrough history this isn't a museum
 piece that you handed by your great-great grandparents but you're kind

Speaker 1 :of suggesting that there might be a like
 a community thing that pops up lucky like as opposed to an angry revolutionit might have a positive effect oh well


Speaker 0 :for example are you telling me that if
 the right person stood up and called for us to sacrifice PPE for our nurses andour MDS who are on the front lines that
 like people wouldn't reach down deep in their own supply that they've been likestalking and carefully storing they just
 said here take it like right now an actual leader woulduse this time to bring out the heroic
 character and I'm going to just go wildly patriotic cuz I freaking lovethis country we've got this dormant
 population in the u.s. that loves leadership and country and pride in ourfreedom and not being told what to do
 and we still have this thing that binds us together and all of them themerchants of division just be gone I


Speaker 1 :totally agree with you there's a I think
 there is a deep hunger for that leadership why isn't that why hasn't one

Speaker 0 :of yours we don't have the right Surgeon
 General we have as guys saying you know come on guys don't buy masks they don'treally work for you save them for our
 healthcare professionals no you can't do that you have to say you know what thesemasks will actually do work and they
 more work to protect other people from you but they would work for youthey'll keep you somewhat safer if you
 wear them here's the deal you've got somebody who's taking huge amounts ofviral load all the time because the
 patients are shedding do you want to protect that person who's volunteered tobe on the frontline who's up sleepless
 nights he you just changed the message you stop lying to people you just yeahyou level with them it's like it's bad


Speaker 1 :absolutely but that's uh that's a little
 bit specific so you you have to be just honest about the facts of the situationyes but I think you were referring to
 something bigger than just that yes inspiring like you know rewriting theConstitution sort of rethinking how we


Speaker 0 :work as a nation yeah I think you should
 probably you know amend the Constitution once or twice in a lifetime so that youdon't get this distance from the
 foundational documents and you know part of the problem is that we've got twogenerations on top that feel very
 connected to the US they feel bought in and we've got three generations belowit's a little bit like watching your
 parents riding the tricycle that they were supposed to pass on to you and it'slike you're now too old to ride a
 tricycle and they're still whooping it up ringing the bell with the streamerscoming off the handlebars and you're
 just thinking do you guys never get bored do you never pass a torch do youreally want it we had five
 septuagenarians all born in the 40s running for president the United Stateswhen cloture dropped out the youngest
 was Warren we had Warren Biden Sanders Bloomberg and Trump for like 1949 to1941 all who have been the the oldest
 president and inauguration and nobody nobody says grandma grandpa you're

Speaker 1 :embarrassing us except Joe Rogan let me
 put it on you you have a big platform you're somewhat of an intelligenteloquent guy what what role do you
 somewhat what role do you play why aren't you that leader well you're Imean I would argue that you're in in
 ways becoming that leader so I haven't

Speaker 0 :taken enough risk is that your idea what
 should I do or say at the moment no

Speaker 1 :you're a little bit
 you have taken quite a big risks and we'll talk about it all right but you'realso on the outside shooting in meaning
 you're dismantling the institution from the outside as opposed to becoming whatthe institution


Speaker 0 :did you remember that thing you brought
 up when you were on the view if you I'm

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :sorry when you were on Oprah I didn't


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :make I didn't get the end I'm sorry when
 you were on Bill Maher's program what was that thing you were saying theydon't know we're here they may watch us
 yeah they may quietly to us you know slip us a direct message but theypretend that this internet thing is some
 dangerous place where only lunatics play

Speaker 1 :well who has the bigger platform the
 portal or Bill Maher's program or the

Speaker 0 :view Bill Maher in the view in terms of


Speaker 1 :viewership or in terms of what's the


Speaker 0 :metric of size well first of all the key
 thing is take take a newspaper and they even imagine that it's completely fakeokay and then there's very little in the
 way of circulation yet imagine that it's a hundred-year-old paper and that it'sstill part of this game
 this internal game of media the key point is is that those sources that havethat kind of mark of respectability to
 the institutional structures matter in a way that even if I say something at avery large platform that makes a lot of
 sense if it's outside of what I've called the gated institutional narrativeor gin it sort of doesn't make matter to
 the institutions so the game is if it happens outside of the club we canpretend that it never happened how can


Speaker 1 :you get the credibility and authority
 from outside the gated institutional

Speaker 0 :narrative I'm well first of all you you
 and I both share institutional credibility coming from our associationswe were both at MIT yes were you at
 Harvard at any point nope

Speaker 1 :okay well and lived in Harvard Square so


Speaker 0 :did I but you know at some level it the
 issue isn't whether you have credentials in that sense the key question is canyou be trusted to file a flight plan and
 not deviate from that flight plan when you are in an interview situation willyou stick to the talking points I will
 not and that's why you're not going to be allowed in the general conversationwhich amplifies these sentiments but I'm


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :still trying to see your point it would
 be is that we're let's say both so you've done how many Joe Rogan beforeI've done for two right so both of us
 are somewhat frequent guests the show is huge you know the power as well as I doand people are gonna watch this
 conversation huge number watched our last one by the way that I want to thankyou for that one that was a terrific
 terrific conversation really did change my life lecture my life you're brilliantinterviewer so thank you take care that


Speaker 1 :was that you changed my life to that you
 gave me a chance

Speaker 0 :so no no I'm so glad I did that one what
 I would say is is that we keep mistaking how big the audience is for whether ornot you have the kiss and the kiss is a


Speaker 1 :different thing yes yeah that's it


Speaker 0 :doesn't it's not an acronym yet okay um
 it's thank you for asking it's a question of are you part of theinter interoperable institution friendly
 discussion and that's the discussion which we ultimately have to break into

Speaker 1 :but that's what I'm trying to get at is
 how do we how do you how does Eric Weinstein become the president of the

Speaker 0 :United States me I shouldn't become the
 president of the United States not interested thank you very much for us

Speaker 1 :okay get into a leadership position
 where I guess I don't know what that meansbut where you can inspire millions of
 people to the inspire the sense of community inspire the the kind of actionis required to overcome hardship the
 kind of hardship that we may be experiencing to inspire people to workhard and face the difficult hard facts
 of the realities we're living through all those kinds of things thatyou're talking about that leader you
 know cannot leader emerge from the current institutions or alternativelycan it also emerge from the outside I


Speaker 0 :guess that's what I was asking so my
 belief is is that this is the last hurrah for the elderly centristkleptocrats


Speaker 1 :can you define each of those terms okay


Speaker 0 :elderly I mean people who were born at
 least a year before I was that's a joke you can laugh no because I'm born at thecusp of the Gen X boomer divides
 centrist they're pretending you know that there are two parties Democrat andRepublican Party in the United States I
 think it's easier to think of the mainstream of both of them as part of aan aggregate party that I sometimes call
 the looting party which gets us to kleptocracy which is ruled by thievesand the great temptation has been to
 treat the us like a trough and you just have to get yours because it's not likewe're doing anything productive so
 everybody's sort of looting the family mansion and somebody stole the silverand somebody's cutting the pictures out
 of the frames you know roughly speaking we're watching our elders live it up ina way that doesn't make sense to the


Speaker 1 :rest of us okay so if it's let the last
 hoorah this is the time for leaders to

Speaker 0 :step up like we're not ready yet we're
 not ready I call I call out you know the head of the CDC should resign shouldresign that the Surgeon General should
 resign Trump should resign Pelosi should resign de Blasio should we're not goingto resign I understand that so that's
 why so we'll wait no but that s not how

Speaker 1 :revolutions work you don't wait for
 people to design you step up and inspire

Speaker 0 :the alternative do you remember the
 Russian Revolution of 1907 it's before

Speaker 1 :my time but there wasn't a Russian


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :Revolution of 1907 years think he were


Speaker 0 :in 1907 that I'm saying where to work
 you too early but we got this

Speaker 1 :you know Spanish flu came in 1718 so
 I would argue that there's a lot of parallels there or the one I think it's

Speaker 0 :not time yet
 like John Prine the the songwriter just died of kovat that was a pretty big

Speaker 1 :really yeah by the way you yes of course


Speaker 0 :I every time we do this we discover our


Speaker 1 :mutual appreciation of obscure brilliant


Speaker 0 :witty yeah song right he's really he's


Speaker 1 :really quite good right he's he's really
 good yeah he died my understanding is

Speaker 0 :that he passed recently due to
 complications of Corona so we haven't had large enough enough large ink largeenough shocking deaths yet picturesque
 deaths deaths of a family that couldn't get treatment there are stories thatwill come and break our hearts and we
 have not had enough of those the visuals haven't come in but I think they'recoming well we'll find out but that you


Speaker 1 :got a you have to be there he have to be


Speaker 0 :there when they come I'm yet but we
 didn't get the visual for example a falling man from 9/11 right so theoutside world did but Americans were not
 I was thought that we would be too delicate so just the way you rememberpule a surprise wedding photographs from
 the Vietnam era you don't easily remember thephotographs from all sorts of things
 that have happened since because something changed in our media we areincensed that we cannot feel or
 experience our own lives and the tragedy that would animate us to action yeah but

Speaker 1 :I think there again I think there's
 going to be that suffering that's going to build and build and build in terms ofbusinesses mom-and-pop shops that close
 and like I think for myself I think off

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :tonight that I'm being weak and and like
 I feel like I should be doing something I should be becoming a leader on a small

Speaker 0 :scale you can't this is not World War
 two and this is not Soviet Russia why not why not because our internalprogramming the malware that sits
 between our ears is much different than the propaganda ismalware of the Soviet era I mean people
 were both very indoctrinated and also knew that it was BS they had a doublemind
 I don't know him there must be a great word in Russian for being able to thinkboth of those things simultaneously you


Speaker 1 :don't think people are actually sick of
 the partisanship sick of incompetence

Speaker 0 :yeah but I call for revolt the other day
 on Joe Rogan people found it quixotic

Speaker 1 :well because I think you're not
 I think revolt is different I think asks

Speaker 0 :like okay I'm really angry
 yes I'm furious I cannot stand that this is my country at the moment I am

Speaker 1 :embarrassed so let's build a better one
 yeah that's the I mean okay so well okay

Speaker 0 :so let's take over a few universities
 let's start running a different experiment at some of our better thanuniversities like when I did this
 experiment I said what at this if this were 40 years ago the median age Ibelieve of a university president was 51
 that would have the person in Gen X and we'd have a bunch of millennialpresidents a bunch of you know more than
 half Gen X it's almost 100% baby boom at this moment and how did that happen wecan get into how they changed retirement
 but this generation above us does not feel for even even the older generous Ilove jittery I had roger penrose on my
 program excellent coffee and I thank you really appreciate that and I asked noquestion it was very important to me and
 I said look you're in your late 80s is there anyone you could point to as asuccessor that we should be watching we
 can get excited you know I said here's an opportunity to pass the baton and hesaid well let me let me hold off on that
 is it ever the right moment to point to somebody younger than you to keep yourflame alive after you're gone and also
 like I don't know whether I'm just gonna admit to this people treat me like I'mcrazy for caring about the
 world after him dead or wanting to be remembered after you're gone like wellwhat does it matter to you you're gone
 it's this deeply sort of secular somatic perspective on everything we're we wedon't you know that phrase in as time
 goes by it says it's still the same old story a fight for love and glory a caseof do it I don't think people imagined
 then that there wouldn't be a story about fighting for love and glory andlike we are so out of practice about
 fighting you know rivals for love and and and in fighting for glory andsomething bigger than yourself but the


Speaker 1 :hunger is there well that was the point


Speaker 0 :then right the whole idea is that Rick
 was you know it was like Han Solo of his time he's just like I stick my neck outfor nobody you know it's like oh come on
 Rick you're just pretending you actually have a big soul right and so at somelevel that's the question do we have a
 big Soler's it's just all [ __ ]

Speaker 1 :see I think I think there's huge
 Manhattan Project style projects whether you talk about physical infrastructureor going to Mars
 you know the SpaceX NASA efforts or huge huge scientific efforts well let me get

Speaker 0 :back into the institutions and we need
 to remove the weak leadership that we have weak leaders and the weak leadersneed to be removed and they need to seat
 people more dangerous than the people who are currently sitting in a lot ofthose chairs or build new institutions


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :good luck


Speaker 1 :well I one of the nice things of from
 the internet is for example somebody like you can have a bigger voice thanalmost anybody at the particular
 institutions we're talking about that's

Speaker 0 :true but the thing is I might say
 something you can count on the fact that the you know Provost at Princeton isn'tgoing to say anything what do you mean


Speaker 1 :too afraid


Speaker 0 :well if that person were to give an
 interview how are things going in in in research at Princetonwell I'm hesitant to say it but they're
 perhaps as good as they've ever been and I think they're gonna getbetter oh is that right all fields yep
 oh yeah I don't see a weak one that's just like okay greatwho are you and what it even say we're
 just used to total nonsense 24/7 yeah

Speaker 1 :what do you think might be a beautiful
 thing that comes out of this like what is there a hope it like a little inklinga little fire of hope you have about our


Speaker 0 :time right now yeah I think one thing is
 coming to understand that the freaks weirdos mutants and other narrow duelssometimes referred to as grifters I like
 that one grifters and gadflies were very oftenthe earliest people on the crown of iris
 that's a really interesting question why was that and it seems to be that theyhad already paid such a social price
 that they weren't going to be beaten up by being told that oh my god you'rexenophobic you just hate China you know
 or wow you sound like a conspiracy theorist so if you've already paid thoseprices you were free to think about this
 and everyone in an institutional framework was terrified that they didn'twant to be seen as the alarmist the
 Chicken Little and so that's why you have this confidence where you know deBlasio says you know get on with your
 lives get back in there and celebrate Chinese New Year in Chinatowndespite coronavirus it's like okay
 really so you just always thought everything would automatically be okayif you if you adapted sorry if you
 adopted that posture so you think this

Speaker 1 :time reveals the weakness of our
 institutions and reveals the strength of our gadflies and the weirdos and no not

Speaker 0 :necessary the strength but the the the
 value of freedom like a different way of saying it would be Wow even yourgadflies and your grifters were able to
 beat your institutional folks because your institutional folks we're playingwith a giant mental handicap so just
 imagine like you're in the story of Harrison Bergeronby Vonnegut and our smartest people were
 all subjected to distracting noises every seven seconds well they would befunctionally much dumber because they
 couldn't continue a thought through all the disturbance so in some sense that'sa little bit like what belonging to an
 institution is is that if you have to make a public statement of course thesearch in general is going to be the
 worst because they're just playing with too much of a handicap they're too manyinstitutional players really don't screw
 us up and so the person has to say something wrong we're gonna backpropagate a falsehood and this is very
 interesting some of my socially oriented friends say Eric I don't understand whatyou're on about of course masks work but
 you know what they're trying to do they're trying to get us not to buy upthe masks for the doctors and I think
 okay so you imagine that we can just create scientific fiction at will sothat you can run whatever social program
 you want this is what I mean my point is get out of my lab get out of the lab youdon't belong in the lab you're not meant
 for the lab you're constitutionally incapable of being around the lab youneed to leave the lab you think the CDC


Speaker 1 :and whu-oh knew that masks work and
 we're trying to sort of imagine that people are kind of stupidand they would buy masks and in in
 excess if they were told that masks work is that like because this does seem tobe a particularly clear example of
 mistakes made you're asking me this

Speaker 0 :question yeah no you're not what do you
 think Lex well I actually probably

Speaker 1 :disagree with you a little bit great


Speaker 0 :let's do it


Speaker 1 :I think it's not so easy to be honest


Speaker 0 :with the populace when the danger of


Speaker 1 :panic is always around the corner so hmm


Speaker 0 :I I think the kind of honesty you


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :exhibit appeals to a certain class of
 brave intellectual minds that it appeals to me but I don't knowthe perspective wh Oh I don't know if
 it's so obvious that they should be honest 100% of the time with people I'm

Speaker 0 :not saying you should be perfectly
 transparent and 100% honest I'm saying that the quality of your lies has to bevery high and asked my public spirited
 is there a big difference between so I'm not not a child about this yeahI'm not saying that when you're at war
 for example you turn over all of your plans to the enemy because it'simportant that you're transparent with
 360 degree visibility far from it what I'm saying is something has beenforgotten and I forgot who it was who
 told it to me it was a fellow graduate student in the harvard math departmentand he said you know i learned one thing
 being out in the workforce because he was one of the few people who had a worklife in the department as a grad student
 and he said you can be friends with your boss but if you're going to be friendswith your boss you have to be doing a
 good job at work and there's an analog here which is if you're going to bereasonably honest with the population
 you have to be doing a good job at work as the Surgeon General or as the head ofthe CDC so if you're doing a terrible
 job you're supposed to resign and then the next person is supposed to say lookI'm not gonna lie to you I inherited the
 situation it was in a bit of disarray but I had several requirements before Iagreed to step in and take the job
 because I needed to know I could turn it around I needed to know that I had clearlines of authority I needed to know that
 I had the resources available in order to rectify the problem and I needed toknow that I had the ability in the
 freedom to level with the American people directly as I saw fit all of mywishes were granted and that's why I'm
 happy here on Monday morning I've got my sleeves rolled up boy do we got a lot todo so please come back in two weeks and
 then ask me how I'm doing then and I hope to have something to show youthat's how you do it so why is that


Speaker 1 :excellence and basic competence missing


Speaker 0 :the big nap you see you come from
 multiple traditions where it was very important to remember thingsthe Soviet tradition made sure that you
 remembered the sacrifices that came in that war in the Jewish tradition we'redoing this on Passover right okay well
 every year we tell one simple story well why can't it be different every yearmaybe we can have a rotating series of
 sevens do it because it's the one story that you need it's like you know youwork with the men in black group right
 and it's the last suit that you'll ever need this is the last story that youever need don't think I fell for your
 neuralyzer last time in any event we tell one story because it's to get outof Dodge story there's a time when you
 need to not wait for the the bread to rise and that's the thing which is evenif you live through a great nap you
 deserve to know what it feels like to have to leave everything that has becomecomfortable and and unworkable


Speaker 1 :it's said that you need you need that
 tragedy I imagine to have the tradition of remembering it's it's sad to to thinkthat because things have been nice and
 comfortable means that we can't have great competent leaders which is kind ofthe implied statement like can we have
 great leaders who take big risks or who inspire hard work who deal withdifficult truth even though things have


Speaker 0 :been comfortable well we know what those
 people sound like I mean you know if for example Jocko willing suddenly threw hishat into the ring everyone would say
 okay right party's over it's time to get up at 4:30 and really work hard andwe've got to get back into fighting [ __ ]


Speaker 1 :and yeah but Jocko is a very special I
 think that whole group of people by profession put themselves in the way ofand into hardship on a daily basis and
 he's not well I don't know but he's probably not going to beokay Jocko be president okay but it


Speaker 0 :doesn't have to be Jocko right like in
 other words if it was Kyle ne or if it was Alex Honnold from rock-climbingright but they're just serious people
 they're serious people who can't afford

Speaker 1 :your BS yeah but why do we have serious
 people that do rock climbing and don't have serious people who lead the nation

Speaker 0 :that that seems because that was a those
 skills needed in rock climbing are not good during the big nap and at the tailend of the big nap they would get you
 fired

Speaker 1 :but I don't don't you think there's a
 fundamental part of human nature that desires to excel to be exceptionally

Speaker 0 :good at your job yeah but what is your
 job I mean in other words my my point to you is if you if you're a general in apeacetime army and your major activity
 is playing war games what if the skills needed to win war games are verydifferent than the skills needed to win
 wars because you know how the war games are scored and you've you've doneMoneyball for example with wargames you
 figured out how to win games on paper so then the the advancement skill becomesdivergent from the ultimate skill that
 it was proxying for yeah but you create

Speaker 1 :this we're good as human beings to I
 mean I thought at least me I can't do a big nap so at any one moment when Ifinish something a new dream pops up so


Speaker 0 :right going to Mars go to what do you
 like to do you like to do Brazilian Jujitsu well first of all I like to do

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :every you like to play guitar guitar you
 do this podcast you do theory you're always you're constantly taking risksand exposing yourself all right why
 because you got one of those crazy I'm sorry to say it you got an EasternEuropean Jewish personality which I'm
 still tied to and I'm a couple generations more distant than you areand I've held on to that thing because
 it's valuable to me you don't think

Speaker 1 :there's a huge percent of the populace
 even in the United States that's that's that oh maybe a little bit doormen

Speaker 0 :but do you know Anna Hutchins from the
 Red Scare podcast did you interview her

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah she was great


Speaker 0 :she was great right yeah it's just fun
 she's she's terrific but she also has the same thing going onand I made a joke in the liner notes for
 that episode which is somewhere on the road from Stalingrad to forever 21something was lost like how can
 Stalingrad and forever 21 be in the same sentence and you know in part it's thatweird thing it's like trying to remember
 even words like I mean Russian and Hebrew things like it's like what poemyet and this core you know these words
 have much more potency about memory and

Speaker 1 :I don't know I do I think I think
 there's still a dormant populace that craves leaders on a small scan largescale and I hope to be that leader and
 on a small scale and I think you sir have a role to be a leader you kids go

Speaker 0 :ahead without me I'm just gonna I'm
 gonna do a little bit of weird podcasting see see now you're you're

Speaker 1 :putting on your Joe Rogan hat he says
 I'm just a comedian oh no I'm gonna say I'm just it's not that if I say I want

Speaker 0 :to lead too much because of the big nap
 there's like a group a chorus of automated idiots and they're there firstI was like oh I knew it
 it's a power grab all along why should you leave you know it's just like and sothe idea is you're just trying to skirt
 around not stepping on all of the idiot landmines it's like okay so now I'mgonna hear that in my inbox for the next
 three days

Speaker 1 :okay so lead by example just live no I


Speaker 0 :mean large platform look we should take
 over the institutions there are institutions we've got bad leadership weshould mutiny and we should inject a 15%
 20% disagreeable dissident very aggressive loner individual mutantfreaks all the people that you go to see
 Avengers movies about or the x-men or whatever it is and stop pretending thateverything good comes out of some great
 giant inclusive communal 12-hour meeting it's like stop itthat's not how [ __ ] happens you recently


Speaker 1 :published the video of a lecture he gave
 at Oxford presenting some aspects of a theory theory of everything calledgeometric unity so this was a work of 30
 30 plus years this is his life's work let me ask her of the silly old questionhow do you feel as a human excited
 scared the experience of posting it you

Speaker 0 :know it's funny one of the one of the
 things that you you learn to feel as an academic is the great sins you cancommit in academics is to show yourself
 to be a non-serious person to show yourself to have delusions to avoid thestandard practices which everyone has
 signed up for and you know it's weird because like you know that those peopleare gonna be angry he did what you know
 why would he do that and and what we're

Speaker 1 :referring to for example as traditions
 of sort of publishing incrementally certainly not trying to have a theory ofeverything perhaps working within the
 academic departments yeah all those

Speaker 0 :things so that's true and so you're


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :going outside of all of that well I mean
 I was going inside of all of that and we did not come to terms when I was insideand what they did was so outside to me
 was so weird so freakish like the most senior respectable people at the mostsenior respectable places were
 functionally insane as far as I could tell and again it's like beingfunctionally stupid if you're the head
 of the CDC or something where you know you're giving recommendations out therearen't based on what you actually
 believe they're based on what you think you have to be doing well in some senseI think that that's a lot of how I saw
 the math and physics world as the physics world was really crazy and themath world was considerably less crazy
 just very strict and kind of

Speaker 1 :dogmatic will psychoanalyze those folks
 but I really want to maybe linger on it a little bit longer of how you feelbecause yeah so it's such a such a


Speaker 0 :special moment in your life I really
 appreciate it's a great question so that if we can pair off some of that othersthose other issues its new being able to
 say what the observer's is which is my attempt to replace space-time withsomething that is both closely related
 to space time and not space-time so I used to carry the number 14 as a closelyguarded secret in my life and where 14
 is really four dimensions of space and time plus ten extra dimensions of rulersand protractors or four the cool kids
 out there symmetric to tensors she had a

Speaker 1 :geometric complicated beautiful
 geometric view of the world that you carry with you for a long time yeah didyou did you have friends that you


Speaker 0 :colleagues essentially no talk no in
 fact part of these part of that some of these stories are me coming out to myfriends and I used the phrase coming out
 because I think that gays have monopolized the concept of the closetmany of us are in closets haven't having
 nothing to do with their sexual orientation yeah I didn't really feelcomfortable talking to almost anyone so
 this was a closely guarded secret and I think that I let on in some ways that Iwas up to something and probably but it
 was a very weird life so I did write I have a series of things that I pretendedto care about so that I could use that
 as the stalking horse for what I really cared about and to your point I neverunderstood this whole thing about
 theories of everything like if you were gonna go into something like theoreticalphysics isn't that what you would
 normally pursue like wouldn't it be crazy to do something that difficult andthat poorly paid if you we're gonna try
 to do something other than figure out what this is all about now I have to

Speaker 1 :reveal my cards my weaknesses and lack
 an understanding of the music of physics and math departments but there's ananalogy here to artificial intelligence
 and often folks come in and say okay so there's a giant department working onquote-unquote artificial intelligence
 but why is nobody actually working on

Speaker 0 :intelligence like it you're all just


Speaker 1 :building little toys right you're not
 actually trying to understand and that breaks a lot of people and that they itconfuses them it's like okay so I'm at
 MIT I'm at Stanford I'm at Harvard I'm here I dreamed of being what kind ofartificial intelligence why is everybody
 not actually working on intelligence and I have the same kind of sense thatthat's what working on the theory of
 everything is that's strangely you somehow become an outcast for even but

Speaker 0 :we know why this is right why well it's
 because let's take the artificial it's play with a GI for example yeah I thinkthat the idea starts off with nobody
 really knows how to work on that and so if we don't know how to work on it wechoose instead to work on a program that
 is tangentially related to it so we do a component of a program that is relatedto that big question because it's felt
 like at least I can make progress there and that wasn't where I was where I wasin it's funny there was this book of
 called Friedan uhlan beck and it had this weird mysterious line in thebeginning of it and I tried to get
 clarification of this weird mysterious line and everyone said wrong things andthen I said okay well so I can tell that
 nobody's thinking properly because I just asked the entire department andnobody has a correct interpretation of
 this and so you know it's a little bit like you see a crime-scene photo and youhave a different idea like there's a
 smoking gun and you figure that's actually a cigarette lighter I don'treally believe that and then there's
 like a pack of cards and you think huh that looks like the blunt instrumentthat the person was beaten with you know
 so you have a very different idea about how things go and very quickly yourealize that there's no one thinking
 about them

Speaker 1 :there's a few human-sized to this and
 technical size both of which I'd love to try to get down to so the human side Ican tell from my perspective I think it
 was before April 1st and April Fool's maybe the day before I forget but I waslaying in bed in the middle of the night
 and somehow it popped up you know i am i feed somewhere that your beautiful faceis speaking live and i clicked and you
 know it's kind of weird how the universe just brings things together in this kindof way and all sudden i realized that
 there's something big happening in this particular moment is strange like anyday on a day like any day and all of a
 sudden you were thinking of you had this somber tone like you were serious likeyou were going through some difficult


Speaker 0 :decision and it seems strange I almost


Speaker 1 :thought you were maybe joking but
 there's a serious decision being made and it was a wonderful experience to go

Speaker 0 :through with you I really appreciate it
 it was April 1st yeah it was it's kind

Speaker 1 :of fascinating him he's just the whole
 experience and and and so that I want to ask I mean thank you for letting me bepart of that kind of journey of
 decision-making that took 30 years but why now why did you thinkwhy did you struggle so long not to
 release it and decide to release it now Anna while the whole world is onlockdown an April Fool's is it just
 because you like the comedy of absurd ways that the universe comes together I

Speaker 0 :don't think so I think that the Cova
 Depa demmick is the end of the big nap and I think that I actually tried thisseven years earlier in Oxford so I and
 it was too early which part was too is

Speaker 1 :it the the platform because your plight
 different now actually the Internet I remember you I read several yourbrilliant answers that people should
 read for the edge one of them was related to the Internetand it was the first one was it the


Speaker 0 :first one yeah that's a called go


Speaker 1 :virtual young man yeah yeah that seemed
 that's like forever ago now

Speaker 0 :well that was ten years ago and that's
 exactly what I did is I decamped to the Internet which is where the portal lives

Speaker 1 :the portal the portal yeah the theme
 that's ramen esteem music he just listened to forever I actually started

Speaker 0 :recording tiny guitar licks for the
 audio portion not for the video portion you kind of inspired me with bringingyour guitar into the story but keep


Speaker 1 :going you see you thought so the Oxford
 was like step one you kind of yet you put your foot into the in the water tosample it but it was too cold at the
 time so you didn't want to step in just

Speaker 0 :really disappointed what was


Speaker 1 :disappointing about that experience very


Speaker 0 :is it's a hard thing to talk about it
 has to do with the fact that and I can see this in this you know as mirrors adisappointment within myself there are
 two separate issues one is the issue of making sure that the idea is actuallyheard and explored and the other is the
 is the question about will I become disconnected from my work because itwill be ridiculed it will it will be
 immediately improved it will be found to be derivative of something that occurredin some paper in 1957 when the community
 does not want you to gain a voice it's a little bit like a policeman deciding toweirdly and enforce all of these
 little-known regulations against you and you know sometimes nobody else and Ithink that's kind of you know this weird
 thing where I just don't believe that we can reach the final theory necessarilywithin the political economy of
 academics so if you think about how academics are tortured by each other andhave their paid and where they have
 freedom and where they don't I actually weirdly think that thatsystem of selective pressures is going
 to eliminate anybody who's going to make real progress so that's interesting so

Speaker 1 :if you look at
 the story of Andrew Wiles for example with from last Last Theorem he as far asI understand he pretty much isolated
 himself from the world of academics in terms of the big with the bulk of thework he did and it from my perspective
 is dramatic and fun to read about but it seemed exceptionally stressful the firststep he took the first steps he took
 when actually making the work public that's him to me would be hell now but

Speaker 0 :it's like so artificially dramatic you
 know he leads up to it at a series of lectures he doesn't want to say it andthen he finally says it at the end
 because obviously this comes out of a body of work where I mean the funny partabout for Moz le'ts theorem is that
 wasn't originally thought to be a deep and meaningful problem it was just aneasy to state one that had gone unsolved
 but if you think about it it became attached to the body of regular theoryso he built up this body of regular
 theory gets all the way up to the end announces and then like there's thiswhole drama about okay somebody's
 checking the proof I don't understand what's going on on line 37 you know andlike oh is this serious seems a little
 bit more serious than we knew I mean do

Speaker 1 :you see parallels you share the concern
 that the year your experience might be something similar well in his case I

Speaker 0 :think that if I recall correctly his
 original proof was unsalvageable he actually came up with a second proofwith a colleague Richard Taylor and it
 was that second proof which carried the day so it was a little bit that he gotput under incredible pressure and then
 had to succeed in a new way having failed the first time which is like evena weirder and stranger store has an


Speaker 1 :incredible story in some sense but I
 mean a you I'm trying to get a sense of the kind of stress I think this is okay

Speaker 0 :but I'm rejecting what I don't think
 people understand with me is the scale of the critique it's like I don't youpeople say well you must implicitly
 agree with this and implicitly agree it's like now try me ask before you youdecide that I am mostly an agreement
 with the community about how these things should be handled or what thesethings mean keo keo


Speaker 1 :and also just why this criticism matter
 so much here so you seem to dislike the burden of criticism that it will chokeaway all a lot of different kinds of


Speaker 0 :criticism there's constructive criticism
 and there's destructive criticism and what I don't like is I don't like acommunity that can't first of all like
 if you take the physics community just the way we screwed up on masks in PPEjust the way we screw it up in the
 financial crisis and mortgage-backed securities we screw it up on stringtheory can we just forget the string


Speaker 1 :theory happened or sure but let if


Speaker 0 :somebody should say that right somebody
 should say you know it didn't work out

Speaker 1 :yeah but okay but you're asking this


Speaker 0 :like why do you guys get to keep the
 prestige after failing for 35 years that's an interesting point you guys

Speaker 1 :because to me where the profession look


Speaker 0 :these things if there is a theory of
 everything to be had right it's going to be a relatively small group of peoplewhere this will be sorted out
 absolutely it's it's it's not tens of thousands it's probably hundreds at thetop but within that within that


Speaker 1 :community there's the [ __ ] mm-hmm


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :there's the I mean you have you always
 in this world have people who are kind

Speaker 0 :open my mind is it's a question about
 okay let's imagine for example that you have a story where you believe thatulcers are definitely caused by stress
 and you've never questioned it or maybe you felt like the Japanese came out ofthe blue and attacked us at Pearl Harbor
 right and now somebody introduces a new idea to you which is like what if itisn't stress at all
 or what if we actually tried to make resource start of Japan attack ussomewhere in the Pacific so we could
 have cast a spell I to enter the Asian theater in persons original ideas likewhat what do you even say you know it's
 like two crazy well when Dirac in 1963talked about the importance of beauty as
 a guiding principle in physics and he wasn't talking about the scientificmethod that was crazy talk but he was
 actually making a great point and he was using Schrodinger and I think it wasSchrodinger was standing in for him and
 he said that if your equations don't agree with experiment that's kind of aminor detail if they have true beauty in
 them you should explore them because very often the agreement with experimentis that it's an issue of fine tuning of
 your model of the instantiation and so it doesn't really tell you thatyour model is wrong and of course
 Heisenberg told Dirac that his model was wrong because that the proton and theelectron should be the same mass if they
 are each other's antiparticles and that was a an irrelevant kind of sillinessrather than a real threat to the Dirac


Speaker 1 :theory but okay so I'm amidst all this
 silliness hmm I'm hoping that we could talk about the journey that geometricunity has taken and will take as an idea
 and an idea that will see the light yeah

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :that so first of all let's I'm thinking
 of writing a book called geometric unity for idiots okay and I need you as aconsultant


Speaker 0 :so can we first of all I hope I have the
 trademark on geometric units you do good

Speaker 1 :can you give a basic introduction of the
 goals of geometric unity the basic tools of mathematics use the viewpoints in

Speaker 0 :general for idiots Sharik me okay great


Speaker 1 :fun so what's the goal of geometric


Speaker 0 :unity the goal of geometric unity is to
 start with something so completely bland that you can simply say well that's asomething that begins the game is as
 close to a mathematical nothing as possible in other words I can't answerthe question why is there something
 rather than nothing but if there has to be a something that we begin from let itbegin from something that's like a blank


Speaker 1 :canvas that's even more basic so what is
 something what are we trying to describe

Speaker 0 :okay right now we have
 a model of our world and it's got two sectors one of the sector's is calledgeneral relativity and the other is
 called the standard model so we'll call it gr for general relativity and SM for

Speaker 1 :standard model what's the difference you
 need to what did the two describe so

Speaker 0 :general relativity gives pride of place
 to gravity and everything else is acting is a sort of a backup singer gravity is

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the star of the show gravity is the star
 of general relativity and in the standard model the other threenon-gravitational forces so if there are
 four forces that we know about three of the four non-gravitational that's wherethey get to shine great so tiny little


Speaker 1 :particles and how they interact with


Speaker 0 :each other so photons gluons and
 so-called intermediate vector bosons those are the things that the standardmodel showcases and general relativity
 showcases gravity and then you have matter which is accommodated in boththeories but much more beautifully
 inside of the standard model so what

Speaker 1 :what is a theory of everything do so


Speaker 0 :about that so first of all I think that
 that's that that's the first place where we haven't talked enough we assume thatwe know what it means but we don't
 actually have any idea what it means and what I claim it is is that it's a theorywhere the questions beyond that theory
 are no longer of a mathematical nature in other words if I say let us take X tobe a four dimensional manifold to a
 mathematician or physicist I've said very little I've simply said there'ssome place for calculus and linear
 algebra to to dance together and to play and that's what manifolds are they'rethe most natural place where that where
 our two greatest math theories can really intertwine which are that you own

Speaker 1 :the tacos the linear algebra


Speaker 0 :okay now the question is beyond that so
 it's sort of like saying I'm an artist and I want to order a canvas now thequestion is does the canvas paint itself
 does the can't does the canvas come up with an artist and an in paint in inkwhich then paint the canvas like that's
 the that's the hard part about theories of everything which I don't think people

Speaker 1 :talk enough about okay can we just you
 bring up a sure and then to hand the draws itself is a the fire that lights

Speaker 0 :itself or drawing hands the drawing


Speaker 1 :hands yeah and every time I start to
 think about that my mind like shuts down no don't do that it there's a spark and

Speaker 0 :this is the most beautiful part we know


Speaker 1 :it's beautiful but this robots brain
 sparks fly so can we try to say the same thing over and over in different waysabout what what would he mean by that
 having to be a thing we have to contend with sure like why why do you think thatunderstand creating a theory of
 everything as you call the source code our understanding our source coderequire a view like the hand that draws


Speaker 0 :itself okay well here's what goes on in
 the regular physics picture we've got these two main theories generalrelativity and the standard model right
 think of general relativity as more or less the theory of the canvas okay maybeyou you have the canvas in a
 particularly rigid shape maybe you've measured it so it's got length and it'sgot an angle but more or less it's just
 canvas and length and angle and that's all that there's really generalrelativity is but it allows the canvas
 to warp a bit then we have the second thing which is this import of foreignlibraries where it which aren't tied to
 space and time so we've got this crazy set of symmetries called su 3 cross su 2cross u 1
 we've got this collection of 16 particles in a generation which arethese sort of twisted spinners and we've
 got three copies of them then we've got this weird Higgs field that comes in andlike deus ex machina solves all the
 problems that have been created in the play that can't be resolved otherwise

Speaker 1 :that's the standard model of quantum
 field theory just plopped on top yes

Speaker 0 :it's a problem of the the double origin
 story one origin story is about space and time the other origin story is aboutwhat we would call internal quantum
 numbers and internal symmetries and then there was an attempt to get one tofollow from the other called Kaluza
 klein theory which didn't work out and this is sort of in that vein

Speaker 1 :so you said origins story so in the hand
 that draws itself what is it so it's

Speaker 0 :it's as if you had the canvas and then
 you ordered up also give me paint brushes paints pigments pencils and

Speaker 1 :artists but you're saying that's [ __ ]
 like if you want to create a universe from scratch the canvas should begenerating the paintbrushes and the
 paintbrush and they are turning the

Speaker 0 :canvas yeah yeah right like usually


Speaker 1 :who's the artist in this analogy well


Speaker 0 :this is sorry then we're gonna get to do
 a religious thing I don't wanna do that okay well you know my shtick which isthat we are the AI we have two great
 stories about the simulation and artificial general intelligence in onestory man fears that some program we've
 given birth to will become self-aware smarter than us and will take over inanother story there are genius
 simulators and we live in their simulation and we haven't realized thatthose two stories are the same story in
 one case we are the simulator and another case we are the simulated and ifyou buy those and you put them together
 we are the AGI and whether or not we have simulators we may be trying to wakeup by learning our own source code so
 this could be our Skynet moment which is one of the reasons I have some issuesaround it


Speaker 1 :I think we'll talk about that because I


Speaker 0 :well that's the issue of the emergent
 artists within the story yeah just to get back to the point okay so so now thekey point is the standard way we tell
 the story is is that Einstein sets the canvas and then we order all the stuffthat we want and then that paints the
 picture that is our universe so you order the the paint you order the artistyou order the brushes and that then when
 you collide the two gives you two separate origin stories the canvas camefrom one place and everything else came
 from somewhere else so what are the

Speaker 1 :mathematical tools required to to
 construct consistent geometric theory

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you know make this concrete well somehow


Speaker 0 :you need to get three copies for example
 of generations with 16 particles each right and so the question would be likewell there's a lot there's a lot of
 special personality in those symmetries where would they come from so forexample you've got what would be called
 grand unified theories that sound like su5 the Georgia a theory there'ssomething that should be called spin ten
 but physicists insist on calling it s o ten there's something called the petitSalam theory that tends to be called su
 4 across su 2 cross su 2 which should be called spin six crust spin four I canget into all of these but what are they


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :all accomplishing they're all taking the
 known forces that we see and packaging them up to say we can't get rid of thesecond origin story but we can at least
 make that origin story more unified so they're trying-- grand unification isthe attempt that's a mistake in your in


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :you've got a mistake that the problem is
 it was born lifeless when when Georgia and glasha first came out with the su5theory it was very exciting because it
 could be tested in a South Dakota mind filled up with likecleaning fluid or something like that
 and they look for proton decay and didn't see it and then they gave upbecause in in that day when your
 experiment didn't work you gave up on the theory it didn't come to us born ofa fusion between Einstein and and and
 Bohr you know and that was kind of the problem is it had this weird parentingwhere it was just on the Bohr side there
 was no Einstein Ian's contribution Lex how can I help you mostI'm right here what questions you want
 to ask so that the most satisfying

Speaker 1 :answers there's there's a there's a
 bunch there's a bunch of questions I want to ask I mean one and I'm trying tosneak up on you somehow to reveal in an
 accessible way then the nature of our

Speaker 0 :universe so I can just give you a guess
 right like I we have to be very careful thatwe're not claiming that this has been
 accepted this is a speculation but I will I will make the speculation thatwhat I think what you would want to ask
 me is how can the canvas generate all the stuff that usually has to be orderedseparately all right should we do that


Speaker 1 :let's go there okay so the first thing


Speaker 0 :is is that you have a concept in
 computers called technical debt you're coding and you cut corners and you knowyou're gonna have to do it right before
 the thing is safe for the world but you're piling up some series of i/o usedto yourself and your project as you're
 going along so the first thing is we can't figure out if you have only fourdegrees of freedom and that's what your
 canvas is how do you get at least in Stan's world Einstein says look it's notjust four degrees of freedom but there
 need to be rulers and protractors to measure length and angle in the worldyou can't just have a flabby four
 degrees of freedom so the first thing you do is you create ten extra variableswhich is like if we can't choose any
 particular set of rulers and protractors to measure length and angle let's takethe the set of all possible rulers and
 protractors and that would be called symmetric non-degenerate two tensors onthe tangent space of the four manifold X
 for now because there are four degrees of freedom you start off with fourdimensions then you need four rulers for
 each of those different directions so that's four that gets us up to eightvariables and then between four original
 variables there are six possible angles so four plus four plus six is equal to14
 so now you've replaced x4 with another space which in the lecture I think Icalled you 14 but are now calling Y 14
 is one of the big problems of working on something in private is every time youpull it out you sort of can't remember
 it you name something something new okay so you've got a fourteen dimensionalworld which is the original four
 dimensional world plus a lot of extra gadgetry for measurement and because

Speaker 1 :you're not in the four dimensional world
 you don't have the technical debt is no

Speaker 0 :now you've got a lot of technical debt
 because now you have to explain away a fourteen dimensional world which is abig you're taking a huge advance on your
 pay day check alright but aren't more

Speaker 1 :dimensions allow you more freedom says I


Speaker 0 :mean maybe but you have to get rid of
 them somehow because we don't perceive them so eventually have to collapse it

Speaker 1 :down to the thing that we perceive or


Speaker 0 :you have to sample a four dimensional
 filament within that fourteen dimensional world known as the section

Speaker 1 :of a bundle ok so how do we get from the
 fourteen dimensional world where I imagine a lot of folate yeah you're

Speaker 0 :cheating the first question was how do
 we get something from almost nothing like how do we get the if I've said thatthe who and the what in the newspaper
 story that is a theory of everything are bosons and fermions so let's make thewho the fermions and the what the bosons
 think of as the players and the equipment for a game are we supposed to

Speaker 1 :be thinking of actual physical things
 with mass or energy okay so they think

Speaker 0 :about everything you see in this room so
 from chemistry you know it's all protons neutrons and electrons but from a littlebit of not late 1960s physics we know
 that the protons and neutrons are all of up quarks and down quarks soeverything in this room is basically up
 quarks down quarks and electrons stuck together with with the the what theequipment okay now the way we see it
 currently is we see that there are space-time indices which we would callspinners that correspond to the whoo
 that is the fermions the matter the stuff the up quarks the down quarks theelectrons and there are also 16 degrees
 of freedom that come from this in the space of internal quantum numbers so inmy theory in fourteen dimensions there's
 no internal quantum number space that figures in it's all just spin oreal sospinners in fourteen dimensions without
 any festooning with extra linear algebraic information there's a conceptof a of spinners which is natural if you
 have a manifold with length and angle and y 14 is almost a manifold withlength and angle it's it's so close it's
 in other words because you're looking at the space of all rulers and protractorsmaybe it's not that surprising that a
 space of rulers and protractors might come very close to having rulers andprotractors on it itself like can you
 measure the space of measurements and you almost can and in a space that haslength and angle if it doesn't have a
 topological obstruction comes with these objects called spinners now the spinnersare the stuff of of our world we are
 made of spinners they're the most important really deep object that I cantell you about they were very surprising
 what is this spinner so famously there are these weird things that require 720degrees of rotation in order to come
 back to normal and that doesn't make sense and be the reason for this is thatthere's a knotted miss in our
 three-dimensional world that people don't observe and then you know you canfamously see it by this Dirac string
 trick so if you take a glass of water imagine that this was a tumbler and Ididn't want to spill any of it and the
 question is if I rotate the cup without losing my grip on the base 360 degreesand I can't go backwards is there any
 way I can take a sip and the answer is this weird motion which is go over firstand under second and that that's 720
 degrees of rotation to come back to normal so that I can take a setwell that weird principle which
 sometimes is known as the Philippine wineglass dance because waitresses inthe Philippines apparently learned how
 to do this that that move defines if you will this hidden space that nobody knewwas there of spinors which Dirac figured
 out when he took the square root of something called the klein-gordonequation which I think had earlier work
 incorporated from carton and killing in company in mathematics so the spinnersare one of the most profound aspects of
 human existence and you forgive me for

Speaker 1 :the perhaps dumb questions but what a
 spinner be the mathematical objects that's the basic unit of our universe

Speaker 0 :when you when you start with a manifold
 which is just like something like a doughnut or a sphere circle or a Mobiusband a spinner is usually the first
 wildly surprising thing that you found was hidden in your original purchase soyou you order a manifold and you didn't
 even realize it's like buying a house and finding a panic room inside that youhadn't counted on it's very surprising
 when you understand that spinners are running around on your spaces again

Speaker 1 :perhaps a dumb question but we're
 talking about 14 dimensions and four dimensionswhat is the manifold or operating under


Speaker 0 :in my case it's proto space
 it's before it's before Einstein can slap rulers and protractors on spacetime and what you mean by that sorry to


Speaker 1 :interrupt is space time is the 4d
 manifold space-time is a four

Speaker 0 :dimensional manifold with extra
 structure most the extra structure it's

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :called a semi Romanian or pseudo Romani
 and metric in in essence there is something akin to a four by foursymmetric matrix from which is
 equivalent to length and angle so when I talk about rulers and protractors or Italk about length and angle or I talk
 about romani and or pseudo Romani and or semi Romani and met manifolds I'musually talking about the same thing can
 you measure how long something is and what the angle is between two differentrays or vectors so that's what Einstein
 gave us as his arena his place to play his his canvas so there's a bunch of

Speaker 1 :questions I can ask here but like I said
 I'm working on this book geometric unity for he it's and I think what would bereally nice as your editor to have like
 beautiful maybe even visualizations that people could try to play with try to tryto reveal small little beauties about
 the way you're thinking about the

Speaker 0 :squirrel I'll usually use the Joe Rogan
 program for that sometimes I have him doing the Philippine wine glass danceI had the hopf fibration the part of the
 problem is is that most people don't know this language about spinnersbundles metrics gauge fields and they're
 very curious about the theory of everything but they have nounderstanding of even what we know about
 our own world is it hole is it a

Speaker 1 :hopeless pursuit so like even gauge
 theory right just this I mean it seems to be very inaccessible is there someaspect of it that could be made
 accessible I'm actually go to the board

Speaker 0 :right there and give you a five minute
 lecture on engaged theory that would be better than the official lecture engagedthere you would know what gauge there
 was so it is it's possible to make it

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :accessible yeah but nobody does like in
 other words you're gonna watch over the next year lots of different discussionsof a quantum entanglement or you know
 the multiverse where are we now right or you know many worlds are theyall equally real yeah did that right I


Speaker 1 :mean yeah that that's it but you're not


Speaker 0 :gonna hear anything about the hopf
 fibration except if it's from me and I

Speaker 1 :hate that why why can't you be the one


Speaker 0 :but because I'm going a different path I
 think that we've made a huge mistake which is we have things we can showpeople about the actual models we can
 push out visualizations where they they're not listening my analogy they'rewatching the same thing that we're
 seeing and as I've said to you before this is like choosing to perform sheetmusic that hasn't been performed in a
 long time or you know the experts can't afford orchestras so they just tradeBeethoven symphonies and as sheet music
 and they oh wow that was beautiful but it's like nobody heard anything theyjust looked at the score well that's how
 mathematicians and physicists trade papers and ideas is that they they writedown the things that represent stuff I
 want to at least close out the thought line that you started yes which is howdoes the canvas order all of this other
 stuff into being so I at least like I say some incomprehensible things aboutthat and then we'll we'll have that much
 done all right and that just point does

Speaker 1 :it have to be incomprehensible do you


Speaker 0 :know what the Schrodinger equation is
 yes do you know what the Dirac equation is what does know mean well my point is

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :you're gonna have some feeling that you
 know what the Schrodinger equation yes as soon as we get to the Dirac equationyour eyes are gonna get a little bit
 glazed right so now why is that well the answer to me this is that you you wantto ask me about the theory of everything
 but you haven't even digest the theory of everything as we've had it since 1928when Dirac came out with his equation
 so for whatever reason and this isn't a hit on you yeahyou haven't been motivated enough in all
 the time that you've been on earth to at least get as far as the Dirac equationand this was very interesting to me
 after I gave the talk in Oxford New Scientist who'd done kind of a hatchetjob on me to begin with sent a reporter
 to come to the third version of the talk that I gave and that person had neverheard of the Dirac equation so you have
 a person who was completely professionally not qualified to askthese questions wanting to know well how
 does how does your theory solve new problems like well in the case of theDirac equation well tell me about that I
 don't know what that is so then the point is okay I got ityou're not even caught up minimally to
 where we are now and that's not a knock on you almost nobody is yeah but howdoes it become my job to digest what has
 been available for like over 90 years

Speaker 1 :well to me the open question is whether
 what's been available for over 90 years can be there could be a a blueprint of ajourney that one takes to understand it
 not oh I want to do that with you and I

Speaker 0 :I one of the things I think I've been
 relatively successful at for example you know when you ask other people whatgauge theory is you get these very
 confusing responses and my response is much simpler it's oh it's a theory ofdifferentiation where when you calculate
 the instantaneous rise over run you measure the rise not from a flathorizontal but from a custom endogenous
 reference level what do you mean by that it's like okay and then I do this thingwith Mount Everest which is man Everest
 is how high then they give the height I say above what then they say sea leveland I say which sea is that in Nepal
 like oh I guess there isn't a sea cuz it's landlocked it's like okay well whatdo you mean by sea level oh there's this
 thing called the geoid I'd never heard of oh that's the reference level it's acustom reference level that we imported
 so you all sorts of people have remembered the exact height of MountEverest without ever knowing what it's a
 height from well in this case in gauge Theory there's a hidden reference levelwhere you measure the rise in rise over
 run to give the slope of the line what if you have different concepts of whatof where that rise should be measured
 from that vary within the theory that are endogenous to the theory that's whatgauge theory is okay we have a video
 here right yeah okay I'm gonna use my phone if I want to measure my hand andits slope this is my attempt to measure
 it using standard calculus in other words the reference level is apparentlyflat and I measure the rise above that
 phone using my hand okay if I want to use gauge theory it means I can do thisor I can do that or I can do this or I
 can do this or I could do what I did from the beginning okay at some levelthat's what gauge theory is now that is
 an act no I've never heard anyone describe it that way so while thecommunity may say well who is this guy
 and why does he have the right to talk in public I'm waiting for somebody tojump out of the woodwork and say you
 know Eric's whole shtick about rulers and protractors leading to a derivativederivatives are measured as rise over
 run above a reference level of reference levels don't fit to get like I gothrough this whole shtick in order to
 make it accessible I've never heard anyone say it I'm trying to make thePrometheus would like to discuss fire
 with everybody else all right I'm gonna just say one thing to close out theearlier line which is what I think we
 should have continued with when you take the naturally occurring spinners theunadorned spinners the naked spinners
 not on this fourteen dimensional manifold but on something very closelytied to it which I've called the
 chimeric tangent bundle that is the the object which stands in for the thingthat should have had length and angle on
 Abbott just missed okay when you take that object and you formspinners on that and you don't adorn
 them so you're still in the single origin story you get very large spinoriole objects upstairs on this 14
 dimensional world y 14 which is part of the observers when you pull thatinformation back from y 14 down to X 4
 it miraculously looks like the adorned spinners the festooned spinners thespinners that we play with in ordinary
 reality in other words the 14 dimensional world looks like a fourdimensional world plus a 10 dimensional
 complement so 10 plus 4 equals 14 that 10 dimensional complement which iscalled a normal bundle generates spin
 properties internal quantum numbers that look like the things that give ourparticles personality then make let's
 say up quarks and down quarks charged by negative one-third or plus two thirdsyou know that kind of stuff or whether
 or not you know some quarks feel the weak force and other quarks do not sothe x4 generates Y 14 y 14 generates
 something called the chimeric tangent bundle chimeric tangent bundle generatesunadorned spinners the unadorned
 spinners get pulled back from 14 down to 4 where they look like adorned spinnersand we have the right number of them you
 thought you needed 3 you only got 2 but then something else that you've neverseen before broke apart on this journey
 and it broke into another copy of the thing that you already have two copiesof one piece of that thing broke off so
 now you have two generations plus an imposter third generation which is Idon't know why we never talked about
 this possibility in regular physics and then you've got a bunch of stuff that wehaven't seen which has descriptions so
 people always say does it make any falsifiable predictions yes it does itsays that the matter that you should be
 seeing next has particular properties that can be readlike like we guys to spend weak
 hypercharge like the responsiveness to the strong force the one I can't tellyou is what energy scale it would happen


Speaker 1 :it say you would if you can't say if
 those characteristics can be detected

Speaker 0 :with current it may be that somebody
 else can I'm not a physicist I'm not a quantum field theory I can't I I don'tknow how you would do that the the hope


Speaker 1 :for me is that there's some simple
 explanations for all of it Lex should we

Speaker 0 :have a drink you're having fun no I'm
 trying to have fun with you you know I

Speaker 1 :had there's a bunch of fun things to


Speaker 0 :talk about here anyway that was how I
 got what I thought you wanted which is if you think about the fermions as theartists and the bosons as the brushes
 and the paint what I told you is that's how we get the artists what are the open

Speaker 1 :questions for you in this what were the
 challenges so you're not done well

Speaker 0 :there's the things that I would like to
 have in better order so a lot of people will say see the reason I hesitated onthis is I just have a totally different
 view than the community so for example I believe that general relativity began in1913 with Einstein and Grossman now that
 was the first of like four major papers in this line of thinking to mostphysicists general relativity happened
 when Einstein produced a divergence free gradient which turned out to be thegradient of the so-called Hilbert or
 Einstein Hilbert action and from my perspective that wasn't true is is thatit began when Einstein said look this is
 about differential geometry and it's the final answer is going to look like acurvature tensor on one side and matter
 and energy on the other side and that was enough and then he published a wrongof it where it was the Ricci tensor not
 the Einstein tensor then he corrected the reach the Ricci tensor to make itinto the Einstein tensor then he
 corrected that to add a cosmological constant I can't stand that thecommunity thinks in those terms there's
 some things about which like that there's a question about whichcontraction do I use there's an Einstein
 contraction there's a Ricci contraction they both go between the same spaces I'mnot sure what I should do I'm not sure
 which contraction I should choose this is called a Shia operator forship-in-a-bottle and my stuff you have


Speaker 1 :this big platform in many ways that
 inspires people's curiosity about

Speaker 0 :physics yeah automatics right now and


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :I'm one of those people and great but


Speaker 1 :then you start using a lot of words that
 I don't understand and like I might know them but I don't understand and what'sunclear to me if I'm supposed to be
 listening to those words or if it's just if this is one of those technical thingsthat's intended for a very small
 community or if I'm supposed to actually take those words and start you know amulti-year study not not a serious study
 but a the kind of study when you you're interested in learning about machinelearning for example or any kind of
 discipline that's where I'm a little bit confused so you you speak beautifullyabout ideas you often reveal the beauty
 in Mathematica matauri and I'm unclear and what are the steps I should betaking I I'm curious
 how can I explore how can i play with something how can i play with theseideas well and and enjoy the beauty of
 not necessarily understanding the depth of a theory that you're presenting butstart to share in the beauty as opposed
 to sharing in and enjoying the beauty of just the way the passion with which youspeak which is in itself fun to listen
 to but also starting to be able to understand someaspects of this theory that I can enjoy
 it too and start to build an intuition what theheck we're even talking about because
 you're basically saying we need to throw a lot of our ideas of views of the

Speaker 0 :universe out and I'm trying to find


Speaker 1 :accessible ways in okay long not in this


Speaker 0 :conversation no I appreciate that
 so one of the things that I've done is I've picked on one paragraph from EdwardWitten and I said this is the paragraph
 if I could only take one paragraph with me this is the one I'd take and it'salmost all in prose not an equation and
 he says look this is this is our knowledge of the universe at its deepestlevel and he was writing this during the
 1980s and he has three separate points that constitute our deepest knowledgeand those three points refer to
 equations one to the Einstein field equation one to the Dirac equation andone to the yang-mills Maxwell equation
 now one thing I would do is take a look at that paragraph and say okay what dothese three lines mean like it's a
 finite amount of verbiage you can write down every word that you don't know youcan say what do I think
 done now young man yes there's a beautiful wall in Stoneybrook New Yorkbuilt by someone who I know you will
 interview named Jim silence and Jim silence and he's not the artist but he'sthe guy who funded an world's greatest
 hedge fund manager and on that wall contained the three equations thatWitten refers to in that paragraph and
 so that is the transmission from the paragraph or graph to the wall now thatwall needs an owner's manual which Roger
 Penrose has written called the road to reality let's call that the tome so thisis the subject of the so-called graph
 wall tome project that is going on in our discord server and our generalaround the portal community which is how
 do you take something that purports in one paragraph to say what the deepestunderstanding man has of the universe in
 which he lives it's memorialized on a wall which nobodyknows about which is an incredibly
 gorgeous piece of art and that was written up in a book which is has beenwritten for no man right
 maybe if maybe it's for a woman I don't know but no no one should be able toread this book because either you're a
 professional and you know a lot of this book in which case it's kind of arefreshers to see how Roger thinks about
 these things or you don't even know that this book is a self-contained invitationto understanding our deepest nature so I
 would say find yourself in the graph wall tome transmission sequence and jointhe graph wall tome project if that's of
 interest okay beautiful now just to

Speaker 1 :linger on a little longer what kind of
 journey do you see geometric unity taking I don't know I mean that's the

Speaker 0 :thing is that first of all the
 professional community has to get very angry and outraged and they have to workthrough their feelings this is nonsense
 this is [ __ ] or like no wait a minute this is really cool actually Ineed some clarification over here so
 there's going to be some sort of weird coming back together process are you

Speaker 1 :already hearing murmurings of that it


Speaker 0 :was very funny officially I've seen very


Speaker 1 :little so it's perhaps happening quietly


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah you often talk about we need to get


Speaker 0 :off this planet yep can I try to sneak


Speaker 1 :up on that by asking what in your kind
 of view is the difference the gap between the science of it theory and theactual engineering of building something
 that leverages the theory to do something like how big is that we don't

Speaker 0 :know gap I mean if you have ten extra
 dimensions to play with that are the rulers and protractors of the worldthemselves can you gain access to those
 dimensions do you have a hunch so I

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :don't know I don't want to get ahead of
 myself because the you have to appreciate I can have hunches and I canI can jaw off but one of the ways that
 I'm succeeding in this world is to not bow down to my professional communitiesnor to ignore them
 like I'm actually interested in the criticism I just wanted denature it sothat it's not personally interpersonal
 and irrelevant I believe that they don't want me to speculate and I don't need tospeculate about this I can centrally say
 I'm open to the idea that it may have engineering prospects and it may be adeath sentence we may find out that
 there's not enough new here that even if it were right that there would benothing new to do
 can't tell you that's what you mean by

Speaker 1 :death sentences there would not be


Speaker 0 :exciting breakthrough terrible if you
 couldn't like you can do new things in an Einsteinian world that you couldn'tdo in a Newtonian world right you know
 like you have twin paradoxes or Lorentz contraction of length or any one of anumber of new cool things happen in
 relativity theory that didn't happen for Newton what if there wasn't new stuff todo at the next and final level so that


Speaker 1 :would be quite sad let me ask a silly
 question but we'll say it with a

Speaker 0 :straight face impossible so let me


Speaker 1 :mention Elon Musk what are your thoughts
 about he's more you're more on the physics theory side of things he's morein the physics engineering side of
 things in terms of SpaceX efforts what do you think of his efforts to uh get

Speaker 0 :off this planet well I think he's the
 other guy who's sent me serious about getting off this planet I think they'retwo of us were semi serious about
 getting off the planet what do you think

Speaker 1 :about his methodology and yours when you
 look at them don't and I don't be

Speaker 0 :against you because like I was so
 excited that like your top video was reycarts file and then I did yourpodcast and we had some chemistry so
 it's oom DUP yeah and I thought okay I'm gonna betray curse sauce so just as I'mcoming up on Ray Kurzweil
 like and now Alex Friedman special Elon Musk and he blew me out of the water soI don't want to be petty about it I want
 to say that I don't could I am yeah okay because the funny part he's not takingenough risk like he's trying to get us
 to Mars imagine that he got us to Mars the moon and we'll throw in Titan andknow we're good enough the
 diversification level is too low now there's a compatibility first of all Idon't think he Lana's serious is about
 Mars I think Elon is using Mars as a

Speaker 1 :narrative as a stories and to make the


Speaker 0 :moon jealous it makes it I think he's
 using it as a story to organize us to reacquaint ourselves with our need forspace our need to get off this planet
 it's a concrete thing he's shown that many people think that he's shown thathe's the most brilliant and capable
 person on the planet I don't think that's what he showed I think he showedthat the rest of us have forgotten our
 capabilities so he's like the only guy who has still kept the faith and is likewhat's wrong with you people


Speaker 1 :so you think the lesson we should draw
 from Elon Musk is there's a is a capable person within within a lot of us you on

Speaker 0 :make sense to me
 in what way he's doing what any sensible person should do he's trying incrediblethings and he's partially succeeding
 partially failing to try to solve the

Speaker 1 :obvious problems before uh yeah you know


Speaker 0 :but he comes up with things like you
 know I got it we'll come up with a battery company but batteries aren'tsexy so well we'll make a car around it
 like great you know or any one of a number of thingsElon is behaving like a same person and
 I view everyone else's insane and my feeling is is that we really have to getoff this planet we have to get out of
 this we have to get out of the neighborhood tilling I know a little bit

Speaker 1 :do you think that's a physics problem or
 an engineering problem

Speaker 0 :he's a cowardice problem I think that
 we're afraid that we had 400 hitters of the mind likeEinstein in Dirac and that that era is
 done and now we're just sort of copy

Speaker 1 :editors so some of it money like if we
 become brave enough yeah go outside the solar system can we afford tofinancially well I think that's not


Speaker 0 :really the issue the issue is look what
 Elon did well he amassed a lot of money and then he you know he plowed it backin and he spun
 he spun the wheel and he made more money and now he's got fu money now theproblem is is that a lot of the people
 who have fu money are not people whose middle finger you ever want to see Iwant to see you Long's middle finger I
 want to see what I mean by that or like

Speaker 1 :when you say [ __ ] it I'm gonna do the


Speaker 0 :biggest go see whatever the [ __ ] you
 want Yeah right [ __ ] you [ __ ] anything that gets in his way that he can affordto push out of his way and you're saying


Speaker 1 :he's not actually even doing that enough
 no I mean he's not going please I want

Speaker 0 :to go
 Elon is doing fine with his money I just want him to enjoy himself have the mostyou know die nice you know but you're


Speaker 1 :saying Mars is playing it safe he


Speaker 0 :doesn't know how to do anything else
 he knows rockets yeah and he might know some physics at a fundamental level yeah

Speaker 1 :I guess okay just let me just like go
 right back to you how much physics do you really how much brilliantbreakthrough ideas on the physics side
 do you need to get off this planet I

Speaker 0 :don't know and I don't know whether like
 in my most optimistic dream I don't know whether my stuff gets us off the planetbut it's hope it's hope that there's a
 more fundamental theory that we can access that we don't need you know whoseelegance and beauty will suggest that
 this is probably the way the universe goes like you have to say this weirdthing which is this I believe and this I
 believe is a very dangerous statement but this I believe I believe that mytheory
 points the way now Elon might or might not be able to access my theory I don'tknow I don't know what he knows but keep
 in mind why are we all so focused on you on it's really weirdit's kind of creepy to what he's just a


Speaker 1 :person who's just asking the the obvious
 questions and doing whatever he can but

Speaker 0 :he makes sense to me
 you sent craig venter makes sense to me Jim Watson makes sense to me but we're

Speaker 1 :focusing on Elon because he's he somehow


Speaker 0 :is rare well that's the weird thing like
 we've come up with a system that eliminates all Elon from our pipelineand Elon somehow snuck through when they
 were quality adjusting everything you

Speaker 1 :know and this this idea of of disk I
 distributed idea suppression complex yeah is that what's bringing the in-lawsof the world down you know so funny it's


Speaker 0 :like he's asking Joe Rogan like is that
 a joint you know it's like well what will happen if I smoke it what willhappen to the stock price what will
 happen if I scratch myself in public what will happen if I say what I thinkabout Thailand or kovat or who knows
 what and everybody's like don't say that say this go do this go do that well it'scrazy-making it's absolutely crazy
 making and if you think about what we put through people through we need toget people who can use fu money the fu
 money they need to insulate themselves from all of the people who know betterbecause the my nightmare is is that why
 did we only get one ilan what if we were supposed to have thousands and thousandsof yuan and the weird thing is like this
 is all that remains you're looking at like obi-wan and Yodaand it's like this is the only this is
 all that's left after X order 66 has been executed and that's the thingthat's really upsetting to me is we used
 we used to have Ilan's five deep and then we could talk about Elon in thecontext of his cohort but this is like
 if you were to see a raph in the Arctic with no trees aroundyou'd think why the long neck what a
 strange sight you know how do we get

Speaker 1 :more lawns how do we change these so I
 think the useful so we know MIT yeah and Harvard so can maybe returning to ourprevious conversation my sense is that
 the Ilan's of the world are supposed to come from MIT in Harvard right and howdo you change let's think of one that


Speaker 0 :MIT sort of killed have any names in
 mind Aaron Schwartz leaps to my mind yeah okay are we MIT supposed to shieldthe Aaron Schwartz's from I don't know
 journal publishers or are we supposed to help the journal publishers so that wecan throw 35 year sentences in his face
 or whatever it is that we did that depressed him okay so here's my pointyeah I want MIT to go back to being the
 home of Aaron Schwartz and if you want to send Aaron Schwartz to a state wherehe's looking at 35 years in prison or
 something like that you are my sworn enemyyou are not MIT yeah you are the
 traitorous irresponsible middlebrow pencil-pushing green eyeshade fool thatneeds to not be in the seat at the
 presidency of MIT period the end get the [ __ ] out of there and let one of ourpeople sit in that chair and think that


Speaker 1 :you've articulated is that the people in
 those chairs are not the way they are because they're evil or somehow morallycompromised is that it's just that
 that's the distributed nature is that there's some kind of aspect of thesystem there's people who width emselves


Speaker 0 :to the system they adapt every instinct
 and the fact is is that they're not going to be on Joe Rogan smoking a blunt

Speaker 1 :that let me ask a silly question do you
 think institutions generally just tend

Speaker 0 :to become that no we get some of the
 institution we get Caltech here's what we'resupposed to have we're supposed to have
 Caltech we're supposed to have a read we're supposed to have Deep Springswe're supposed to have MIT we're
 supposed to have a part of Harvard and when the sharp elbow crowd comes afterthe Scheldt sharp mine crowd we're
 supposed to break those sharp elbows and say don't come around here again so what

Speaker 1 :are the weapons that the sharp mines are
 supposed to use in our modern day so to reclaim MIT what is the what's thefuture are you kidding me


Speaker 0 :first of all assume that this is being
 seen at MIT

Speaker 1 :hey everybody is OK hey everybody try to


Speaker 0 :remember who you are you're the guys who
 put the police car on top of the great dump you you guys came up with the greatbreasts of knowledge you created a
 Tetris game in the green building now what is your problem they killed one ofyour own you should make their life a
 living hell you should be the ones who keep themayor memory of Aaron Schwartz alive and
 all of those hackers and all of those mutants you know it's like it's eitherour place or it isn't and if we have to
 throw 12 more pianos off of the roof right if Harold Edgerton is taking thosephotographs you know with slow-mo back
 in the 40s if Noam Chomsky's on your faculty whatthe hell is wrong with you kids you are
 the most creative and insightful people and you can't figure out how to defendAaron Schwartz that's on you guys so


Speaker 1 :some of that is giving more power to the
 young like you said you know it's a

Speaker 0 :brazing towel rub taking power from the
 feeble and the middle Brown yeah but how

Speaker 1 :do you what is the mechanism to me I
 don't know you you have some 9-volt

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :batteries no copper wire I attend to you


Speaker 0 :have a capacitor I tend to believe you


Speaker 1 :have to create an alternative and make
 the alternative so much better that it makes MIT obsolete unless they changeand that's what forces change so
 supposed took somehow okay so use

Speaker 0 :projection mapping most projection


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :mapping where you take some complicated
 edifice and you map all of its planes and then you actually project someunbelievable graphics rescanning a
 building let's say at night say okay so you want to do some graffiti art withyou basically want to hack the system


Speaker 1 :know when I say look listen to me Lee


Speaker 0 :yeah we're smarter than they are and
 they you know what they say they say things like I think we need some geeksget me two PhDs
 right you treat phd's like that that's a bad move PhDs are capable and we actlike our job is to peel grapes for our


Speaker 1 :betters yeah that this is strange thing
 and I you speak about it very eloquently is how we treat basically the greatestminds in the world which is like at at
 their prime which is PhD students like that we pay them nothing we I'm donewith it


Speaker 0 :yeah right we gotta take what's ours so
 it so yeah take back MIT become uncover nerble become uncover noble and by theway when you become uncover nerble don't
 do it by throwing food don't do it by pouring salt on the lawn like a jerk doit through brilliance because what you
 Caltech and MIT can do and maybe Rensselaer Polytechnic or Woosterpolitic I don't know Lehigh
 goddamnit what's wrong with you technical people you act like you're aservant class it's unclear to me how you


Speaker 1 :reclaim it except with brilliance like
 you said but to me that the way you were claimed it was brilliant Segal system

Speaker 0 :Aaron Schwartz came from the Elon Musk
 class what you guys gonna do about it right if super capable people need toflex need to be individual they need to
 stop giving away all their power to you know is like Geist or a community orthis or that you're not you're not
 indoor cats your outdoor cats go be outdoor cat do you think we're gonna see

Speaker 1 :this this kind of asking me you know


Speaker 0 :before like what about the World War two
 generation right when I'm trying to say is thatthere's a technical revolt coming here's
 you weren't talking about that I'm trying to lead it yeah I'm trying to seeno you're not trying a lot you're trying


Speaker 1 :to get a blueprint here all right Lex


Speaker 0 :yeah how angry are you about our country
 pretending that you and I can't actually do technical subjects so that they needan army of kids coming in from four
 countries in Asia it's not about the four countries in Asia it's not aboutthose kids
 it's about lying about us that we don't care enough about science and technologythat we're incapable of it as if we
 don't have Chinese and Russians and Koreans and Croatians like we've goteverybody here the only reason you're
 looking outside is is that you want to hire cheap people from the familybusiness because you don't want to pass
 the family business on and you know what you didn't really build the familybusiness it's not yours to decide you
 the boomers and you the Silent Generation you did your bit but you alsofollowed a lot of stuff up and your
 custodians you are caretakers you were supposed to hand something what you didinstead was to gorge yourself on cheap
 foreign labor but you then held up as being much more brilliant than your ownchildren which was never true but I'm


Speaker 1 :trying to understand how we create a
 better system without anger without revolution no not not by kissing andhugs and and but by I mean I don't
 understand within MIT what the mechanism of building a better MIT is we're not

Speaker 0 :gonna pay Elsevier Aaron Schwartz was
 right JSTOR is an abomination

Speaker 1 :but why who would then MIT who within
 institutions is going to do that when just like you said the people who arerunning the show are more senior and if


Speaker 0 :Frank will check to speak out so year is


Speaker 1 :basically individuals that step up I
 mean one of the surprising things about Elon is that one person can inspire somuch


Speaker 0 :he's got academic freedom it just comes


Speaker 1 :from money I don't agree with that do
 you think money okay so yes certainly

Speaker 0 :sorry an testicle you yes but those are


Speaker 1 :more important than money right or guts
 I I think I do agree with you you speak about this a lot that because the moneyin the academic institutions has been so
 constrained that people are misbehaving in in in horrible yes but I don't thinkthat if we reverse that and give a huge
 amount of money people will also behave well I think it also takes guts so you

Speaker 0 :need to give people security security
 yeah like you need to know there you have a job yeah on Monday when on Fridayyou say I'm not so sure I really love
 diversity and inclusion and somebody's looking wait what you didn't lovediverse we had a statement on diversity
 and you wouldn't sign are you against the inclusion part or are you againstdiverse do you just not like people like
 you like actually that has nothing to do with anything you're making this intosomething that it isn't I don't want to
 sign your goddamn stupid statement and get out of my lab right get out of mylab it all begins from the middle finger
 get out of my lab the administrators need to find other work yeah listen I

Speaker 1 :agree with you and I I hope to seek your
 advice and and wisdom as we change this because I'd love to see I will visit you

Speaker 0 :in prison if that's what you're asking


Speaker 1 :I have no I think prison is great you
 get a lot of reading done and then when good working out well let me ask thesomething I brought up before is the
 Nietzsche quote of beware that when fighting monsters you yourself donot become a monster for when you gaze
 long into the abyss the abyss gazes into you are you worried that your focus onthe flaws in the system that we've just
 been talking about has damaged your mind or the part of the mind of your mindthat's able to see the beauty in the
 world in the system that because you have so sharply been able to see theflaws in the system you can no longer
 step back and appreciate it speeding

Speaker 0 :look I'm the one who's trying to get the
 institutions to save themselves by getting rid ofinhabitants believing the institution
 like a neutron bomb that removes the unworkable leadership class but leavesthe structures so I equals so the


Speaker 1 :leadership classes really the problem
 the leadership class is that the

Speaker 0 :individual like the professor's Dean


Speaker 1 :video scholar the professor's are gonna


Speaker 0 :have to go back into training to
 remember how to be professors like people are cowards at the moment becauseif they're not cowards they're
 unemployed yeah

Speaker 1 :that's one of the disappointing things
 I've encountered is to me tenure they

Speaker 0 :don't nobody has tenure now why whether


Speaker 1 :they do or not they certainly don't have


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :character not the kind of character and
 fortitude that I was hoping to see to me

Speaker 0 :but they'd be gone but see you're
 dreaming about the people who used to live at MIT you're dreaming about theprevious inhabitants of your university
 and if you looked at somebody like you know isadora singer is very old I don'tknow what state he's in but that guy was
 absolutely the real deal and if you look at Noam Chomsky tell me that NoamChomsky has been muzzled right yeah now
 what I'm trying to get at is you're talking about younger energetic peoplebut those people like when I say
 something like I'm against I'm for word inclusion and I'm for diversity but I'magainst diversity and inclusion TM like
 the movement well I couldn't say that if I was a professor oh my god he's againstour sacred document okay well in that
 kind of a world do you want to know how many things I don't agree with you on itlike we could go on for days and days
 and days all of the nonsense that you've parroted inside of the institution anysane person like has no need for it they
 have no want or desire do you think you

Speaker 1 :have to have some patience for nonsense
 when many people work together in a system how long a string theory go

Speaker 0 :for and how long have I been patient
 okay so you're talking about a mid two patients I'm talking about like 36 yearsof modern nonsense and string theory say
 you can do like eight to ten years but

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :not more I can do 40 minutes this is 30
 sleeve stone now over two hours or no but I appreciate it but it's been 36years of nonsense since the anomaly
 cancellation in in string theory it's like what are you talking about aboutpatients I mean Lex you're not even
 acting like yourself now at what you're trying to stay in the system and I'm not

Speaker 1 :sure I'm not I'm trying to see if
 perhaps so so my hope is that the system just has a few [ __ ] in it which youhighlight and the fundamentals of the
 system are broken because if the fundamentals of the systems are brokenthen I just don't see a way for MIT to
 succeed like I don't see how young people take over MIT I don't see how by

Speaker 0 :inspiring us you know the great part
 about being at MIT like when you saw the the genius in these pranks the heart theirreverence yeah it's like don't do it
 then we were talking about Tom Lehrer the last time Tom Lehrer was as naughtyas the day is long
 agreed agreed was he also a genius was he well-spoken was he highly cultured hewas so talented so intellectual that he
 could just make fart jokes morning noon and night yeah okay well in part theright to make fart jokes the right to
 for example put a functioning phone booth that was ringing on top of theGreat Dome at MIT has to do with we are
 such badasses that we can actually do this stuff well don't tell me about itanymore go break the law go break the
 law in a way that inspires us and makes us not want to prosecute you may breakthe law in a way that lets us know that
 you're calling us out on our [ __ ] that you're filled with love and thatour technical talent has not gone to
 sleep it's not incapable you know and if the idea is that you're gonnadig a moat around the University and
 fill it with tiger sharks that's awesome because I don't know how you're gonna doit but if you actually manage to do that
 I'm not going to prosecute you prosecute you under a reckless endangerment man

Speaker 1 :that's beautifully put
 I hope those first of all they'll listen I hope young people and mighty will takeover in this in this kind of way in the
 introduction to your podcast episode on Jeff Epstein you give to me a reallymoving story but unfortunately for me to
 brief about your experience with a therapist and the lasting terror thatpermeated your mind can you uh can you
 go there can you tell I don't think so I

Speaker 0 :mean I appreciate what you're saying I
 said it obliquely I said enough there are bad people who cross our paths andthe current vogue is to say oh I'm a
 survivor I'm a victim I can do anything I wantthis is a broken person and I don't know
 why I was sent to a broken person as a kid and to be honest with you I alsofelt like in that story I say that I was
 able to say no you know and this was like the entire weight of authority andhe was misusing his position and I was
 also able to say no what I couldn't say no to was having him reinf lichte Din my

Speaker 1 :life I see you were sent back yeah
 second time I tried to complain about

Speaker 0 :what had happened I tried to do it in a
 way that did not immediately cause horrific consequences to both thisperson and myself because I didn't we
 don't have the tools to deal with sexual misbehavior we have nuclear weapons wedon't have any way of saying this is
 probably not a good place or a role for you at this moment as an authorityfigure and something needs to be worked
 on so in general when we see somebody who is misbehaving in that wayour immediate instinct is to treat the
 person as you know Satan and we understand why we don't want ourchildren to be at risk now I personally
 believe that I fell down on the job and did not call out the Jeffrey Epsteinthing early enough because I was
 terrified of what Jeffrey Epstein represents and this recapitulated theold terror trying to tell the world this
 therapist is out of control and when I said that the world responded by sayingwell you have two appointments booked
 and you have to go for the second one so I got reinfected into this office onthis person who was now convinced that I
 was about to tear down his career and his reputation it might have been on theverge of suicide for all I know I don't
 know but he was very very angry and he was furious with me that I had breacheda sacred confidence of his office


Speaker 1 :what kind of ripple effects does that
 have has that head to the rest of your lifethe absurdity and the cruelty of that I
 mean there's no sense to it well see

Speaker 0 :this is the thing people don't really
 grasp I think there's an academic who I got to know many years ago namedJennifer fried who has a theory of
 betrayal which she calls institutional betrayal and her gambit is is that whenyou were betrayed by an institution that
 is sort of like a fiduciary or a parental obligation to take care of youthat you find yourself in a far
 different situation with respect to trauma than if you were betrayed bysomebody who's a peer and so I think
 that my in my situation I kind of repeat a particular dynamic with authority Icome in not following all the rules
 trying to do some things not trying to do others blah blah blah and then I getinto a weird relationship with authority
 and so I have more barians with what I would callinstitutional betrayal now the funny
 part about it is that when you don't have masks or PPE in a influenza likepandemic and you're missing ICU beds and
 ventilators that is ubiquitous institutional betrayal so I believe thatin a weird way I was very early the idea
 of and this is like tough the really hard concept pervasive or otherwiseUniversal institutional betrayal where
 all of the institutions you can count on any hospital to not charge you properlyfor what their services are you can
 count on no pharmaceutical company to produce the drug that will be maximallybeneficial to the people who take it you
 know that your financial professionals are not simply working in your bestinterest and that issue had to do with
 the way in which growth left of our system so I think that the weird thingis is that this first institutional
 betrayal by a therapist left me very open to the idea of okay well maybe theschools are bad maybe the hospitals are
 bad maybe the drug companies are bad maybe our food is off maybe ourjournalists are not serving journalistic
 ends and that was what allowed me to sort of go all the distance and say huhI wonder if our problem is that
 something is causing all of our sense making institutions to be off that wasthe big insight and that tying that to a
 single ideology what if it's just about growth they were all built on growth andnow we've promoted people who are
 capable of keeping quiet that their institutions aren't working so we've theprivileged silent aristocracy the people
 who can be counted upon not to mention a fire when a raging fire is tearingthrough a building but nevertheless it's


Speaker 1 :how big of a psychological burden is
 that it's huge

Speaker 0 :it's terrible I mean rushing it's it's


Speaker 1 :very it's very comforting to be the
 parental I mean I don't know I I treasure I mean we were just talkingabout MIT we can
 until I can intellectualize and agree with everything you're saying butthere's a comfort a warm blanket of
 being within the institution and up

Speaker 0 :until him Aaron Schwartz let's say in
 other words now if I look at the provost and the president as mommy and daddy youdid what to my big brother
 you did what to our family you sold us out in which way what secrets left forChina you hired which workforce you did
 what to my wages you took this portion of my grant forwhat purpose you just stole my
 retirement through a fringe rate what

Speaker 1 :did you do but can you still I mean
 thing is about this view you have is it often turns out to be sadly correct well

Speaker 0 :this is the thing and but that let me


Speaker 1 :just in this silly hopeful thing do you
 still have hope and institutions can you win you psychopsychologically yes I'm referring not
 intellectually because you have to carry this burden can you still have a hopelike within you Jake that when you sit a
 home alone and as opposed to seeing the darkness within these institutionsseeing a hope well but this is the thing


Speaker 0 :I want to confront not for the purpose
 of a dust-up I believe for example if you've heard episode 19 that the bestoutcome is for Carol Greider to come
 forward as we discussed in episode 19 would your brother Brett honest and say

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :you know what so I screwed up he did
 call he did suggest the experiment I didn't understand that it was his theorythat was producing it maybe I was slow
 to grasp it but my bad and I don't want to pay for this bad choice on my partlet's say for the rest of my career I
 want to own up and I want to help make sure that we do what's right with what'sleft and that's one little case within


Speaker 1 :the institution they would like to see


Speaker 0 :made I would like to see MIT very
 clearly come out and you know Margo O'Toole was right whenshe said David Baltimore's lab here
 produced some stuff that was not reproducible with Teresa and Minnieshakarez research I want to see the
 courageous people I would like to see a the Aaron Schwartz wing of the computerscience department yeah wouldn't know
 let's think about it yeah wouldn't that be great if they said you know aninjustice was done and we're gonna we're
 gonna write that wrong just as if this was Alan Turing which I don't think

Speaker 1 :they've righted that wrong well then


Speaker 0 :let's have the Turing Schwartz way to


Speaker 1 :ensure they're starting a new college of
 computing it wouldn't be wonderful to call it the the toyish why I would like

Speaker 0 :to have the Madame wooing of the physics
 department and I'd love to have the Emmy nerd er statue in front of the mathdepartment I mean like you want to get
 excited about actual diversity and inclusion yeah well let's go with ourabsolute best people who never got
 theirs because there is structural bigotry you know but if we don'tactually start celebrating the beautiful
 stuff that we're capable of when we're handed heroes and we fumble them intothe trash what the hell I mean Lex this
 is such nonsense we just pulling our head out you knowthe on everyone's cecum should be
 tattooed if you can read this you're too close

Speaker 1 :beautifully put and I'm a dream or just
 like you so I don't see as much of the darkness genetically or due to my lifeexperience but I do share the hope from
 my teeth as you should know we care a

Speaker 0 :lot about you both do yeah and a harvard


Speaker 1 :institution i don't give a damn about
 but you do so I love Harvard I'm just kidding i yeah i love harvard but rude

Speaker 0 :and i have a very difficult relationship
 and part of what you know when you love a family that isn't working I don't wantto trash I I didn't bring up the name of
 the president of MIT during the Aaron Schwartz period it's not vengeanceI want the rot cleared out I don't need
 to go after human beings yeah just like

Speaker 1 :you said with the with a disc
 formulation they individual human beings aren't don't necessarily carry them

Speaker 0 :it's those chairs that are so powerful
 that in which they sit it's the chairs not the human it's notthe humans without naming names can you


Speaker 1 :tell the story of your struggle during
 your time at Harvard maybe in a way that tells the bigger story of the struggleof young bright minds that are trying to
 come up with big bold ideas within the institutions that we're talking about

Speaker 0 :you can start I mean in part it starts
 with coffee with a couple of Croatians in the math department at MIT and weused to talk about music and dance and
 math and physics and love and all this kind of stuff as Eastern Europeans loveto and I ate it up and my friend
 Gordana who was an instructor in the MIT math department when I was a graduatestudent at Harvard said to me I'm
 probably gonna do a bad version of her accent there we go it will I see youtomorrow at the secret seminar and I
 said what secret seminar it don't joke I said I'm not used to this style of humorGordon she's getting the secret seminar
 that your adviser is running I said what are you talking about ha ha ha you knowyour advisor is running a secret seminar
 on this aspect I think it was like the chern-simons invariantsI'm not sure what the topic was again
 but she gave me the room number and the time and she was like not cracking asmile I've never known her to make this
 kind of a joke and I thought this was crazy and I was trying to have anadvisor I didn't want an advisor but
 people said you have to have one so I took one and I went to this room at like15 minutes early and there was not a
 soul inside it it was outside of the math department and was still in thesame building the Science Center at
 Harvard and I sat there and let five minutes go by hey I let seven minutes goby ten minutes go by there's nobody I
 thought okay so this was all an elaborate joke and then like threeminutes to the hour this graduate
 student walks in and like sees me and does a double take and then I start tosee the professors in geometry and
 topology start to file in and everybody's like very disconcerted thatI'm in this room and finally the person
 who is supposed to be my advisor walks in to the seminar and sees me and goeswhite as a ghost
 and I realized that the secret seminar is true that the department isconducting a secret seminar on the exact
 topic that I'm interested in not telling me about it and that these are thereindeer games that the Rudolph's of the
 department are not invited to and so then I realize okay I did not understandit there's a parallel department and
 that became the beginning of an incredible Odyssey in which I came tounderstand that the game that I had been
 sold about publication about blind refereeing about openness and scientifictransmission of information was all a
 lie I came to understand that at the verytop there's a second system that's about
 closed closed meetings and private communications and agreements aboutcitation and publication that the rest
 of us don't understand and that in large measure that is the thing that I won'tsubmit to and so when you ask me
 questions like well why wouldn't you feel good about you know talking to yourcritics or why wouldn't you feel the
 answer is oh you don't know like if you stay in a nice hotel you don't realizethat there is an entire second structure
 inside of that hotel where like there's usually a workers cafe in a resortcomplex that isn't available to the
 people who are staying in the hotel and then there are private hallways insidethe same hotel that are parallel
 structures so that's what I found which was in essence just the way you can stayhotels your whole life and not realize
 that inside of every hotel is a second structure that you're not supposed tosee is the guest there is a second
 structure inside of academics that behaves totally differently with respectto how people get dinged how people get
 their grants taken away how this person comes to have that thing named afterthem and by pretending that we're not
 running a parallel structure I have no patience for that way anymore so the Igot a chance to see how the game how
 hard ball is really played at Harvard and I'm now eager to play hardball backwith the same people who played hardball


Speaker 1 :with me let me ask two questions on this
 so one do you think it's possible so I call those people [ __ ] but that'sthe technical term do you think it's
 possible that that's just not the entire system but a part of the systemsort of that there's you can navigate
 you can swim in the waters and find the groups of people who do aspire to the

Speaker 0 :guy who wrestled my PhD was one of the
 people who filed in - the secret seminar right but are there

Speaker 1 :pedestrian side of this right is he an


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :[ __ ] well yes I was as a bad no but


Speaker 0 :I'm trying to make this point which is
 this isn't my failure to correctly map these people it's yours you know who hasa simplification that isn't gonna work I


Speaker 1 :think okay as I was the wrong term I
 would say lacking of character and what

Speaker 0 :would you have had these people do why
 did they do this why have a secret seminar I don't understand the exact

Speaker 1 :dynamics of a secret seminar but I think
 the right thing to do is to I mean to see individuals like you there might bea reason to have a secret seminar but
 they should detect that an individual like you a brilliant mind who's thinkingabout certain ideas could be damaged by
 this I don't think they see it that way

Speaker 0 :the idea is we're going to sneak food to
 the children we want to survive yeah so

Speaker 1 :that that's highly problematic and there
 should be people within that road I'm

Speaker 0 :trying to say this is the thing the ball
 is thrown back won't be caught the problem is they know that most of theirchildren won't survive and they can't
 say that I see sorry to interrupt you

Speaker 1 :mean that the the fact that the whole
 system is underfunded that they naturally have to pick favorites they

Speaker 0 :live in a world which reached steady
 state at some level let's say you know in the early 70s and in that worldbefore that time you have a professor
 like Norman's steam rod and you'd have 20 children that is graduate studentsand all of them were going to be
 professors and all of them would want to have 20 children right so you start liketaking higher and higher powers of 20
 and you see that the system could not it's not just about money the systemcouldn't survive so the way it's
 supposed to work now is that we should shut down the vast majority of PhDprograms and we should let the small
 number of truly top places pop mostly teaching and research departmentsthat aren't PhD producing we don't want
 to do that because we use PhD students as a labor force so the whole thing hasto do with growth resources dishonesty
 and in that world you see all of these adaptations to a ruthless world wherethe key question is where are we going
 to bury this huge number of bodies of people who don't work out so my problemwas I wasn't interested in dying so you


Speaker 1 :clearly highlight that there's aspects
 of the system that are broken but as an

Speaker 0 :individual is your role to exit the


Speaker 1 :system or just acknowledge it as a game


Speaker 0 :and win it my role is to survive and
 thrive in the public eye in other words when you have an escapee of the systemlike yourself such as and that person
 says you know I wasn't exactly finished let me show you a bunch of stuff let meshow you that the theory of telomeres we
 never got reported properly let me show you that all of marginal economics issupposed to be redone with a different
 version of the differential calculus let me show you that you didn't understandthe self dual yang-mills equations
 correctly in topology and physics because they're in fact much morebroadly found and it's only the
 mutations that happen in special dimensions there are lots of things tosay but this particular group of people
 like if you just take where are all the Gen X and millennial universitypresidents all right okay they're all
 they're all in a holding pattern now where why in this story you know was ita of telomeres was it an older professor
 and a younger graduate student it's this issue of what would be calledinterference competition so for example
 orcas try to drown minke whales by covering their blowholes so that theysuffocate because the the needed
 resource is air okay well what are the universities dothey try to make sure that you can't be
 viable that you need them that you need their grants you need to be zinged withoverhead charges or fringe rates or all
 of the games that the locals love to play well my point is ok what's the costof this how many people died as a result
 of these interference competition games you know when you take somebody likeDouglas pressure who did green
 fluorescent protein and he drives a shuttle bus right because he his grantruns out and he has to give away all of
 his research and all of that research gets a Nobel Prize and he gets to drivea shuttle bus for $35,000 a year what do


Speaker 1 :you mean by die do you mean their career
 their dreams their yeah holes are there

Speaker 0 :as an academic
 Doug pressure was dead for a long period

Speaker 1 :of time ok so as a person who's escaped
 a system yeah can't you at this because you also have in your mind a powerfultheory that may turn out to be useful
 maybe not let's hope can't you also play the game enough like with the childrenso like publish and but also if you told


Speaker 0 :me that this would work really what I
 want to do you see is I would love to revolutionize a field with an H index ofzero like we have these proxies that
 count how many papers you've written how cited of the papers you've written allthis is nonsense it's interesting it


Speaker 1 :aside what do you mean by a field with
 an H index is a totally new H index is

Speaker 0 :counts somehow how many papers have you
 gotten that gets so many citations yeah let's say H index undefined like forexample I don't have an advisor for my
 PhD but I have to have an advisor as far as something called the math genealogyproject that tracks who advised who who
 advised whom right down the line so I am my own advisor which sets up a loopright how many students do I have an
 infinite number your descendants they don't want to havethat story so I have to be I have to
 have formal advisor Rowell Bhatt and my Wikipedia entry for example says that Iwas advised by Rahul Bhatt which is not
 true so you get fit into a system that says what we have to know what yourh-index is we have to know you know
 where are you a professor if you want to apply for a grant it makes all of theseassumptions what I'm trying to do is to
 impart to show all of this is nonsense this is proxy BS that came up in theinstitutional setting and right now it's
 important for those of us who are still vital like Elon it would be great tohave you on as a professor of physics
 and engineering Yeah right

Speaker 1 :it seems ridiculous to say but just as


Speaker 0 :Charlotte just as a shot in the arm yeah
 you know like be great to have you on at Cal Tech even one day a week yeah oneday a month okay well why can't we be in
 there it's the same reason why can't you be on the view why can't you be on BillMartin we need to know what you're gonna
 do before we take you on the show on the show well I don't want to tell you whatI'm gonna do
 do you think you need to be able to

Speaker 1 :dance the dance a little bit


Speaker 0 :I can't dance the dance floor to be on
 the view oh come on so you can yeah you

Speaker 1 :do yeah I do that fine here's where it's


Speaker 0 :the place that it goes south is there's
 like a set of questions that get you into this more adversarial stuff andyou've in fact asks some of those more
 adversarial questions this setting and they're not things that are necessarilyaggressive but there are things that are
 making assumptions right right well so when you make it I have a questions likeyou know Lex are you avoiding your
 critics you know it's just like okay well why did you frame that that way orthe next question would be it's like do
 you think that you should have a special exemption and that you should have theright to break rules and everyone else
 should have to follow them like that question I find enervating yeah itdoesn't really come out of anything
 meaningful it's just like we feel we're supposed to ask that of the other personto show that we're not captured by their
 madness that's not the real question you want to ask me if you want to get reallyexcited about this you want to ask do
 you think this thing is right yeah weird thing I do do you think thatit's going to be immediately seen to be
 right I don't I think it's gonna it's gonna have an interesting fight and it'sgonna have an interesting evolution and
 well what do you hope to do with it in non-physical terms my gosh I hope itrevolutionizes our relationship of well
 with people outside of the institutional framework and it reinforces into theinstitutional framework where we can do
 the most good to bring the institution's back to health you know it's like theseare positive uplifting questions yeah if
 you had Frank we'll check you wouldn't say Frank let's be honest you have donevery little with your life after the
 original huge show that you used to break onto the physics scene like weweirdly ask people different questions
 based on how they sit down yeah that's

Speaker 1 :very strange right but you have to
 understand that so here's the thing I get these days a large number of emailsfrom people with the equivalent of a
 theory of everything for a GI yeah and I use my own radar BFBS radar to detect onunfairly perhaps whether they're full
 [ __ ] or not right because I love what

Speaker 0 :you're where you're going with this by


Speaker 1 :the way and Mike my concern that I often
 think about is there's elements of brilliance and what people write to meand I and I'm trying to right now as you
 made it clear at the kind of judgments and assumptions we make how am Isupposed to deal with you who are not an
 outsider of the system and think about what you're doing because my radarsaying you're not full of [ __ ] you know


Speaker 0 :what I'm also not completely outside of
 the system that's right you've danced

Speaker 1 :beautifully you've actually get got all
 the credibility that you're supposed to get all the nice little stamps ofapproval not all but a large enough
 amount you use I mean it's hard to put into words exactly why you

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :sound whether your theory turns out to
 be good or not you sound like a special human being I appreciate that and thank

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you in a good way all right so but what
 am I supposed to do with that flood of emails for me AJ why do I sound

Speaker 0 :different I don't know and I would like


Speaker 1 :to systemize that I don't know look you


Speaker 0 :know when you're talking to people you
 very quickly consume eyes like am i claiming to be a physicist no I say itevery turn I'm not a physicist right
 when I say to you when you say something about bundles you say well can youexplain it differently I think you know
 I'm pushing around on this this area that lever over there I'm trying to findsomething that we can play with and
 engage and you know another thing is is that I'll say something at scale so if Iwas saying completely wrong things about
 bundles on the Joe Rogan program you don't think that we wouldn't hear acrushing chorus yes and it's actually
 you know same thing with geometric unity so I put up this this video from thisoxford lecture I understand this not a
 standard lecture but you haven't heard you know the most brilliant people inthe field said well this is obviously
 nonsense they don't know what to make of it yeah I'm gonna hide behind well hehasn't said enough to tale where's the
 paper and where's the paper I've seen

Speaker 1 :the criticism yeah I've gotten the same
 kind of Critias I've published a few things and like especially stuff relatedto Tesla that we did studies and Tesla
 vehicles and the kind of criticism I've gotten was showed that they'recompletely oh right like the guy who had


Speaker 0 :Elon Musk on his program twice is gonna
 give us an accurate assessment yeah exactly exactly it's just very low-level

Speaker 1 :like without actually ever addressing
 you know the content you know Lex I

Speaker 0 :think that in part you're trying to
 solve a puzzle that isn't really your puzzle I think you know that I'm sincereyou don't know whether the theory is
 going to work or not and you know that it's not coming out ofsomebody who's coming out of left field
 like the story makes sense there's enough that's new and creative anddifferent in other aspects where you can
 check me that your real concern is are you really telling me that when youstart breaking the rules you see the
 system for what it is and it's become really vicious and aggressive and theanswer is yes and I had to break the
 rules in part because of learning issues because I came into this field you knowwith a totally different set of
 attributes my profile just doesn't look like anybody else's remotely but as aresult what that did is it showed me
 what is the system true to its own ideals or does it just follow theseweird procedures and then when it when
 you take it off the rails it behaves terribly and that's really what my storyI think does is it just says well he
 completely takes the system into new territory where it's not expecting tohave to deal with somebody with these
 confusing sets of attributes and I think what he's telling us is he believes itbehaves terribly now if you take
 somebody with perfect standardized tests and you know a winner of mathcompetitions and you put them in a ph.d
 program they're probably going to be okay I'm not saying that the system youknow breaks down for any everybody under
 all circumstances I'm saying when you present the system with a novelsituation at the moment it will almost
 certainly break down with probability approaching 100 percent but to me the

Speaker 1 :painful and the tragic thing is it sorry
 to bring out my motherly instinct but it feels like it's too much it could be toomuch of a burden to exist outside the


Speaker 0 :system maybe by psychologically first of
 all I've got a podcast that I that's kind of like you've got amazing friendsI have a life which has more interesting
 people passing through it than I know what to do with and they haven't managedto kill me off yet so so far so good


Speaker 1 :speaking of which you host an amazing
 podcast we've mentioned several times but should mention over and over theportal where you somehow manage every
 single conversation is a surprise you go I mean not just the guest but just thethe places you take them the the kind of
 ways they become challenging and how you recover from that I mean it's uh there'sjust it's full of genuine human moments
 so I really appreciate what you're it's a fun fun podcast to listen to let meask some silly questions about it what
 what have you learned about conversation about human to human conversation well I

Speaker 0 :have a problem and I haven't solved on
 the portal which is that in general when I ask people questions they usually findthey're deeply grooved answers and I'm
 not so interested in all of the deeply grooved answers and so there's acomplaint which I'm very sympathetic to
 actually that I talk over people that I won't sit still for the answer and Ithink that's weirdly sort of correct
 it's not that I'm not interested in hearing other voices it's that I'm notinterested in hearing the same voice on
 my program that I could have gotten on somebody else's and I haven't solvedthat well so I've learned that I need a
 new conversational technique where I can keep somebody from finding theircomfortable place and yet not be the
 voice talking over that person it's

Speaker 1 :funny I didn't sense like your
 conversation with Brett I can sense you detect that the line he's going underdown is you know how it's gonna end and
 you know you think it's a useless line so you'll just stop it right there andyou take them into the direction that
 you think you should go but that requires interruption well and it does

Speaker 0 :so far I haven't found a better way I'm
 looking for a better way it's not it's not like I don't hear the problem I dohear the problem I just I haven't solved
 the problem and you know on the on the bread episode I was insufferable it wasvery difficult to listen to it was so
 overbearing but on the other hand I was right you know it's like funny yeah you

Speaker 1 :keeps
 that but I didn't find that me because I heard brothers like I heard a bigbrother yeah it was pretty bad


Speaker 0 :really I think so I didn't think it was
 bad well a lot of people found it in subsisting and I think it also has to dowith the fact that this has become a
 frequent experience I have several shows where somebody who I very much admireand think of as courageous you know I'm
 talking with them maybe we're friends and they sit down on this show and theyimmediately become this fake person like
 two seconds in there they're sort of saying why I don't to be too critical ortoo harsh and I want to name any names I
 wanted this joint here's like okay I'm gonna put my listeners through threehours of you being sweetness and light
 yeah like at least give me some reality and then we can decide to shelve theshow and never let it here you know that
 the the call of freedom in the in the bigger world but I saw you break out of

Speaker 1 :that a few times I've seen you to be
 successful that I forgot the guest but

Speaker 0 :she was dressed with you worried at the


Speaker 1 :end of the episode you had to nog you
 honor Bob Brett FMS caller

Speaker 0 :yeah and Magnus color the philosopher at
 the University of Chicago yeah you've

Speaker 1 :continuously broken out of her
 you guys went you know I didn't seem pretty genuine I like her I'm completely

Speaker 0 :ethically opposed to what she's
 ethically for which she was great and

Speaker 1 :she wasn't like that you're both going


Speaker 0 :hard bro no yeah cuz I care about her so
 that was awesome yeah but you're saying

Speaker 1 :that some people are difficult to break


Speaker 0 :up well it's just that you know she was
 bringing the courage of her conviction she was sort of defending the system andI thought wow that's a pretty
 indefensible system that's great though she's doing that isn't it yeah I mean it

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :made for an awesome I think it's very


Speaker 0 :informative for the world yes you just


Speaker 1 :hated I just can't stand the idea that


Speaker 0 :somebody says well we don't care who
 gets paid or who gets the credit as long as we get the goodiescuz that seems like insane have you ever


Speaker 1 :been afraid leading into a conversation


Speaker 0 :garry kasparov really by the way I mean


Speaker 1 :I know I'm just a fan taking requests
 but I started I started the beginning in

Speaker 0 :Russian and in fact I used one word
 incorrectly I was terrible you know it was pretty good it's pretty good Russian

Speaker 1 :what was terrible is I think he
 complimented to you right no did he compliment you use that me D complimentyou on your Russian so he said almost


Speaker 0 :perfect Russian yeah like he was


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :[ __ ] that was not great Russian but
 there was not great Russian that was

Speaker 1 :good that was hard that was you tried
 hard which is what matters that is so insulting I hope sobut I do hope you continue I did felt
 like I don't know how long and when it might have been like a two-hourconversation but it felt I hope it
 continues like I feel like you have many your conversation with Gary yeah I wouldlove to hear there's certain
 conversation I was just love to hear well you know he's coming from a very

Speaker 0 :it's this issue about needing to
 overpower people in a very dangerous world and so Gary has that need yeah he

Speaker 1 :wasn't he was interrupting you there's
 an interesting dynamic is an interesting

Speaker 0 :dynamic to Weinstein is going into what


Speaker 1 :I mean to powerhouse egos brilliant no


Speaker 0 :don't say egos Minds my spirits my you


Speaker 1 :don't have any good you're the most
 humble person I know so true no that's a complete lie do you think about your ownmortality death sure are you afraid


Speaker 0 :Wow death I released the theory during
 something that can kill door people sure I was there of course little bit of a

Speaker 1 :parallel that of course of course I


Speaker 0 :don't want it to die with me what do you


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :hope your legacy is oh I hope my legacy
 is accurate I'd like to ride on my accomplishmentsrather than how my community decided to
 ding me while I was alive that would be greatwhat about if it was significantly


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :exaggerated I don't want it you wanted
 to be accurate I'm I've got some pretty terrific stuff and then whether it worksout or doesn't that I would like it to
 reflect what I actually was I'll settle for accurate what would you say what is

Speaker 1 :the greatest element of Eric Weinstein
 accomplishment in life terms of being

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :accurate like what what are you most


Speaker 0 :proud of trying the idea that we were
 stalled out in it in the hardest field at the most difficult juncture and thenI didn't listen to that voice ever it
 said stop you're hurting yourself you're hurting your family hurting everybodyyou're embarrassing yourself you're
 screwing up you can't do this you're a failure you're a fraudturn back save yourself like that voice
 I didn't ultimately listen to it and it was going for 35 37 years very hard and

Speaker 1 :I hope you never listen to that voice
 well it's why you're an inspiration

Speaker 0 :thank you appreciate it you're the eye


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :and just infinitely honored that you


Speaker 1 :would spend time with me you've been a
 mentor to me almost a friend I can't imagine a better person to talk to inthis world so thank you so much for
 talking it I can't wait till we do it

Speaker 0 :again Lex thanks for sticking with me
 and thanks for being the most singular guy in the podcasting space in terms ofall of my interviews I would say that
 the last one I did with you many people feel was my bestand it was a non-conventional one so
 whatever it is that you're bringing to the game I think everyone's noticing andkeep at it
