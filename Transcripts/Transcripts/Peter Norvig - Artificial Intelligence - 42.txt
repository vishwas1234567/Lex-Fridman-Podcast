Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 peter norvig he's a director of research

Speaker 0 :at google


Speaker 1 :and the co-author with stuart russell of
 the book artificial intelligence and

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :modern approach
 that educated and inspired a whole generation of researchers includingmyself
 to get into the field of artificial intelligencethis is the artificial intelligence
 podcast if you enjoy it

Speaker 0 :subscribe on youtube give it five stars
 on itunes

Speaker 1 :support on patreon or simply connect
 with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f-r-i-d-m-a-nand now here's my conversation with
 peter

Speaker 0 :norvig most researchers in the ai
 community including myself own all three editions red green andblue of the uh
 artificial intelligence a modern approach it's a field-definingtextbook as many people are aware that
 you wrote with stuart russell how has the book changed and how haveyou changed
 in relation to it from the first edition to the second to the third and now

Speaker 1 :fourth edition as you work on it yeah so
 it's been a lot of years a lot of changes one of the thingschanging from the first
 to maybe the second or third was just the rise of uh computing powerright so i think in the in the first
 edition we said uh here's predicate logicbut uh that only goes so far because
 pretty soon you have millions of uh short littlepredicate expressions and they couldn't
 possibly fit in memory uh so we're going to use first orderlogic that's more concise
 and then we quickly realized oh predicate logic is pretty nicebecause there are really fast sat
 solvers and other things and look there's only millions ofexpressions and that fits easily into
 memory or maybe even billions fit into memory nowso that was a change of the type of
 technology we needed just because the hardware expanded even

Speaker 0 :to the second edition
 resource constraints were loosened significantly yeahyeah and that was the early 2000s second


Speaker 1 :edition
 right so 95 was the first and then 2000 2001 or so and then moving on from therei think we're starting to see that again
 with the gpus and then more specific type ofmachinery like the tpus and using custom
 asics and so on for deep learning so we're seeinganother advance in terms of the hardware
 then i think another thing that we especially notice this time aroundis in all three of the first editions we
 kind of said well we're going to find ai asmaximizing expected utility
 and you tell me your utility function and now we've got27 chapters worth of cool techniques for
 how to optimize that i think in this edition we're sayingmore you know what
 maybe that optimization part is the easy part and the hard partis deciding what is my utility function
 what do i want and if i'm a collection of agents or asociety
 what do we want as a whole so you touch

Speaker 0 :that topic in this edition you get a
 little bit more into utility yeah that's really interesting on atechnical level we're almost pushing the
 philosophical

Speaker 1 :i guess it is philosophical right so we
 we've always had a philosophy chapter which which i was uhglad to that we were supporting
 and now it's less kind of the uh you know chinese room type argument andmore of these
 uh ethical and societal type issues so we get intouh the issues of fairness and bias
 and uh and just the issue of aggregating utilities so how

Speaker 0 :do you encode human values into a
 utility function is is this something that you can do purely through data in alearned way or is there
 some systematic obviously there's no good answers yetthere's just uh beginnings to this uh to
 even opening

Speaker 1 :doors so there is no one answer yes
 there are techniques uh to try to learn that so we talk about inversereinforcement learning
 right so reinforcement learning uh you take some actions you get some rewardsand you figure out what actions you
 should take in inverse reinforcement learning youobserve somebody
 taking actions and you figure out uh wellthat this must be what they were trying
 to do if they did this action it must be because they want itof course there's restrictions to that
 right so lots of people take actions that areself-destructive
 uh where they're they're suboptimal in certain ways so you don't want to learnthat
 right you want to uh somehow learn the uh the perfect actionsuh rather than the ones they actually
 take so so that's a challenge uh for that field thenanother big part of it is just kind of
 uh theoretical of saying uh what can we accomplish andso you look at like this
 this work on the uh programs to uh predict recidivism and decide uhyou know who should get parole or who
 should get bail or whatever uh and how are you gonna evaluate thatand
 one of the big issues is fairness across protected classesprotected classes being things like uh
 sex and race and so on and uh so two things you want is youwant to say well if i get a score of say
 uh six out of ten then i want that to mean the samewhether no matter what race i'm on yes
 right so i want to have a 60 percent chance of reoccurringuh regardless uh and the makers of the
 one of the makers of a commercial program to do that says that's whatwe're trying to optimize and look
 we achieved that we've we've reached that kind ofbalance and then on the other side you
 also want to say well if if it makes mistakes i want thatto affect
 both sides of the protected class equallyand it turns out they don't do that
 right so they're they're twice as likely to make amistake that would harm a black person
 over a white person so that seems unfair so you'd like to say well i want toachieve both those goals
 and then it turns out you do the analysis and it's theoreticallyimpossible
 to achieve both those goals so you have to trade them off one against the otherso that analysis is really helpful to
 know what you can aim for and how much youcan get that you can't have everything
 but the analysis certainly can't tell you where should we make that

Speaker 0 :trade-off point but nevertheless then we
 can uh as humans deliberate where that

Speaker 1 :trade-off should be yeah so at least we
 now we're we're arguing an informed way we're notasking for something impossible
 we're saying uh here's where we are and and here's what we aim for andthis strategy is better than that


Speaker 0 :strategy
 so that's i would argue is a really powerful and really important first stepbut it's a doable one sort of removing
 uh undesirable degrees of bias in uh insystems
 in terms of protected classes and then there's something i listen to your uhcommencement speech
 or there's some fuzzier things like you mentioned angry birds yeahdo you want do you want to create
 systems that feed the dopamine enjoyment that feedthat optimize for you returning to the
 system enjoying the moment of playing the game ofgetting likes or whatever
 this kind of thing or some kind of long-term improvementright is if are you even thinking about
 that that's ex that's really going to thephilosophical area


Speaker 1 :i think that's a really important issue
 too certainly thinking about that i i don't think about thatas a as an ai issue as much
 but as you say you know the point is we'vebuilt this society in this
 infrastructure where we say we have a marketplace forattention
 and uh we've decided as a society that we like things that are freeand so we want all uh apps on our phone
 to be free uh and that means they're all competingfor your attention and then eventually
 they they make some money some way through uhads or in-game sales or whatever
 but they can only win by defeating all the other apps byinstilling your attention and
 we build a marketplace where it seems like they'reworking against you rather than working
 with you and i'd like to find a way where we canchange the playing field so we feel more
 like well these things are on my side yes they're letting me have some fun inthe short term but they're also helping
 me in the long term rather than competingagainst me


Speaker 0 :and those aren't necessarily conflicting
 objectives they're just the incentives the direct currentincentives as we try to figure out this
 whole new world seem to be on uh the easier part of thatwhich is feeding the dopamine
 the rush right but uh let me take a quick step backat the beginning of the artificial
 intelligence and modern approach book of writingso here you are in the 90s when you
 first sat down with stuart to write the bookto cover
 an entire field which is one of the only books that successfully done that for aiand
 actually in a lot of other computer science fieldsyou know it's a dif it's a it's a huge
 undertaking so it must have been quite daunting whatwas that process like did you envision
 that you would be trying to cover the entire fieldwas there a systematic approach to it
 that was more step by step

Speaker 1 :how did it feel so i guess it came about
 you know go to lunch with the other ai faculty atberkeley
 and we'd say uh you know the field is changingseems like the current books are a
 little bit behind nobody's come out with a new book recently we should do thatand everybody said yeah yeah that's a
 great thing to do and we never did anythingright and then i ended up heading off
 to uh industry i went to uh sun labs so i thought well that's the end ofmy possible academic publishing career
 but i met stuart again at a conference like a year laterand said you know that book we were
 always talking about you guys must be half done with it by now righthe said well we keep talking we never do
 anything so i said well you know we should do itand i think the reason is that
 we all felt it was a time where the field was changingand that was in two ways
 so you know the good old-fashioned ai was baseduh primarily on boolean logic you had a
 few tricks to deal with uncertainty and itwas based
 primarily on knowledge engineering then the way you got something done is youwent out you interviewed an expert and
 you wrote down by hand everything they knew and we saw inin 95 that the field was changing in
 in two ways one we're moving more towards probabilityrather than boolean logic and we're
 moving more towards machine learning rather than knowledge engineering uh andthe other books uh
 hadn't caught that way if they were still in the uhmore in the in the old school although
 so certainly they had part of that on the way but we said if we start nowcompletely taking that point of view we
 can have a different kind of book and we were able to put that together

Speaker 0 :and uh what was literally the process if
 you remember did you start writing a chapter did yououtline


Speaker 1 :yeah i guess i guess we did an outline
 and then we sort of assigned chapters to each person at the time uhi had moved to boston and stewart was in
 berkeley so basically uh we did it uhuh over the internet and uh you know
 that wasn't the same as doing it today it meant you knowdial-up lines and telnetting in and
 you know you you telnetted into one shell and you type cat file name andyou hoped it was captured at the other
 end and

Speaker 0 :certainly you're not sending uh images
 and figures back and forth

Speaker 1 :right right that didn't work but you


Speaker 0 :know did you anticipate where the field
 would go from that day from from the 90sdid you see the
 growth into learning-based methods into data-driven methodsthat followed in the future decades we


Speaker 1 :certainly thought
 that learning was important i guess we we missed it as uh being as important asit
 as it is today we missed this idea of big data we missed that uhuh the idea of deep learning hadn't been
 invented yet we could have uh taken the book from acomplete uh machine learning point of
 view right from the start we chose to do itmore from a point of view of we're going
 to first develop different types of representations andwe're going to talk
 about different types of environments of is it fully observable or partiallyobservable and is it
 deterministic or stochastic and so on and wemade it more complex along those axes
 rather than focusing on the machine learning axisfirst


Speaker 0 :do you think you know there's some sense
 in which the deep learning craze is extremely successful for a particularset of problems
 and you know eventually it's going to in the general casehit challenges so in terms of the
 difference between perception systems and robots that haveto act in the world
 do you think uh we're going to return to ai modern approach type breadthin addition five and six yeah
 in uh in future decades do you think deep learning will take its place as achapter and as
 in his bigger uh view of ai yeah i think

Speaker 1 :we don't know yet how it's all going to
 play out so uh in the new edition uh we have achapter on deep learning
 uh we got ian goodfellow to be the guest authorfor that chapter so he said he could
 condense his whole deep learning book into onechapter i think he did a great job
 we were also encouraged that he's you know we gave himthe old neural net chapter and said
 have fun with it modernize that and he said you know half of thatwas okay that certainly there's lots of
 new things that have been developed but some of the core was still the sameso i think we'll gain a better
 understanding of what you can do there i think we'll need to incorporate allthe things we can do with the other
 technologies right so deep learning started outconvolutional networks and very close to
 perception uh and has since moved to be uhto be able to do more with actions and
 some degree of longer term planning but we need to do abetter job
 with representation than reasoning and one-shot learning and so on andwell i think we don't know yet how
 that's going to play out

Speaker 0 :so do you think looking at the
 some success but certainly uh eventual demise the partial demise ofexperts to symbolic
 systems in the 80s do you think there is kernels of wisdomin the work that was done there with
 logic and reasoning and so on that will rise again in your view

Speaker 1 :so certainly i think the idea of
 representation and reasoning is crucial that you know sometimes youjust don't have enough data about the
 world to learn de novo so you've got to havesome idea of representation whether that
 was programmed in or told or whatever and then be able to take uh steps ofreasoning
 i i think the problem uh with the you know the good old-fashioned aiwas uh one we tried to base everything
 on these uh symbols that were atomicand that's great if you're like trying
 to define the properties of a triangle right because they have necessaryinsufficient conditions
 uh but things in the real world don't the real world is is messy and doesn'thave sharp edges
 and atomic symbols do so that was a poor matchand then the other aspect was that the
 reasoning was universal and applied anywhere which in some sense is good butit also means there's no guidance
 as to where to apply it and so you you know you started getting these paradoxeslike
 uh well if i have a mountain and i removeone grain of sand then it's still a
 mountain and but if i do that repeatedly at somepoint it's not
 right and with logic you know there's nothing to stopyou from applying things uh repeatedly
 but maybe with something like deep learning and i don't really knowwhat the right name for it is
 we could separate out those ideas so one we could sayuh you know a mountain isn't just an
 atomic notion it it's some sort of somethinglike uh word embedding that
 uh uh has a a more complex representation yeah andsecondly we could somehow learn yeah
 there's this rule that you can remove one grain of sandand you can do that a bunch of times but
 you can't do it a near infinite amount of timesbut on the other hand when you're doing
 induction on the integer sure then it's fine to do it an infinitenumber of times and
 if we could uh somehow we have to learn when these strategies are applicablerather than having the strategies be
 completely neutral and available everywhere anytime you use

Speaker 0 :neural networks anytime you learn
 from data or form representation from data in an automated wayit's not very explainable as
 to or it's not introspective to us humansin terms of uh how this neural network
 sees the world where why does it succeed so brilliantlyon so many in so many cases
 and fail so miserably in surprising ways and smallso what do you think is this is uh
 the future there can simply more data better data more organized datasolve that problem or is there
 elements of symbolic systems that need to be brought in which are a little bitmore explainable


Speaker 1 :yeah so i prefer to talk about
 trust and uh validation and verification rather than just about explainabilityand then i think uh
 explanations are one tool that you use towards those goalsand i think it is important issue that
 we don't want to use these systems unless wetrust them and we want to understand
 where they work and where they don't workand in an explanation can be part of
 that right so i apply for loan and i getdenied i want some explanation of why
 and you have in europe we have the gdpr thatsays
 you're required to be able to get that but on the other handexplanation alone is not enough right so
 you know we're used to dealing with people and with theorganizations and corporations and so on
 and they can give you an explanation then you have no guarantee that thatexplanation relates to reality
 right right so the bank can tell me well you didn't get the loanbecause you didn't have enough
 collateral and that may be true or it may be true that they just didn'tlike my religion
 or or something else i can't tell from the explanation and that'sthat's true whether the decision was
 made by computer or by a person so i want morei do want to have the explanations and i
 want to be able to uh have a conversation to go back and forthand said well you gave this explanation
 but what about this and what would have happened if this hadhappened and uh
 what would i need to change that so i think a conversation isis a better way to think about it than
 just an explanation as a single output and i think we need testing of variouskinds right so in order to know
 was the decision really based on my collateral or was itbased on my uh religion or skin color or
 whatever i can't tell if i'm only looking at mycase but if i look across all the cases
 then i can detect a pattern all right right so you want to have that kind ofcapability
 uh you want to have these adversarial testing right so we thought we weredoing pretty good
 at object recognition in images we said lookwe're at sort of pretty close to human
 level performance on imagenet and so on and then you startseeing these
 adversarial images and you say wait a minute that part is nothing likehuman performance okay you can mess with


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :it really easily you can mess with it
 really easily right and uh yeah you could do that tohumans too right so
 in a different way perhaps right humans don't know what color the dress wasright and so they're vulnerable to
 certain attacks that are different than the attacks on the on the machinesbut the
 you know the tax on the machines are so striking uh they really change the wayyou think about what we've done
 right and the the way i think about it is i think part of the problem is we'reseduced
 by uh our low dimensional metaphors right yeah so you know youlook like that phrase
 you look in uh in a textbook and you say okay now we've mapped out the space andyou know
 uh cat is here and dog is here and maybe there's a tiny little spot inthe middle where you can't tell the
 difference but mostly we've got it all coveredand if you believe that metaphor uh then
 you say well we're nearly there and uh you know there's only going to bea couple adversarial images
 but i think that's the wrong metaphor and what you should really say isit's not a 2d flat space that we've got
 mostly covered it's a million dimension space and a catis this string that goes out in this
 crazy bath and if you step a little bit offthe path in any direction you're in
 nowhere's land and you don't know what's going tohappen and so i think that's where we
 are and now we've got to deal with that souh it wasn't so much an explanation but
 it was an understanding of what the models are and what they'redoing and now we can start exploring how
 do you fix that

Speaker 0 :yeah validating the robustness of the
 system so on but take it back to the this uh this word trust uh do you thinkwe're
 a little too hard on our robots in terms of uh the standards we applyso you know
 of uh there's a dance there's a there's a there's a dance and nonverbaland verbal communication between humans
 you know if we apply the same kind of standard in terms of humansyou know we trust each other pretty
 quickly uh you know you and i haven't met beforeand there's some degree of trust


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :right that nothing's gonna go crazy
 wrong and yet to ai when we look at ai systems where we seemto approach
 uh through skepticism always always and it's like theyhave to prove through a lot of hard work
 that they're even worthy of uh even inkling of our trust do itwhat do you what do you think about that
 how how do we break that barrier close that gap

Speaker 1 :i think that's right i think that's a
 big issue uh just listening uh my friend uh mark moffat is a naturalistand he says uh the most amazing thing
 about humans is that you can walk into a coffee shopor
 a a busy street in a city and there's lots of people around youthat you've never met before and you
 don't kill each other yeah he says chimpanzees cannot do thatyeah right
 right if the chimpanzee's in a situation wherehere's some that aren't from my tribe
 bad things happen especially in a coffee

Speaker 0 :shop there's delicious food around you
 know

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah but but we humans have figured
 that out yeah right uh and you know for the most part forthe most part we still go to war
 we still do terrible things uh but for the most part we've learned totrust each other and live together uh so
 that's going to be important for our uh our ai systems as welland i th also i think uh you know a lot
 of the emphasis is on ai but in many casesai is part of the technology but isn't
 really the main thing so a lot of what we've seen is more due tocommunications technology
 than ai ai technology yeah you want to makethese good decisions but the reason
 we're able to have any kind of system at allis we've got the communication so that
 we're collecting the data and so that we can reach lots of peoplearound the world
 i think that's a bigger change that we're dealing with

Speaker 0 :speaking of reaching a lot of people
 around the world on the side of educationyou've uh one of the many things in
 terms of education you've done you taughtthe intro to artificial intelligence
 course that signed up 100 160 000 students is one of the firstsuccessful examples
 and massive of a mooc massive open online coursewhat did you learn from that experience
 what do you think is the future of moocs of education online yeah it was

Speaker 1 :a great fun
 doing it particularly uh being right at the start just because it wasexciting and new
 but it also meant that we had less competitionright so uh one of the things you hear
 about uh well the problem with moocs is uh the completion rates are are so lowso there must be a failure
 and and i gotta admit i'm a prime contributor right i've probablystarted 50 different courses that i
 haven't finished but i got exactly what i wanted out ofthem because i had never intended to
 finish them i just wanted to dabble in a little bit either to see thetopic matter or just to see the pedagogy
 of how are they doing this class so i guess the main thing i learned iswhen i came in
 i thought the challenge was information saying if i'm justtake the stuff i want you to know and
 i'm very clear and explain it well then my job is doneand good things are going to happen and
 then in doing the course i learned well yeah you got to have theinformation but really
 the motivation is the most important thing thatif students don't stick with it it
 doesn't matter how good the content is and i think being one of the firstclasses
 we were helped by uh sort of exterior motivationso we tried to do a good job of making
 it enticing and setting up ways for uhyou know the community to work with each
 other to make it more motivating but really a lot of it was hey this is anew thing and i'm really excited to be
 part of a new thing and so the students brought their ownmotivation
 and so i think this is great because there's lots of people around the worldwho have never had this before
 you know it would never have the opportunityto go to stanford and take a class or go
 to mit or go to one of the other schools but now we can bring that to them and ifthey bring their own motivation
 they can be successful in a way they couldn't beforebut that's really just the top tier of
 people that are ready to do that the rest of the peoplejust don't see or don't have their
 motivation and don't see how if they push through and were able to do itwhat advantage that would get them so i
 think we've got a long way to go before we're able to do that and i thinkit'll be some of it is
 based on technology but more of it's based on the idea of community that yougot to
 actually get people together some of the getting together can be done online ithink some of it really has to be done
 in person to be able in order to build that type ofcommunity and trust you know there's an


Speaker 0 :intentional
 mechanism that we've developed uh a short attention spanespecially younger people uh because
 sort of shorter and shorter videos online uhthere's a
 whatever the the way the brain is developing nowwith people that have grown up with the
 internet they have a quite a short attention span soand i would say i had the same when i
 was growing up too probably for different reasons so iprobably wouldn't have
 learned as much as i have if i wasn't forced to sit in a physical classroomsort of bored sometimes falling asleep
 but sort of forcing myself through that processto sometimes extremely difficult
 computer science courses what's the difference in your viewbetween in-person
 education experience which you first of allyourself had and you yourself taught and
 online education and how do we close that gap if it'seven possible yeah


Speaker 1 :so i think there's two issues one is
 whether it's in person or online so it's sort of the physicallocation and then the other is kind of
 the affiliation right soyou stuck with it in part because you
 were in the classroom and you saw everybody else was suffering right thesame way you were
 but also because you were enrolled you had paid tuitionsort of everybody was expecting you to
 stick with it

Speaker 0 :society parents yeah peers


Speaker 1 :right and so those are two separate
 things i mean you could certainly imaginei pay a huge amount of tuition and
 everybody signed up and says yes you're doing thisuh but then i'm in my room and my
 classmates are in are in different rooms rightwe could have things set up that way so
 it's not just the online versus offline i think what's more important is thecommitment
 that you've made and certainly it is important to have thatkind of informal
 you know i meet people outside of class we talk together because we're all in ittogether
 i think that's uh really important both in keeping your motivation and alsothat's where
 some of the most important learning goes on so you want to have thatmaybe you know especially now we start
 getting into higher bandwidths and augmented realityand virtual reality you might be able to
 get that without being in the same physical place do you think it's

Speaker 0 :possible we'll see a course
 at stanford for example that for students enrolled students is onlyonline
 in the near future who are literally sort of that's part of the curriculumand there is


Speaker 1 :no yeah so you're starting to see that i
 know uh georgia tech has a master's that's done that wayoftentimes


Speaker 0 :it's sort of they're creeping in in
 terms of a master's program or sort of umfurther education considering the
 constraints of students and so on but i mean literally is it possible thatwe just you know stanford mit berkeley
 all these places go online only in uh in the next fewdecades


Speaker 1 :yeah probably not because you know
 they've got a big commitment to a physical campus sure right

Speaker 0 :there's a momentum that's both financial
 and culturally right and

Speaker 1 :and then there are certain things that
 just hard to do uh virtually right so you know we're in a field uh where uhif you have your own computer and your
 own paper and so on uh you can do the workanywhere
 uh but if you're in a biology lab or something uh you knowyou don't have all the right stuff at
 home right

Speaker 0 :so our field programming you've also
 done a lot of you've done a lot of programming

Speaker 1 :yourself


Speaker 0 :in 2001 you wrote a great article about
 programming called teach yourself programming in 10 yearssort of response to
 all the books that say teach yourself programming in 21 days so if you'regiving advice to someone getting into
 programming today this is a few years since you've writtenthat article what's the best way to
 undertake that journey

Speaker 1 :i think there's lots of different ways
 and i think programming means more thingsnow and i guess you know when i wrote
 that article i was thinking more aboutbecoming a professional software
 engineer and i thought that's a you know a sort of a career-long fieldof study
 but i think there's lots of things now that people can dowhere programming is a part of
 solving what they want to solve without achieving that professional level statusright so i'm not going to be going and
 writing a million lines of code but you know i'm a biologist or aphysicist or something
 or even a historian and i've got some dataand i want to ask a question of that
 data and i think for that you don't need 10 years rightso
 there are many shortcuts to being able toanswer those kinds of questions and and
 you know you see today a lot of emphasis on learning to codeteaching kids how to code uh i think
 that's great uh but i wish they would change themessage a little bit
 right so i think code isn't the main thing i don't really care if you knowthe
 syntax of javascript or if you can connect these blocks together in thisvisual language
 but what i do care about is that you can analyze a problemyou can think of a solution you can
 carry out you know make a model run that model test the model see theresults
 verify that they're reasonable ask questions and answer themright so it's more modeling and problem
 solving and you use coding in order to do thatbut it's not just learning coding for
 its own sake that's really interesting

Speaker 0 :so
 it's actually almost in many cases it's learning to work with datato extract something useful out of data
 so when you say problem solving you really mean taking some kind ofmaybe collecting some kind of data set
 cleaning it up and saying something interesting about it which is useful inall kinds of domains


Speaker 1 :and you know and i see myself
 being stuck sometimes in kind of the the old waysright so you know be working on a
 project maybe with a younger employee and we sayoh well here's this new package that
 could help solve this problem and i'll go and i'll startreading the manuals and you know i'll be
 two hours into reading the manuals and thenmy colleague comes back and says i'm
 done yeah you know i downloaded the package i installed it i tried callingsome things
 the first one didn't work the second one work now i'm doneyeah and i say but i have 100 questions
 about how does this work and how does that work and they saywho cares right i don't need to
 understand the whole thing i unders i answered my questionit's a big complicated package i don't
 understand the rest of it but i got the right answer and i'm just it'shard for me
 to get into that mindset i want to understand the whole thing and you knowif they wrote a manual
 i should probably read it and but that's not necessarily the right way i think ihave to get used to
 dealing with more being more comfortable with uncertainty and not knowingeverything yeah so i struggle with the


Speaker 0 :same instead of the
 the spectrum between donald and don knuth yeahit was kind of the very you know before
 he can say anything about a problem he really has to getdown to the machine code assembly
 yeah versus exactly what you said i've have several students in my group thatuh you know
 20 years old and they can solve almost any problem within a few hours thatwould take me probably weeks because i
 would try to as you said read the manual sodo you think the nature of mastery
 you're you're mentioning biology sort of outside disciplines applyingprogramming but computer scientists
 so over time there's higher and higher levels of abstraction available nowso with uh this week there's a the
 tensorflow summit right so if you're if you're not particularlyinto deep learning but you're still a
 computer scientist uh you can accomplish an incredibleamount with uh tensorflow without really
 knowing any fundamental internals of machinelearning do you think the nature of
 mastery is is changing even for computerscientists
 like what it means to be an expert programmer

Speaker 1 :yeah i think that's true you know we
 never really should have focused on programmer right because it's still it'sthe skill
 and what we really want to focus on is the result so wewe built this uh ecosystem where the way
 you can get stuff done is by programming it yourself at leastwhen i started
 that you know library functions meant you had square root and that was aboutit
 right everything else you built from scratch and then we built up anecosystem where
 a lot of times well you can download a lot of stuff that doesa big part of what you need and so now
 it's more a question of assembly rather than[Music]
 manufacturing and that's a different way of looking atproblems from another perspective in


Speaker 0 :terms of mastery and
 looking at programmers or people that reason about problems in a computationalway
 so google is you know the from the hiring perspective from the perspectiveof hiring or building a team of
 programmers how do you determine if someone's a goodprogrammer or
 if somebody again yeah i want to deviate from i want to move away from the wordprogrammer but
 somebody who can solve problems of large-scale data and so onwhat's what's uh how do you build a team
 like that through the interviewing process

Speaker 1 :yeah and i and i think uh as a company
 grows uh you get more uh expansivein the types of people you're looking
 for right so i think you know in the early days we'd interview peopleand the question we were trying to ask
 is uh how close are they to jeff dean and most people were pretty far away butwe take the ones that were you know not
 that far away and so we got kind of a homogeneousgroup of people who are really great
 programmers then as a company grows you say well wedon't want everybody
 to be the same to have the same skill set and so nowwe're uh hiring uh biologists in our
 health areas and we're hiring physicists we're hiringmechanical engineers we're hiring uh you
 know social scientists and ethnographers andpeople with different backgrounds who
 bring different skills so you have mentioned

Speaker 0 :that you still may partake in code
 reviews given that you have a wealth ofexperience as you've also mentioned
 uh what errors do you often see and tend to highlight in the code ofjunior developers of people coming up
 now uh given your background from blispto a couple decades of programming yeah


Speaker 1 :that's a great question
 you know sometimes i try to look at the flexibilityof the design of yes
 you know this api solves this problem butuh where is it going to go in the future
 who else is going to want to call this and uh you know are you making it easierfor them to do that it's a matter of


Speaker 0 :design is it documentation is it is it
 uh sort of an amorphous thing you can't really put itit's just how it feels if you put
 yourself in the shoes of a developer would you use this kind of thing i think

Speaker 1 :it is how you feel
 right and so yeah documentation is good uh but it's but it's more a designquestion right if you get the design
 right then people will figure it out whether thedocumentation is good or not and
 and if the design is wrong then it'll be harder to use

Speaker 0 :how have uh you yourself changed as a
 programmer over the years as in in a way wealready started to say sort of you want
 to read the manual you want to understand the core of thesyntax to the how the language is
 supposed to be used and so on but what's the evolution been like fromthe 80s 90s to today


Speaker 1 :i guess one thing is you don't have to
 worry about the small details of efficiency as muchas you used to
 right so like i remember uh i did my list book in the 90s and one of thethings i wanted to do
 was say uh here's how you do an object systemand uh basically we're going to make it
 so each object is a hash table and you look up the methods and here's how itworks and then i said
 of course the real common lisp object system is much more complicatedit's got all these efficiency
 type issues and this is just a toy nobody would do this in real lifeand it turns out python pretty much did
 exactly what i said yeah and said uh objects arejust dictionaries and yeah they have a
 few little uh tricks as well but mostly you know the thing thatwould have been 100 times too slow in
 the 80s is now plenty fast for most everything so you

Speaker 0 :had to as a programmer let go
 of perhaps an obsession that i remember coming up with of tryingto write


Speaker 1 :efficient code yeah that to say you know
 what really matters is the total time it takes to get theproject done
 and most of that's going to be the programmer time so if you're a littlebit less efficient but it makes it
 easier to understand and modify then that's theright trade-off
 so you've written quite a bit about lisp

Speaker 0 :your book on programming is in lisp
 you you have a lot of code out there that's in lispso myself and people who don't know what
 lisp is should look it up it's my favorite language for many airesearchers it is a favorite language
 the favorite language they never use these daysso what part of the list do you find
 most beautiful and powerful

Speaker 1 :so i think the beautiful part is the
 simplicity that in half a page you can define the wholelanguage
 and other languages don't have that so you feel like you can hold everythingin your head and
 then you know a lot of people say well then that's too simple you know here'sall these things i want to do
 and you know my java or python or whateverhas 100 or 200 or 300 different syntax
 rules and don't i need all those and lisp's answer was no we're onlygoing to give you
 eight or so syntax rules but we're going to allow you to define your ownand so that was a very powerful idea and
 i think this idea of saying i can start with my problem and with mydata
 and then i can build the language i want uhfor that problem and for that data and
 then i can make lists define that languageso you uh you're sort of uh mixing
 levels and saying i'm simultaneously a programmer in a language and alanguage designer
 and that allows a better match between your problemand your eventual code and i think lis
 had done that better than other languages yeah it's a very elegant

Speaker 0 :implementation of functional programming
 but why do you think lisp has not had the mass adoption and success oflanguages like python
 is it the parentheses is it all the parentheses

Speaker 1 :yeah so i think a couple of things
 so one was i think it was designed for a single programmer or a small teamand a skilled programmer who
 had the good taste to say well i'm i am doing language designand i have to make good choices and if
 you make good choices that's great if you make bad choicesyou can hurt yourself and it can be hard
 for other people on the team to understand itso i think there was a limit to the
 scale of the size of a project in terms ofnumber of people that lisp was good for
 and as an industry we kind of grew beyond thati think it is in part the parentheses
 you know one of the jokes is the acronym for lisp islots of irritating silly parentheses
 my acronym was lisp is syntactically puresaying all you need is parentheses and
 atoms but i remember you know so we had the the ai textbookand
 uh because we did it in the 90s we had we had pseudocode in the book but thenwe said well we'll have lisp online
 because that's the language of ai at the time and i remember some ofthe students complaining
 because they hadn't had lists before and they didn't quite understand what wasgoing on and
 i remember one student complained i don't understand how this pseudocodecorresponds to this lisp and there was a
 one-to-one correspondence between the the symbols in the code inthe pseudocode and the only thing
 difference was the parentheses so i said it must be that for somepeople a certain number of left
 parentheses shuts off their brain

Speaker 0 :yeah it's very it's very possible in
 that sense then python just goes the other wayand so so that was the point at which i


Speaker 1 :said okay can't have only lisp that's a
 language because i you know i don't want to youknow you only got 10 or 12 or 15 weeks
 or whatever it is to teach ai and i don't wantto waste two weeks of that teaching lisp
 so i say i got to have another language java was the most popular language atthe time
 i started doing that and then i said it's really hard tohave a one-to-one correspondence between
 the pseudocode and the java because java's so verboseso then i said i'm going to do a survey
 and find the language that's most like my pseudocode and turned out pythonbasically was
 my pseudo code somehow i had channeled uh guido and designed a pseudocode thatwas the same as python although i hadn't
 heard of python uh at that point and from then on uhthat's what i've been using because it's
 been a good match

Speaker 0 :so what's the story in python behind
 pietudes your github repository with puzzles and exercises and python ispretty fun


Speaker 1 :yeah just it seems like fun uh you know
 you know i like uh doing puzzles and i like uh being aneducator
 i did a class with udacity uh udacity uh 212 i think it was it was basicallyproblem solving uh using python
 and looking at different problems does pie tubes feed that class

Speaker 0 :in terms of the exercises i was
 wondering what that yeah so the class

Speaker 1 :the class came first
 yeah some of the stuff that's in pi tubes was write-ups of what was in theclass and then some of it was just
 continuing to uh to work on new problems

Speaker 0 :so what's the organizing madness of pi
 tubes is it just the collect a collection of cool exercisesjust whatever i thought was fun okay


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :awesome
 so you were the director of search quality of google from2001 to 2005. in the early days
 uh when there's just a few employees and when the company was growinglike crazy right so
 i mean a google revolution has the way we discovershare and aggregate knowledge
 so just this is uh this is one of the fundamental aspects of civilizationright is information
 being shared and there's different mechanisms throughout history but googleis just
 10x improved that right and you're a part of thatright people discovering that
 information so what were some of the challengeson the philosophical or the technical
 level in those early days

Speaker 1 :it definitely was an exciting time and
 as you say we were doubling in size every yearand the challenges were we wanted to get
 the right answers right and uh we had to figure outwhat that meant we had to implement that
 and we had to make it all uh efficient and uhwe had to keep on testing and seeing if
 we were delivering good answers and now when you say good answers it

Speaker 0 :means whatever people are typing in in
 terms of keywords in terms that kind of thing that the the resultsthey get are ordered by the desirability
 for them of those results like they're like thefirst thing they click on will likely be
 the thing that they were actually looking for right one of the

Speaker 1 :metrics we had was focused on the first
 thing uh some of it was focused on the wholepage so it was focused on
 you know top three or so so we looked at a lot of different metrics forfor how well we were doing and we broke
 it down into subclasses of you know maybe here's atype of uh
 of uh query that we're not doing well on then we try to fix thatearly on we started to realize that we
 were in an adversarial position right so we started thinking uhwell we're kind of like
 the card catalog in the library right so the books are here and we're off to theside
 and we're just reflecting what's there and then we realized every time we makea change the webmasters make a change
 and it's uh game theoretic and so we had to think not only ofis this the right move for us to make
 now but also if we make this move what's thecounter move going to be
 is that going to get us into a work worst place in which case we won't makethat move we'll make a different move


Speaker 0 :and did you find i mean i assume with
 the popularity and the growth of the internet that people were creating newcontent
 so you're almost helping guide the

Speaker 1 :creation yeah so that's certainly true
 right so we we definitely changed uh thestructure
 of the network right so if you think back you know in the in the very earlydays
 uh larry and sergey had the page rank paperand john kleinberg had this uh hubsan
 authorities model which says the web is made out ofthese uh hubs which will be
 my page of cool links about dogs or whateverand people would just list links uh and
 then there'd be authorities which were the ones uh thepage about dogs that most people link to
 that doesn't happen anymore people don't bother to say my page ofcool links
 because we took over that function right so sowe changed the way that worked did you


Speaker 0 :imagine back then that the internet
 would be as massively vibrant as it is todayi mean it was already growing quickly
 but it's just another i i don't know if you've ever if todayif you sit back and just look at the
 internet with wander the amount of content that'sjust constantly being created constantly
 being shared

Speaker 1 :unemployed yeah it's uh it's always been
 surprising to me i guess i'm not very good at predictingthe future in the future
 okay and i remember you know being a graduate student inin 1980 or so and uh you know we had the
 arpanet and then there was this uh proposal touh commercialize it and have this
 internet and this uh uh crazy senator gore thought that mightbe a good idea yeah and i remember
 thinking oh come on you can't you can't expect a commercial company tounderstand
 this technology they'll never be able to do it yeah okay we can have this dot-comdomain but it won't go anywhere
 so i was wrong al gore was right at the

Speaker 0 :same time
 the nature of what it means to be a commercial company has changed tooso google yeah isn't that it's founding
 is different than uh you know what companies were before ithink right so there's all these


Speaker 1 :uh business models that are so different
 than what was possible back then

Speaker 0 :so in terms of predicting the future
 what do you think it takes to build a systemthat approaches human level intelligence
 you've talked about of course that we you know we shouldn'tbe so obsessed about creating human
 level intelligence just create systems that are very usefulfor humans but what do you think it
 takes

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :to uh to uh yeah approach that level
 right

Speaker 1 :so certainly i don't think human level
 intelligence is one thing right so i think there's lots ofdifferent tasks lots of different
 capabilities i also don't think uh that should be thegoal right so i you know
 i wouldn't want to create a uh calculator that could do multiplicationat human levels right
 that would be a step backwards and so for many things we should be aiming farbeyond human level
 for other things maybe human level is a good level to aim atand for others we say well let's not
 bother doing this because we already have humans can take on those tasksso as you say i like to focus on what
 what's a useful tool and and in some cases being on humanlevel
 is an important part of crossing that threshold to make the tool usefulso we see in things like these uh
 personal assistants now that you get either on your phone or ona speaker that sits on the table
 you want to be able to have a conversation with those andand i think as an industry we haven't
 quite figured out what the right model is forwhat these things can do and we're
 aiming towards well you just have a conversation with them the way you canwith the person
 right but we haven't delivered on that model yetright so you can ask it what's the
 weather you can ask it play some nice songs uh anduh you know five or six other things and
 then you run out of stuff that it can do

Speaker 0 :in terms of a deep meaningful connection
 so you've mentioned the movie her as one of your favorite ai moviesdo you think it's possible for a human
 being to fall in love with an ai system ai assistant as you mentionedso taking this big leap from uh what's
 the weather to you know having a deep connection yeah ii think


Speaker 1 :uh as people that's what we love to do
 and uh i was at a a showing of her where we had a panel discussion and andsomebody asked me
 uh what other movie do you think her is similar toand my answer was uh life of brian
 which which is not a science fiction movie uhbut both movies are about wanting to
 believe in something that's not necessarily real

Speaker 0 :yeah by the way for people don't know
 it's monty python yeah yeah that's been brilliantly put right so i mean i think

Speaker 1 :that's just the way we are we
 we want to trust we want to believe we want to fall in loveand uh it doesn't necessarily take that
 much right so you know my kids uh fell in love withtheir teddy bear
 right and the teddy bear was not very interactive right so that's all usyeah pushing our feelings onto
 our devices and our things and i think that that's what we like to do so we'llcontinue to do that


Speaker 0 :so yeah as human beings will long for
 that connection and just ai has to uh do a little bit of work to uh to catchus in the other end


Speaker 1 :yeah and certainly you know if you can
 get to uh dog level a lot of people have investeda lot of uh
 love in their pets and their pets some

Speaker 0 :some people
 as i've been told in working with autonomous vehicles have invested a lotof love into their
 inanimate cars yeah so it really doesn't take muchso what is a good test


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :to linger on a topic that may be silly
 or a little bit philosophical what is a good test of intelligence in your view

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :is natural conversation like in the
 touring test a good a good test put another way what wouldimpress you yeah if you saw a computer
 do it these days yeah i mean i get impressed

Speaker 1 :all the time
 right but like really impressive you know go playinguh starcraft playing uh those are all
 pretty cool you know and i think uh sureconversation is important i think uh
 you know we sometimes have these tests where it's easy to foolthe system where you can have a chatbot
 that can have a conversation but you never uh itnever gets into a situation where it has
 to be deep enough that uh it really reveals itselfas being intelligent or not i think
 uh you know turing suggested that uh but i think if he were alive he'd sayyou know i didn't really mean that
 seriously right yeah and i think uh and you knowthis is just my opinion but but i think
 turing's point was not that uh this test of conversation is a good testi think his point was
 having a test is the right thing so rather thanhaving the philosopher say oh no ai is
 impossible you should say well we'll just have atest and then the result of that will
 will tell us the answer and it doesn't necessarily have to be a conversationtest
 that's right and coming up a new better

Speaker 0 :test as the technology evolves is
 probably the right way

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :do you worry as a lot of the general
 public does about not a lot but some vocaluh part of the general public about the
 existential threat of artificial intelligence solooking farther into the future as you
 said most of us are not able to predict muchso when shrouded in such mystery there's
 a concern of well you think you start thinking aboutworst case is that something that
 occupies your mind space much so i certainly think about

Speaker 1 :uh threats i think about uh dangers uh
 and i think uh any new technology uh has positives and negatives and if it'sa powerful technology
 it can be used for bad as well as for goodso i'm certainly not worried about uh
 the robot apocalypse the terminator type scenarios i amworried about
 change in employment and uh are we going to be able to react fastenough to deal with that
 i think we're you know we're already seeing it today where a lot of peopleare
 are disgruntled about uh the way income inequality is workingand uh and automation could help
 accelerate those kinds of problems i see powerful technologies canalways be used as weapons uh whether
 they're robots or drones or whatever uh some ofthat
 we're seeing due to ai a lot of it you don't need aiand i don't know what's uh what's a
 worse threat if it's an autonomous drone or it's uhcrispr technology becoming available or
 we have lots of threats to face and some of them involveai and some of them don't
 so the threats that technology presents

Speaker 0 :are you for the most part optimistic
 about technology also alleviating those threats so creating new opportunities orprotecting us from the more detrimental
 effects of these things yeah i don't

Speaker 1 :know it again it's hard to predict the
 future and uh yes as a success societyso far we've survived the nuclear
 systems and other things of course uh only societies that have survived arehaving this conversation so uh maybe
 that's a survivorship bias there yeah what problem stands out to you as

Speaker 0 :exciting challenging
 impactful to work on in the near future for yourselffor the community in broadly so i


Speaker 1 :you know we talked about these uh
 assistance in conversation i think that's a great areai think combining uh
 common sense reasoning uh with the power of data is a a great areain which application in in conversation


Speaker 0 :relation or just broadly just


Speaker 1 :in general yeah as a programmer i'm
 interested in uh programming tools both in terms ofuh you know the current systems we have
 today with with tensorflow and so on can we make themmuch easier to use for broader uh class
 of people and also can we apply uh machinelearning
 to the more traditional type of programming right soyou know when you go to google and you
 uh type in a query and you spell somethingwrong it says did you mean
 and the reason we're able to do that is because lots of other people made asimilar error and then they corrected it
 we should be able to go into our code bases and our bug fix spacesand when i type a line of code it should
 be able to say did you mean such and such if you typethis today you're probably going to
 type in this bug fix tomorrow yeah that's a really exciting

Speaker 0 :application of uh almost
 uh an assistant for the coding programming experience yeahat every level so
 i think i could safely speak for the entire ai communityfirst of all for uh thank you for the
 amazing work you've done uh certainly for the amazing work you'vedone with uh
 ai a modern approach book yep i think we're all looking forward very much forthe fourth edition and then the fifth
 edition and so on so uh peter thank you so much for
