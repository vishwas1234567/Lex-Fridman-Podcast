Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 Kevin Scott the CTO of Microsoft before

Speaker 1 :that he was the senior vice president of


Speaker 0 :engineering and operations at LinkedIn


Speaker 1 :and before that he oversaw mobile ads


Speaker 0 :engineering at Google he also has a
 podcast called behind the tech with Kevin Scott which I'm a fan of this was

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :a fun and wide-ranging conversation that
 covered many aspects of computing it happened over a month ago before the

Speaker 1 :announcement that Microsoft's investment
 open the eye that a few people have

Speaker 0 :asked me about I'm sure there'll be one
 or two people in the future they'll talk with me about the impact of that

Speaker 1 :investment this is the artificial
 intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it five starsin iTunes
 supported on a patreon or simply connect

Speaker 0 :with me on Twitter at lex friedman
 spelled fri d-m am and I'd like to give

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :a special thank you to Tom and a lot the
 big housing for their support of the podcast on patreon thanks Tom and alon

Speaker 1 :the-- hope I didn't mess up your last


Speaker 0 :name too bad your support means a lot
 and inspires me to keep the series going and now here's my conversation withKevin Scott you described yourself as a


Speaker 1 :kid in a candy store at Microsoft
 because of all the interesting projects that are going on can you uh try to dothe impossible task and give a brief
 whirlwind view of all the spaces that Microsoft is working in it was the

Speaker 0 :research and product if you include
 research it becomes even even more difficult so so like I think broadlyspeaking Microsoft's product portfolio
 includes everything from a big cloud business like a big set of SAS serviceswe have you know sort of the original or
 like some of what are among the original productivity software products thateverybody uses we have an operating
 system business we have a hardware this where we make everything fromcomputer mice and headphones high-end
 high-end personal computers and laptops we have a fairly broad ranging researchgroup where like we have people doing
 everything from economics research so like this is really a really smart youngeconomist Glenn Weil who like my group
 works with a lot who's doing this research on these things called radicalmarkets like he's written an entire
 entire technical book about about this whole notion of a radical market so likethe research group sort of spans from
 that human-computer interaction to artificial intelligence and we have a wehave github we have LinkedIn we have a
 search advertising and news business and and like probably a bunch of stuff thatI'm embarrassingly not recounting and in


Speaker 1 :this gaming to Xbox and so on yeah


Speaker 0 :gaming for sure like I was I was having
 a super fun conversation this morning with with Phil Spencer so when I was incollege there was this game that Lucas
 arts made called day of the tentacle that my friends and I played forever andlike we're you know doing some interest
 in collaboration now with the folks who made day of the tentacle and I was likecompletely nerding out with Tim Schafer
 like the guy who wrote a day of the tentacle this morning just a completefanboy which you know sort of it like
 happens a lot like you know Microsoft has been doing so much stuff it's suchbreadth for such a long period of time
 that you know like being CTO like most of the time my job is very very seriousand sometimes like I get to I get caught
 up and like how amazing it is to be able to have the conversations that I havewith the people I get to have them with


Speaker 1 :you had to reach back into the
 sentimental and what's the the wreck of radical markets and they and they had

Speaker 0 :economics so there the idea with radical
 markets is like can you come up with new market-based mechanisms -you know I think we have this we're
 having this debate right now like does capitalism work like free markets workcan the incentive structures that are
 built into these systems produce outcomes that are creating sort ofequitably distributed benefits for every
 member of society you know and I think it's a reasonable reasonable set ofquestions to be asking and so what Glenn
 and so like you know one motor thought they're like if you have doubts that thethat the markets are actually working
 you can sort of like tip towards like okay let's let's become more socialistand you know like have central planning
 and you know governments or some other central organization it's like making abunch of decisions about how you know
 sort of work gets done and you know like where the you know where the investmentsand where the outputs of those
 investments get distributed Glenn's notion is like lean more into like themarket-based mechanism so like for
 instance you know this is one of the more radical ideas like suppose that youhad a radical pricing mechanism for
 assets like real estate where you were you could be bid out of your positionand in in your home you know for
 instance so like if somebody came along and said you know like I've I can findhigher economic utility for this piece
 of real estate that you're running your your business and like then like youeither have to you know sort of bid to
 sort of stay or like the thing that's got the higher economic utility you knowsort of takes over the asset and which
 would make it very difficult to have the same sort of rent seeking behaviors thatyou've got right now because like if you
 did speculative bidding like you would you very quickly like lose a whole lotof money and so like the prices of the
 assets would be sort of like very closely index to like the value thatthey can produce and like because like
 you'd have this sort of real-time mechanism that would force you to sortof mark the value of the asset to the
 market then it could be taxed appropriately like you couldn't sort ofsit on this thing and say oh like this
 house is only worth ten thousand bucks when like everything around it is worthten million


Speaker 1 :let's finish so it's an incentive
 structure that where the prices matched the value much better yeah

Speaker 0 :so the Anglin does a much much better
 job than I do at selling and I probably picked the world's worst example youknow and and in but like in its it's
 intentionally provocative you know so like this whole notion like I you knowlike I I'm not sure whether I like this
 notion that like we could have a set of market mechanisms where I could get bitout of faith that was my property you
 know but but you know like if you're thinking about something like ElizabethWarren's wealth tax for instance like
 you would have I mean you'd be really interesting in like how you wouldactually set the the price on the assets
 and like you might have to have a mechanism like that if you put a taxlike that in place it's really


Speaker 1 :interesting that that kind of research
 at least tangentially is touching Microsoft Research yeahthe years really thinking broadly that


Speaker 0 :maybe you can speak to this connects to


Speaker 1 :AI so we have a candidate Andrew yang
 who kind of talks about artificial intelligence and the concern that peoplehave about art you know automations
 impact on society and arguably Microsoft is at the cutting edge of innovation inall these kinds of ways and so it's
 pushing AI forward how do you think about combining all our conversationstogether here with radical markets and
 socialism and innovation in a item that Microsoft is doing and then AndrewYang's worried that that that will that
 will result in job loss for the low and so on how do you think about that I

Speaker 0 :think it's sort of one of the most
 important shins and Technology like maybe even insociety right now about how is AI going
 to develop over the course of the next several decades and like what's it goingto be used for and like what what
 benefits will it produce and what negative impacts will it produce and youknow how who gets to steer this whole
 thing you know I'll say it at the highest level one of the real joys ofgetting to do what I do at Microsoft is
 Microsoft has this heritage as a platform company and so you know likeBill Bill's has this thing that he said
 a you know a bunch of years ago where you know the the measure of a successfulplatform is that it produces far more
 economic value for the people who build on top of the platform than is creativefor the the platform owner or builder
 and I think we have to think about AI that way like satellite form yeah it hasto like it has to be a platform that
 other people can use to build businesses to fulfill their creative objectives tobe entrepreneurs to solve problems that
 they have in their work and in their lives it can't be a thing where thereare a handful of companies sitting in a
 very small handful of city cities geographically who are making all thedecisions about what goes into the AIA
 and and and like and then on top of like all this infrastructure then build allof the commercially valuable uses for it
 so like I think like that's bad from a you know sort of you know economics andsort of equitable distribution of value
 perspective like you know sort of back to this whole notion of you know like dothe markets work but I think it's also
 bad from an innovation perspective because like I have infinite amounts offaith in human beings that if you you
 know give folks powerful tools they will go do interesting things and it's morethan just a few tens of thousands of
 people with the interesting tools it should be millions ofpeople with the tools so sort of like
 you know you think about the the steam engine and the late 18th century like itwas you know maybe the first large-scale
 substitute for human labor that we've built like a machine and you know in thebeginning when these things are getting
 deployed the folks who got most of the value from the steam engines were thefolks who had capital so they could
 afford to build them and like they built factories around them in businesses andthe experts who knew how to build and
 maintain them but access to that technology democratized over time likenow like like an engine is not a it's
 not like a differentiated thing like there isn't one engine company thatbuilds all the engines and all of the
 things that use engines are made by this company and like they get all theeconomics from all of that like never
 like fully democratize like they're probably you know we're sitting here inthis room and like even though they
 don't that they're probably things you know like the the MEMS gyroscope thatare in both of our float like there's
 like little engines you know sort of everywhere they they're just a componentand how we build the modern world like
 AI DS to get there yeah so that's a

Speaker 1 :really powerful way to think if we think
 of AI is a platform versus a tool that Microsoft owns as a platform thatenables creation yeah on top of it
 that's a way to democratize it that's really absolutely interesting actuallyand Microsoft in its history has been
 positioned well to do that and the you

Speaker 0 :know the tie back to the to this radical
 markets thing like the so my team has been working with Glenn on this andJaron Lanier actually did just so Jaron
 is the like the sort of father of virtual reality like he's one of themost interesting human beings on the
 planet like a sweet sweet guy and so Jaron and Glen and folks in my team havebeen working on this notion of data as
 labor or like they call it data dignity as well and so the the idea is that ifyou you know again going back to this
 you know sort of industrial analogy if you think about data is the raw materialthat is consumed by the machine of AI in
 order to do useful things then like we're not doing a really great job rightnow and having transparent marketplaces
 for valuing those data contributions so like and we all make them likeexplicitly like you go to LinkedIn you
 sort of set up your profile on LinkedIn like that's an explicit contributionlike you know exactly the information
 that you're putting into the system and like you put it there because you havesome nominal notion of like what value
 you're gonna get in return but it's like only nominal like you don't know exactlywhat value you're getting in return like
 service is free you know like it's low amount of like procedure and then you'vegot all this indirect contribution that
 you're making just by virtue of interacting with all of the technologythat's in your daily life and so like
 what Glen and Jaron and and this data Dignity team are trying to do is likecan we figure out a set of mechanisms
 that let us value those data contributions so that you could createan economy and like a set of controls
 and incentives that would allow people to like maybe even in the limit likeearn part of their living through the
 data that they're creating and like you can sort of see it in explicit waysthey're these companies like scale AI
 and like they're a whole bunch of them in in China right now that are basicallydata labeling companies so like you
 you're doing supervised machine learning you need you need lots and lots of labeltraining data and like those people are
 getting competent like who worked for those companies are getting compensatedfor their data contributions into the
 system and so that's easier to put a

Speaker 1 :number on their contribution because
 they're explicitly labeling they're correct but you're saying that we're allcontributing data in all kinds of ways
 and it's fascinating to start to explicitly try to put a number on it doyou think that's you that's possible I


Speaker 0 :don't know it's hard it really is
 because you know we don't have as much transparency asis I think we need in like how the data
 is getting used and it's you know super complicated like you know we we you knowI think it's technologists sort of
 appreciate like some of the subtlety there it's like you know the data thedata gets created and then it gets you
 know it's not valuable like the the data exhaust that you give off or the youknow the explicit data that I am putting
 into the system isn't value valuable it's super valuable atomically like it'sonly valuable when you sort of aggregate
 it together and you know sort of large numbers it's true even for these likefolks who are getting compensated for
 like labeling things like for supervised machine learning now like you need lotsof labels to train a you know a model
 that performs well and so you know I think that's one of the challenges it'slike how do you you know how do you sort
 of figure out like because this data is getting combined in so many ways likethrough these combinations like how the
 value is flowing yeah that's that's

Speaker 1 :that's tough yeah and it's fascinating
 that you're thinking about this and I wish I wasn't even going to thisconversation expecting the breadth of
 research really that Microsoft broadly is thinking about you are thinking aboutit Microsoft so if we go back to 89 when
 Microsoft released office or 1990 when they at least windows 3.0 house.the inyour view I know you weren't there the
 entire you know there was history but how is the company changed in the 30years since as you look at it now the


Speaker 0 :good thing is it's started off as a
 platform company like it's still a platform company like the parts of thebusiness that are like thriving and most
 successful or those that are building platforms like the mission of thecompany now is the missions change it's
 like changing a very interesting way so you know back in 89 90 like they werestill on the original mission which was
 like put a PC on every desk and in every home like in it wasbasically about democratizing access to
 this new personal computing technology which when Bill started the companyintegrated circuit micro processors were
 a brand-new thing and like people were building you know homebrew computers youknow from kits like the way people build
 ham radios right now yeah and I think this is sort of the interesting thingfor folks who build platforms in general
 Bill saw the opportunity there and what personal computers could do and it waslike it was sort of a reach like you
 just sort of imagined like where things were you know when they started thecompany versus where things are now like
 in success when you've democratized a platform it just sort of vanishes intothe platform you don't pay attention to
 it anymore like operating systems aren't a thing anymore like they're superimportant like completely critical and
 like you know when you see one you know fail like you you just you sort ofunderstand but like you know it's not a
 thing where you're you're not like waiting for you know the next operatingsystem thing in the same way that you
 were in 1995 right that's like in 1995 like you know we have Rolling Stones onthe stage with the windows 95 rollout
 like it was like the biggest thing in the world everybody was lined up for itthe way that people used to line up for
 iPhone but like you know eventually and like this isn't necessarily a bad thinglike it just sort of you know it the
 success is that it's sort of it becomes ubiquitous it's like everywhere and likehuman beings when their technology
 becomes ubiquitous they just sort of start taking it for granted so themission now that Satya Ari articulated
 five plus years ago now when he took over as CEO of the companya mission is to empower every individual
 and every organization in the world to be more successful and so you know againlike that's a platform mission and like
 the way that we do it now is is different it's like we have a hyperscale cloud that cloud or building our
 applications on top of like we have a bunch of AI infrastructure that peopleare building their AI applications on
 top of we have you know we have a productivity suite of software likeMicrosoft Dynamics which you know some
 people might not think is the sexiest thing in the world but it's like helpingpeople figure out how to automate all of
 their business processes and workflows and you know like help those businessesusing it to like grow and be more so so
 it's it's a much broader vision in a way now than it was back then like it wassort of very particular thing and like
 now like we live in this world where technology is so powerful and it's likesuch a basic fact of life that it you
 know that it it both exist and is going to get better and better over time or atleast more and more powerful over time
 so like you know what you have to do is a platform player is just much bigger

Speaker 1 :right there's so many directions in
 which you can transform you didn't mention mixed reality yeah you knowthat's yep that's that's probably early
 days or depends how you think of it but if we think on a scale of centuries justthe early days of mixed reality
 oh for sure and so yeah with hololens the Microsoft is doing some reallyinteresting work there do you touch that
 part of the effort what's the thinking do you think of mixed reality as aplatform to know sure when we look at


Speaker 0 :what the platform's of the future could
 be so like fairly obvious that like AI is one like you don't have to I meanlike that's you know you sort of say it
 like someone and you know like they get it but like we also think of the likemixed reality and quantum is like these
 two interesting you know potential

Speaker 1 :computing yeah okay so let's get crazy
 then so so you're talking about some futuristic things herewell the mixed reality Microsoft is
 really it's not even feature a stick is here it is incredible stuff and it in

Speaker 0 :look and it's heaven and it's having
 impact right now like one of the one of the more interesting things thishappened with NYX reality over the past
 couple of years that I didn't clearly see is that it's become the computingdevice for for folks who for doing their
 work who haven't used any computing device at all to do their work before sotechnicians and service folks and people
 who are doing like machine maintenance some factory floors so like they youknow but because they're mobile and like
 they're out in the world and they're working with their hands and you knowsort of servicing these like very
 complicated things they're they don't use their mobile phone and like theydon't carry a laptop with them and you
 know they're not tethered to a desk and so mixed reality like where it's gettingtraction right now where hololens is
 selling a lot of a lot of units is for these sorts of applications for theseworkers and it's become like I mean like
 the people love it they're like oh my god like this is like for them like thesame sort of productivity boost that you
 know like an office worker had when they got their first personal computer yeah

Speaker 1 :but you did mention it's really obvious
 AI as a platform but can we dig into it a little bit red how does a I begin toinfuse some of the products in Microsoft
 so currently providing training of for example neural networks in the cloud

Speaker 0 :yeah we're providing put pre train


Speaker 1 :models or just even providing computing
 resources whatever different inference that you want to do using you on thatworks yep well how do you think of AI
 infusing the as a platform that Microsoft can provide yeah I mean I

Speaker 0 :think it's it's super Android it's like
 everywhere and like we we run these we run these review meetingsnow where it's be and satya and like
 members of sathyas leadership team and like a cross-functional group of folksacross the entire company who are
 working on like either AI infrastructure or like have some substantial part oftheir of their product work using AI in
 some significant way now the important thing to understand is like when youthink about like how the AI is gonna
 manifest in like an experience for something that's gonna make it betterlike I think you don't want the a
 eyeness to be the first-order thing it's like whatever the product is and likethe thing that is trying to help you do
 like the AI just sort of makes it better and it you know this is a grossexaggeration but like i yet people get
 super excited about like where the AI is showing up in products and i'm like doyou get that excited about like where
 you using a hash table that code like it's just another just the tool it's avery interesting programming tool but
 it's sort of a like it's an engineering tool and so like it shows up everywhereso like we've got dozens and dozens of
 features now in office that are powered by like fairly sophisticated machinelearning our search engine wouldn't work
 at all if you took the machine learning out of it the like increasingly you knowthings like content moderation on our
 Xbox and X cloud platform you know when

Speaker 1 :you mean moderation to be like the
 recommenced it's like showing what you want to look at next no no it's like

Speaker 0 :anti-bullying so that's that so you use


Speaker 1 :your social network stuff they yeah deal


Speaker 0 :with yeah correct but it's like really
 it's targeted it's targeted towards a gaming audience so it's like a veryparticular type of thing where you know
 the the line between playful banter and like legitimate bullying is like asubtle one and like you have to like
 it's sort of tough like I have

Speaker 1 :I'd love to if we could dig into it
 because you're also you let the engineering efforts to LinkedIn yep andif we look at if we look at LinkedIn as
 a social network yeah and if we look at the Xbox gaming is the social componentsthe very different kinds of I imagine
 communication going on on the two platforms yeah right and the line interms of bullying and so on is different
 on the GUP platforms so how do you I mean in such a fascinating philosophicaldiscussion of where that line is I don't
 think anyone knows the right answer Twitter folks are under fire now Jack aTwitter for trying to find that line
 nobody knows what that line is but how do you try to find the line for you knowtrying to prevent abusive behavior and
 at the same time let people be playful and joke around and that kind of thing I

Speaker 0 :think in a certain way like even if you
 have what I would call vertical social networks it gets to be a little biteasier so like if you have a clear
 notion of like what your social network should be used for or like what you aredesigning a community around then you
 don't have as many dimensions to your sort of content safety problem as youknow as you do in a general purpose I
 mean so like on on LinkedIn like the whole social network is about connectingpeople with opportunity whether it's
 helping them find a job or to you know sort of find mentors or to you know sortof help them like find their next sales
 leave or to just sort of allow them to broadcast their their you know sort ofprofessional identity to their their
 network of peers and collaborators and you know sort of professional communitylike that is I mean in like in some ways
 like that's very very broad but in other ways it's sort of you know it's narrowand so like you can build a eyes
 like machine learning systems that are you know capable with those boundariesof making better automated decisions
 about like what is you know sort of inappropriate and offensive comments ordangerous comments or illegal content
 when you have some constraints you know same thing with the same thing with likethe gaming gaming social network
 sufferance it's like it's about playing games not having fun and like the thingthat you don't want to have happen on
 the platform it's why bullying is such an important thing like bullying is notfun and also you want to do everything
 in your power to encourage that not to happen and yeah I but I think it's it'ssort of a tough problem in general it's
 one where I think you know eventually we're gonna have to have some sort ofclarification from our policymakers
 about what it is that we should be doing like where the lines are because it'stough like you don't like in democracy
 right like you don't want you want some sort of democratic involvement likepeople should have a say in like where
 where the lines lines are drawn like you don't want a bunch of people making likeunilateral decisions and like we are in
 a we're in a state right now for some of these platforms where you actually dohave to make unilateral decisions where
 the policy-making isn't gonna happen fast enough in order to like preventvery bad things from happening but like
 we need the policy-making side of that to catch up I think is as quickly aspossible because you want that whole
 process to be a democratic thing not a you know not not some sort of weirdthing where you've got a non
 representative group of people making decisions that have you know likenational and global impact as


Speaker 1 :fascinating because the digital space is
 different than the physical space and which nations and governments wereestablished and so what policy looks
 like globally what bullying looks like globally what healthy communicationlooks like global is there's open
 question and we're offering and freaking it out

Speaker 0 :yeah I mean with you know sort of fake
 news for instance and deep fakes and

Speaker 1 :fake news generated by humans yeah so


Speaker 0 :even we can talk about defects like I
 think that is another like you know sort of very interesting level of complexitybut like if you think about just the
 written word right like we have you know we invented papyrus what's threethousand years ago where we you know you
 could sort of put put word on on paper and then five hundred years ago like wewe get the printing press like where the
 word gets a little bit more ubiquitous and then like you really really didn'tget ubiquitous printed word until the
 end of the nineteenth century when the offset press was invented and then youknow just sort of explodes and like you
 know the cross-product of that and the industrial revolutions need for educatedcitizens resulted in like this rapid
 expansion of literacy and the rapid expansion of the word but like we hadthree thousand years up to that point to
 figure out like how to you know like what's what's journalism what'seditorial integrity like what's you know
 what's scientific peer review and so like he built all of this mechanism tolike try to filter through all of the
 noise that the technology made possible to like you know sort of getting tosomething that society could cope with
 and like if you think about just the piece the PC didn't exist fifty yearsago and so in like this span of you know
 like half a century like we've gone from no digital you know no ubiquitousdigital technology to like having a
 device that sits in your pocket where you can sort of say whatever is on yourmind to like what would it Mary Heaven
 or mary meeker just released her new like slide deck last week you know we'vegot 50 percent penetration of the the
 internet to the global population like they're like three and a half billionpeople who are connected now it's it's
 like it's crazy crazy croelick inconceivable like howall of this happens so you know it's not
 surprising that we haven't figured out what to do yet but like I gotta like wegot a really like lean into this set of
 problems because like we basically have three millennia worth of work to doabout how to deal with all of this and
 like probably what yeah amounts to the next decade worth of time so since were

Speaker 1 :on the topic of tough tough you know
 tough challenging problems let's look at more on the tooling side in AI thatMicrosoft is looking at space
 recognition software so there's there's a lot of powerful positive use casesyeah for face recognition but there's
 some negative ones and we're seeing those in different governments in theworld so how do you how does Microsoft
 think about the use of face recognition software as a platform in governmentsand companies yeah how do we strike an
 ethical balance here yeah I think we've

Speaker 0 :articulated a clear point of view so
 Brad Smith wrote a blog post last fall I believe this sort of like outline likevery specifically what you know whatever
 what our point of view is there and you know I think we believe that there arecertain uses to which face recognition
 should not be put and we believe again that there's a need for regulation therelike the the government should like
 really come in and say that you know this is this is where the lines are andlike we very much wanted to like
 figuring out where the lines are should be a democratic process but in the shortterm like we've drawn some lines where
 you know we push back against uses of face recognition technology you knowlike this city of San Francisco for
 instance I think is completely outlawed any government agency from using facerecognition tech and like that may prove
 to be a little bit overly broad but for like certain law enforcement things likeyou you really III would personally
 rather be overly sort of cautious in terms of restricting use of it untillike we have you know
 to find a reasonable democratically determined regulatory framework for likewhere we we could and should use it and
 you know the the other thing there is like we've got a bunch of research thatwe're doing and a bunch of progress that
 we've made on on bias there and like there all sorts of like weird biasesthat these models can have like all the
 way from like the most noteworthy one where you know you may haveunderrepresented minorities who are like
 underrepresented in the training data and then you start learning like strangethings but like they're they're even you
 know other weird things like we've I think we've seen in the public researchlike models can learn strange things
 like all doctors or men for instance just yeah i mean so like it really is athing where it's very important for
 everybody who is working on these things before they push publish they launch theexperiment they you know push the code
 you know online or they even publish the paper that they are at least starting tothink about what some of the potential
 negative consequences are some of this stuff i mean this is where you know likethe deep fake stuff I find very
 worrisome just because there gonna be some very good beneficial uses of likeGann generated imagery and I and funny
 enough like one of the places where it's actually useful is we're using thetechnology right now to generate
 synthetic synthetic visual data for training some of the face recognitionmodels to get rid of the bias right so
 like that's one like super good use of the tech but likeyou know it's getting good enough now
 where you know it's gonna sort of challenge normal human beings ability tolike now you're just sort of say like
 it's it's very expensive for someone to fabricate a photorealisticfake video and like ganzar gonna make it
 fantastically cheap to fabricate a photorealisticfake video and so like what you assume
 you can sort of trust as true versus like be skeptical about is about tochange
 yeah and like we're not ready for it I don't think the nature of truth right

Speaker 1 :that's uh it's also exciting because I
 think both you and I probably would agree that the way to solve to take onthat challenge is with technology yeah
 right there's probably going to be ideas of ways to verify which which kind ofvideo is legitimate which kind of is not
 so to me that's an exciting possibility most most likely for just the comedicgenius that the internet usually creates
 with these kinds of videos yeah and hopefully will not result in any serious

Speaker 0 :harm yeah and it could be you know like
 I think we will have technology too that may be able to detect whether or notsomething's fake a real although yeah
 the the fakes are pretty convincing even like when you subject them to machinescrutiny but you know that we we also
 have these increasingly interesting social networks you know that are underfire right now
 for some of the bad things that they do like one of the things you could chooseto do with a social network is like you
 could you could use crypto and the networks to like have content signedwhere you could have a like full chain
 of custody that accompanied every piece of content so like when you're viewingsomething and like you want to ask
 yourself like how you know how much can I trust this like you can clicksomething and like have a verified chain
 of custody that shows like oh this is coming from you know from this sourceand it's like sign
 I like someone whose identity I trust yeah yeah I think having that you knowhaving that Chain of Custody like being
 able to like say oh here's this video like it may or may not have beenproduced using some of this deep fake
 technology but if you've got a verified Chain of Custody where you can sort oftrace it all the way back to an identity
 and you can decide whether or not like I trust this identity like oh no this isreally from the White House or like this
 is really from the you know the office of this particular presidentialcandidate or it's really from you know
 Jeff Weiner CEO of of LinkedIn or Satya Nadella CEO Microsoft like that mightthat might be like one way that you can
 solve some of the problems and so like that's not the super high tech likewe've had all of this technology forever
 and back but I think you're right like it has to it has to be some sort oftechnological thing because the the
 underlying tech that is used to create this isn't not going to do anything butget better over time and the genie is
 sort of out of the bottle there's no stuffing it back in and

Speaker 1 :there's a social component which i think
 is really healthy for a democracy where people be skeptical about the thing theywatch yeah in general so you know which
 is good skepticism in general is good and it's good content so deep fakes inthat sense of creating global skepticism
 about can they trust what they read it encourages further research I come fromthe Soviet Union where basically nobody
 trusted the media because you knew it was propaganda and that encouraged thatkind of skepticism encouraged further
 research about ideas yeah posters just trusting any onesource look I think it's one of the


Speaker 0 :reasons why the the you know the
 scientific method and our apparatus of modern science is so good like becauseyou don't have to trust anything like
 you like the whole notion of you know like modern science beyond the fact thatyou know this is a hypothesis and this
 is an experiment to test the hypothesis and you know like this is a peer reviewprocess for scrutinizing published
 results but like stuffs also supposed to be reproducible so like you know it'sbeen better
 by this process but like you also are expected to publish enough detail whereyou know if you are sufficiently
 skeptical of the thing you can go try to like reproduce it yourself and like I Idon't know what it is like I think a lot
 of Engineers are like this where like you know sort of this like your brain issort of wired for for scepticism like
 you don't just first order trust everything that you see an encounter andlike you're sort of curious to
 understand you know the next thing but like I think it's an entirely healthyhealthy thing and like we need a little
 bit more of that right now so I'm not a

Speaker 1 :large business owner so I'm just I'm
 just a huge fan of many of Microsoft products I mean I still actually interms of I generate a lot of graphics
 and images and I still use PowerPoint to do that it beats illustrator for me evenprofessional a sort of is this
 fascinating so I wonder what is the future of let's say windows and officelook like is do you see it I mean I
 remember looking forward to XP wasn't exciting yep when XP was released justlike you said I don't remember when 95
 was released but xp for me it was a big celebration and and 110 came out I waslike okay what's nice it's a nice
 improvement but yeah so what do you see is the future of these products and you

Speaker 0 :know I think there's a bunch of exciting
 I mean though in the office front there's going to be this like increasingproductivity winds that are coming out
 of some of these AI powered features that are coming like the products aresort of get smarter and smarter in like
 a very subtle way like there's not gonna be this Big Bang moment where you knowlike Clippy is gonna reimagined it's
 gonna wait a minute okay well have that wait wait waitClippy coming back in but quite


Speaker 1 :seriously
 so injection of AI there's not much or at least I'm not familiar sort ofassistive type of stuff going on inside
 the office products in like a clippie style aassistant personal assistant do you
 think that there's a possibility of the

Speaker 0 :future alright so I think they're a
 bunch of like very small ways in which like machine learning power andassistive things are in the product
 right now so there are there a bunch of interesting things like the autoresponse stuffs getting better and
 better and it's like getting to the point where you know it can auto respondwith like okay let you know this person
 is clearly trying to schedule a meeting so it looks at your calendar and itautomatically electrons to fines like a
 time in a space that's mutually interesting like we we have this notionof Microsoft search where it's like not
 just web search but it's like search across like all of your informationthat's sitting inside of like your
 office 365 tenant and like you know potentially in other products and likewe have this thing called the Microsoft
 graph that is basically a API federated at you know sort of like gets you hookedup across the entire breadth of like all
 of the you know like what were information silos before they got woventogether with the graph like that is
 like getting increasing with increasing effectiveness sort of plumbed into theinto some of these auto-response things
 where you're gonna be able to see the system like automatically retrieveinformation for you like if you know
 like I frequently send out you know emails to folks were like I can't find apaper or a document or whatnot there's
 no reason why the system won't be able to do that for you and like I think thethe its building towards like having
 things that look more like like a fully integrated you know assistant but likeyou'll have a bunch of steps that you
 will see before you like it will not be this like Big Bang thing where likeClippy comes back and you've got this
 like you know manifestation of you know like a fully fully powered assistantso I think that's that's definitely
 coming in like all of the you know collaboration co-authoring stuff'sgetting better you know it's like really
 interested like if you look at how we use like the office product portfolio atMicrosoft like more and more of it is
 happening inside of like teams as a canvas and like it's this thing whereyou know you've got collaboration is
 like at the center of the product and like we we built some like really coolstuff that's some of which is about to
 be open source that are sort of framework level things for doing fordoing co-authoring so in is there a


Speaker 1 :cloud component to that so on the web or
 is it I forgive me if I don't already know this but with office 365 we stillthe collaboration would do if you're
 doing word which still send the file around no advice yeah this is it

Speaker 0 :we're already a little bit better than
 that and like you know so the fact that you're unaware of it means we've got abetter job to do feel like helping you
 discover discover this stuff but yeah I mean it's already like got a huge hugeclock but and like part of you know part
 of this framework stuff I think we're calling it like I like we've beenworking on it for a couple years so like
 I know the the internal code name for it but I think when we launched it a billis called a fluid framework and but like
 what fluid lets you do is like you can go into a conversation that you'rehaving in teams and like reference like
 part of a spreadsheet that you're working on where somebody's like sittingin the Excel canvas like working on the
 spreadsheet with a you know chart or whatnot and like you can sort of embedlike part of the spreadsheet in the
 team's conversation where like you can dynamically update it and like all ofthe changes that you're making to the to
 this object are like you know coordinate and everything is sort of updating inreal time so you can be in whatever
 canvas is most convenient for you to get your work done so I out of my own sort

Speaker 1 :of curiosity is engineer I know what
 it's like to sort of lead a team of 10 50Engineers Microsoft has I don't know
 what the numbers are maybe fifty maybe sixty thousand engineers with a lot more

Speaker 0 :genius I don't know exactly what the
 number is it's a lot it's it's tens of thousands sites this is more than ten or

Speaker 1 :fifteen what I mean you've uh you've led
 different sizes mostly large size of Engineers what does it take to lead sucha large group into a continued
 innovation continue being highly productive and yet develop all kinds ofnew ideas and yet maintain like what
 does it take to lead such a large group of brilliant people I think the thing

Speaker 0 :that you learn as you manage larger and
 larger scale is that there are three things that are like very very importantfor big engineering teams like one is
 like having some sort of forethought about what it is that you're gonna bebuilding over large periods of time like
 not exactly like you don't need to know that like you know I'm putting all mychips on this one product and like this
 is gonna be the thing but like it's useful to know like what sort ofcapabilities you think you're going to
 need to have to build the products of the future and then like invest in thatinfrastructure like whether and I like
 I'm not just talking about storage systems or cloud api's it's also likewhat does your development process look
 like what tools do you want like what culture do you want to build around likehow you're you know sort of
 collaborating together to like make complicated technical things and so likehaving an opinion and investing in that
 is like it just gets more and more important and like the sooner you canget a concrete set of opinions like the
 better you're going to be like you can wing it for a while small scales likeyou know when you start a company like
 you don't have to be like super specific about it but like the biggest miseriesthat I've ever seen as an engineering
 leader are in places where you didn't have a clear enough opinion about thosethings soon enough and then you just
 sort of go create a bunch of technical debtand like culture debt that is
 excruciating ly painful to to clean up so like that's one bundle of things likethe other the other you know another
 bundle of things is like it's just really really important to like have aclear mission that's not just some cute
 crap you say because like you think you should have a mission but like somethingthat clarifies for people like where it
 is that you're headed together like I know it's like probably like a littlebit too popular right now but you've all
 her re book sapiens one of the central ideas and in his book is that likestorytelling is like the quintessential
 thing for coordinating the activities of large groups of people like once you getpast Dunbar's number and like I've
 really really seen that just managing engineering teams like you you can youcan just brute force things when you're
 less than 120 hundred fifty folks where you can sort of know and trust andunderstand what the dynamics are between
 all the people but like past that like things just sort of start tocatastrophic ly fail if you don't have
 some sort of set of shared goals that you're marching towards and so like eventhough it sounds touchy-feely and you
 know like a bunch of technical people will sort of balk at the idea that likeyou need to like have a clear like the
 missions like very very very important

Speaker 1 :you've always write write stories that's
 how our society that's the fabric that connects us all of us is these powerfulstories and that works for companies -
 and it works for everything like it mean

Speaker 0 :even down to like you know you sort of
 really think about like a currency for instance is a story a constitution is astory our laws or story I mean like we
 believe very very very strongly in them and thank God we dobut like they are there they're just
 abstract things like they're just words it's like we don't believe in themthey're nothing
 and in some sense those stories are

Speaker 1 :platforms and the kinds some of which
 Microsoft is creating right you have platforms on which we define the futureso last question what do you think if
 philosophical maybe bigger than you know Microsoftwhat do you think the next 20 30 plus
 years looks like for computing for technology for devices do you have crazyideas about the future of the world yeah


Speaker 0 :look I think we you know we're entering
 this time where we've got we have technology that is progressing at thefastest rate that it ever has and you've
 got you get some really big social problems like society scale problemsthat we have to we have to tackle and so
 you know I think we're gonna rise to the challenge and like figure out how tointersect like all of the power of this
 technology with all of the big challenges that are facing us whetherit's you know global warming whether
 it's like the biggest remainder of the population boom is in Africa for thenext 50 years or so and like global
 warming is gonna make it increasingly difficult to feed global population inparticular like in this place where
 you're gonna have like the biggest population boom I think we you know likeAI is gonna like if we push it in the
 right direction like you can do like incredible things to empower all of usto achieve our full potential and to you
 know like live better lives but like that also means focus on like some superimportant things like how can you apply
 it to health care to make sure that you know like air quality and cost oh and insort of ubiquity of health coverage is
 is better and better over time like that's more and more important every dayis like in the in the United States and
 like the rest of the industrialized were alsoin Europe China Japan Korea like you've
 got this population bubble of like aging working you know working aged folks whoare you know at some point over the next
 20-30 years they're gonna be largely retired and like you you're gonna havemore retired people than working age
 people and then like you've got you know sort of natural questions about who'sgonna take care of all the old folks and
 who's gonna do all the work and the the answers to like all of these sorts ofquestions like where you're sort of
 running into you know like constraints of the you know the the world and ofsociety has always been like what tech
 is gonna like help us get around this you know like when I was when I was akid in the seventies and eighties like
 we talked all the time about like oh like population boom population boomlike we're gonna like we're not gonna be
 able to like feed the planet and like we were like right in the middle of theGreen Revolution we're like this this
 massive technology driven increase in crop productivity like worldwide andlike some of that was like taking some
 of the things that we knew in the West and like getting them distributed to theyou know to the to the developing world
 and like part of it were things like you know just smarter biology like helpingus increase and like we don't talk about
 like yep overpopulation anymore because like we can more or less we sort offigured out how to feed the world like
 that's a that's a technology story and so like I'm super super hopeful aboutthe future and in the ways where we will
 be able to apply technology to solve some of these super challenging problemslike I've I've like one of the things
 that I I'm trying to spend my time doing right now is trying to get everybodyelse to be hopeful as well because you
 know back to the Harare like we we are the stories that we tell like if we youknow if we get overly pessimistic right
 now about like the the potential future of technology like we you know like wemay fail to fail to get all the things
 in place that we need to like have our best possible future and that kind of

Speaker 1 :hopeful optimism I'm glad that you have
 it because you're leading large groups of engineers that are actually definingthat are writing that story that are
 helping build that future which is super exciting and I agree with everything yousaid except I do hope cliff he comes
 back haha we miss him I speak for the peopleAlan thank you so much for talking to
 now thank you so much for having me it
