Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :Paulo Lara Lara she's a professor of
 stem cell and regenerative biology at Harvard University and is interested inunderstanding the molecular laws that
 govern the birth differentiation and assembly of the human brains cerebral

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :cortex she explores the complexity of
 the brain by studying and engineering

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :elements of how the brain develops this


Speaker 1 :was a fascinating conversation to me
 it's part of the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe onYouTube give it five stars and iTunes
 supported on patreon I simply connect with me on Twitter atLex Friedman spelled Fri D ma a.m. and
 I'd like to give a special thank you to

Speaker 0 :Amy Jeffress for support of the podcast


Speaker 1 :on patreon she's an artist you should
 definitely check out her Instagram and

Speaker 0 :love truth good three beautiful words


Speaker 1 :your support means a lot and inspires me


Speaker 0 :to keep the series going and now here's
 my conversation with Paola our Lada

Speaker 1 :you studied the development of the human
 brain for many years so let me ask you and out-of-the-box question first howlikely is it that there's intelligent
 life out there in the universe outside of Earth with something like the humanbrain so I could put it another way how
 unlikely is the human brain how difficult is it to build a thing throughthe evolutionary process well it has


Speaker 0 :happened here I on this planet once yes
 once so that simply tells you that it could of course happen again otherplaces is only a matter of probability
 what the probability that you would get a brain like the ones that we have likelike the human brain so how difficult is
 it to make the human brain it's pretty difficult but most importantly I guesswe know very little about how this
 process really happens and there is a reason for that actually multiplereasons for that most of what we know
 about how the mammalian brain so the brain of mammals developed comes fromstudying in labs other brains not our
 own brain the brain of mice for example but if I showed you a picture of a mousebrain and then you put it next to a
 picture of a human brain they don't look at all like each other so they're verydifferent and and therefore there is a
 limit to what you can learn about how the human brain is made by studying themouse brain the region there is a huge
 value and studying the mouse brain there are many things that we have learned butit's not the same thing


Speaker 1 :so in having studied the human brain or
 through the mouse and through other methodologies that we'll talk about doyou have a sense I mean you're one of
 the experts in the world how much do you feel you know about the brain and howmuch how often do you find yourself in
 awe of this mysterious thing yeah you

Speaker 0 :pretty much find yourself you know all
 the time it's an amazing process it's a processwhich by means that we don't fully
 understand at the very beginning of embryogenesisthe structure called the neural tube
 literally self-assembles and it happens in an embryo and it can happen also fromstem cells in a dish okay and then from
 there these stem cells that are present within the neural tube give rise to allof the thousands and thousands of
 different cell types per present in the brain through time right with theinteresting very intriguing interesting
 observation is that the time that it takes for the human brain to be madeit's human time meaning that for me and
 you it took almost nine months of gestation to build the brain and thenanother twenty years of learning
 postnatally to get the brain we have today that allows us to thisconversation a mouse takes twenty days
 or so too small for an embryo to be born and so and and so the brain is built ina much shorter period of time and the
 beauty of it is that if you take mouse stem cells and you put them in andculture - the brain the orbit the brain
 organoid that you get from a mouse is formed faster that if you took humanstem cells and put them in the dish and
 let them make a human brain organoid so

Speaker 1 :the very developmental process is


Speaker 0 :controlled by the speed of the species


Speaker 1 :which means it's by its own purpose it's
 not accidental or there is something in

Speaker 0 :that temporal it's very exactly that is
 very important for us to get the brain we have and we can speculate for whythat is you know it takes us a long time
 as as human beings after we're born to learn all the things that we have tolearn to have the adult brain it's
 actually 20 years think about it from when a baby is born or - when a teenagergoes through puberty to adults it's a


Speaker 1 :long time do you think you can maybe
 talk through the first few months and then on to thefirst 20 years and then for the rest of
 their lives what is the development of the humanbrain look like what are the different


Speaker 0 :stages at the beginning you have to
 build a brain right and the brain is made of cells what's the very beginning

Speaker 1 :which beginning I were talking in the


Speaker 0 :embryo as the embryo is developing in
 the womb in addition to making all of the other tissues of the embryo themuscle the heart the blood the embryo is
 also building the brain and it builds from a very simple structure called theneural tube which is basically nothing
 but a cube of cells that spans sort of the length of the embryo from the headall the way to the tail let's say of the
 embryo and then over in human means over many months of gestation from thatneural tube which contains stem
 cell-like cells of the brain you will make many many other building blocks ofthe brain so all of the other cell types
 there are many many different types of cells in the brain that will formspecific structures of the brain so you
 can think about embryonic development of the brain is just the time in which youare making the building blocks the cells


Speaker 1 :at the stem cells relatively homogeneous
 like uniform or they all different ok

Speaker 0 :good question it's exactly how it works
 you start with a more homogeneous perhaps more multipotent type of stemcell that most importantly means that it
 can it has the potential to make many many different types of other cells andthen with time these progenitors become
 more heterogeneous which means more diverse there are going to be manydifferent types of the stem cells and
 also they will give rise to progeny to other cells that are not themselves thatare specific cells of the brain that are
 very different from the mothers themselves and now you think about thisprocess of making cells from the stem
 cells over many many months of development for humans andand what you're doing you're building
 the cells they physically make the brain and then you arrange them in specificstructures that are present in the final
 brain so you can think about the embryonic development of the brain asthe time where you're building the
 bricks you're putting a bricks together to form buildings structures regions ofthe brain and where you make the
 connections between these many different type of cells especially nerve cellsneurons right that transmit action
 potentials and electricity I've heard

Speaker 1 :you also says somewhere I think correct
 me if I'm wrong that the order of the way this builds matters oh yes if you

Speaker 0 :are an engineer and you think about
 development you can think of it as well I could also take all the cells andbring them all together into a brain in
 the end but development is much more than that so the cells are made in avery specific order that subserve the
 final product that you need to get and so for example all of the nerve cellsthe neurons are made first and all of
 the supportive cells of the neurons like the glia is made later and there is areason for that because they have to
 assemble together in specific ways but you also may say well why don't we justput them all together in the end it's
 because as they develop next to each other they influence their owndevelopment so it's a different thing
 for a glia to be made alone in a dish then a glia be made in a glial cell bemade in a developing embryo with all
 these other cells surrounded they produce all these other signals first of

Speaker 1 :all that's mind-blowing that this
 development process from my perspective in artificial intelligence you oftenthink of how incredible the final
 product is the final product the brain but you just you're making me realizethat the final product is just is the
 the beautiful thing is the actual development and development process dowe know the code that drives that
 development do we have any sense first of all thank

Speaker 0 :you for saying that
 it's really the formation of the brain it's really its development thisincredibly choreograph dance that
 happens the same way every time each one of us builds the brain right and thatbuilds an organ that allows us to do
 what we're doing today right yeah that is mind blowing and this is whydevelopmental neurobiologists never get
 tired in that now you're asking about the code what drives this how is thisdone well it's you know millions of
 years of evolution of really fine-tuning gene expression programs that allowcertain cells to be made at a certain
 time and to be in to become a certain you know cell type but also mechanicalforces of pressure bending this embryo
 is not just it will not stay a tube this this brain for very long at some pointis tube in the front of the of the
 embryo will expand to make the primordium of the brain right now theythe forces that control that these cells
 feel and this is another beautiful thing at the very force that they feel whichis different from a week before a week
 ago will tell the cell oh you're being squished in a certain way begin toproduce these new genes because now you
 are at the corner or you are you know in a stretch of cells or whatever it is andthere so that mechanical physical force
 shapes the fate of the cell as well so nala chemical is also mechana mechanical

Speaker 1 :so from my perspective biology is this
 incredibly complex mess gooey mess so you're seeing mechanical forces howdifferent is a like a computer or any
 kind of mechanical machine that we humans build and the biological systemshave you been because you've worked a
 lot with biological systems are they as much of a mess as it seems from aperspective of an engineer mechanical


Speaker 0 :engineer yeah
 they are much more prone to taking alternative routes right so if you we goback to printing a brain versus
 developing a brain of course if you print a brain given that you start withthe same building blocks the same cells
 you could potentially print it the same way every time but that final brain maynot work the same way as a brain built
 during development does because the build very build very same buildingblocks that you're using developed in a
 completely different environment right there was not the environment of thebrain therefore they're going to be
 different just by definition so if you instead use development to be able tosay a brain organoid which maybe we'll
 be talking about in a future those

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :things are fascinating yes so if you if
 you use processes of development then you when you watch it you can see thatsometime things can go wrong in some
 organ weights and by wrong I mean different one organ way from the nextwell if you think about that embryo it
 always goes right so it's this development it's for as complexity as itis every time a baby is born has you
 know with very few exceptions so the brain is like the next baby but it's notthe same if you develop it in a dish and
 first of all is we don't even develop a brain you develop something much simplerin the dish but there are more options
 for building things differently which really tells you the evolution as hasplayed a really tight game here for how
 in the end the brain is built in vivo so

Speaker 1 :just a quick may be dumb question but it
 seems like this is not the building process is not a dictatorship it seemslike there's not a centralized like
 high-level mechanism that says ok this cell built itself the wrong way I'mgoing to kill it it seems like it's
 there's a really strong distributed mechanismis that is that in your sense for there


Speaker 0 :are a lot of there are a lot of
 possibilities right and if you think about for example different speciesbuilding their brain each brain is a
 little bit different so the brain of a lizard is very different from that of achicken from that of a you know one of
 us and so on and so forth and still is a brain but it was built differently ifstarting from stem cells that pretty
 much had the same potential but in the end evolution buildsdifferent brains in different species
 because that serves in a way the purpose of the species and the well-being ofthat organism and so there are many
 possibilities but then there is a way and you were talking about a code nobodyknows what the entire code of
 development is of course we don't we know bitten bits and pieces of veryspecific aspects of development of the
 brain what genes are involved to make a certain cell types out those two cellsinteract to make the next level
 structure that we might know but the entirety of it oh it's so well controlit's really mind-blowing so in the first


Speaker 1 :two months in the embryo or whatever the
 first few months so yeah the the building blocks areconstructed the actual the different
 regions of the brain I guess in the nervous system

Speaker 0 :well this continuous way longer than
 just the first few months so over the the very first in a few months you builda lot of the cells but then there is a
 continuous building of new cell types all the way through birth and then evenpost Natalie you know I don't know if
 you ever heard of myelin myelin is this shrub insulation that is build around acable some of the neurons so that the
 electricity can go really fast the front axons I guess the axons are called axonsexactly and and so as human beings we my
 alienate ourselves post Natalie a kid you know a six-year-old kid has barelystarted
 so making the mature oligodendrocytes which are the cells then eventually willwrap with the axons in to myelin and
 this will continue believe it or not until we are about you know 2530 yearsold so there is a continuous process of
 maturation and tweaking and additions and and also in response to what we do I

Speaker 1 :remember taking ap biology in high
 school and in the textbook it said that I'm going by memory here that scientistsdisagree on the purpose of myelin in in
 the brain is that is that's totally wrong so like it I guess it speeds upthe book okay might be wrong here but I
 guess it speeds up the electricity traveling down the axon or something

Speaker 0 :that's the most sort of canonical and
 definitely that's the case so you have to imagine an axon and you can thinkabout it as a cable or some type with
 electricity going through and what myelin does by insulating the outside Ishould say there are tracks of myelin
 and pieces of axons that are naked without my Elaine and so by having theinsulation the electricity instead of
 going straight through the cable it would jump over a piece of myelin rightto the next naked little piece and jump
 again and therefore you you know that's the idea that you go faster and it wasalways thought that in order to build a
 big brain a big nervous system in order to have a nervous system it can do verycomplex the type of things then you need
 a lot of myelin because you want to go fast with this information from point Ato point B well a few years ago maybe
 five years ago or so we discovered that some of the most evolved which means thenewest type of neurons that we have as
 non-human primates as as human beings in the top of our cerebral cortex whichshould be the neurons do some of the
 most complex things that we do well those F axons that have very littlemyelin and they have very interesting
 way in which they put the smiling on theiraxles you know a little piece here then
 a long track with no mining another chunk there and some don't have miningat all so now you have to explain where
 we're going with evolution and if you think about it perhaps as an electricalengineer when I looked at it I initially
 thought and I'm a developmental neurobiology I thought maybe this iswhat we see now but if we give evolution
 another few million years we see a lot of myelin on these neurons - but Iactually think now that that's instead
 the future brain less myelin am i allow for more flexibility on what you do withyour actions and therefore more
 complicated and unpredictable type of functions which is also a bit

Speaker 1 :mind-blowing so it seems like it's
 controlling the timing of the signal so they're in the timingyou can encode a lot of yes information
 yeah and so the brain I mean the

Speaker 0 :chemistry of that little piece of axon
 perhaps is a dynamic process where the myelin can move now you see how manylayers of variability you can add and
 that's actually really good if you're trying to to come up with anew function or a new capability or
 something unpredictable in a way so

Speaker 1 :we're gonna jump around a little bit but
 the old question of how much is nature and how much is nurture in terms of thisincredible thing after the development
 is over we seem to be kind of somewhat smart intelligent cognitionconsciousness all these things are just
 incredible ability reasons so on emerge in your sense how much is in thehardware in the nature and how much is
 in the nurture has learned through with our parents to interact in the

Speaker 0 :environment so on it's really both right
 if you think about it so we are born with the brain as babies there has mostof his South and most of structures and
 we'll take a few years to you know to grow to add more to be better but reallythen we have this 20 years of
 interacting with the environment around us and so what that brain that was soyou know perfectly built or imperfectly
 built due to our genetic cues will then be used to incorporate the environmentin its further maturation and
 development and so your experiences do shape your your brain I mean we knowthat like if you know you and I may have
 had a different childhood or a different we have been going to different schoolswe have been learning different things
 and our brain is a little bit different because of that we behave differentlybecause of that and and so especially
 postnatally experience is extremely important we are born with a plasticbrain what that means it's a brain it is
 able to change in response to stimuli they can be sensory so perhaps some ofthe most illuminating studies that were
 done were studies in which the sensory organs were now working right if you areborn with eyes that don't work then your
 very brain that no piece of the brain that normally would process vision thevisual cortex develops postnatally
 differently and it might be used to do something different right so the most

Speaker 1 :extreme the plasticity of the brain I
 guess is the magic hardware that it and then it's it's flexibility in all formsis what enables the learning yes Natalie
 can you talk about organoids what are they yes and how can you usethem to help us understand the brain and
 the development of the brain this is

Speaker 0 :very very important so the first thing
 I'd like to say please keep this in the video the first thing I'd like to say isthat an organ or a brain organoid is not
 the same as a brain okay it's a fundamental distinction it'sa system a cellular system that one can
 develop in the culture dish starting from stem cells that will mimicsome aspects of the development of the
 of the brain but not all of it they are very small maximum they become about youknow four to five millimeters in
 diameter they are much simpler than than our brain of course by yet they are theonly system where we can literally watch
 a process of human brain development unfold and by watch I mean study itremember when I told you that we can't
 understand everything about development our own brain by studying a mouse wellwe can study the actual process of
 development of the human brain because it all happens in utero so we will neverhave access to that process ever and
 therefore this is our next best thing like a a bunch of stem cells that can becoaxed into starting a process of neural
 tube formation remember that cube that is made by the embryo early on and fromthere a lot of the cell types that are
 present within within the brain and you can simply watch it and study but youcan also think about diseases where
 development of the brain does not proceed normally right properly thinkabout neurodevelopmental diseases there
 are many many different types think about all these own spectrum disordersthere are also many different types of
 autism so there you could take a stem cell which really means either a sampleof blood or a sample of skin from the
 patient make a stem cell and then with that stem cell watch a process offormation of a brain organ with of their
 person the person with that genetics with that genetic code in it and you canask what is this genetic code doing to
 some aspects of development of the brain for the first time you may come tosolutions like what cells are involved
 in autism so right so many questions

Speaker 1 :around this so if you take
 this human stem cell for that particular person with that genetic code how andyou try to build an organized yeah how
 often will it look similar what's the produce ability yes or how

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :much variability its website of that


Speaker 0 :yeah so there is much more variability
 in building organoids than there than there is in buildingbrain it's really true that the majority
 of us when we are born as babies our brains look a lot like each other thisis the magic that the embryo does where
 it builds a brain in the context of a body and and there is very littlevariability there there is disease of
 course but in general little variability when you build an organizer you know wedon't have the full code for how this is
 done and so in part the organoid somewhat built itself because there aresome structures of the brain that the
 cells know how to make and another part comes from the investigator thescientist add in to the media factors
 that we know in the mouse for example would foster a certain step ofdevelopment but it's very limited and so
 as a result the kind of product you get in the end is much more reduction isthis much more simple than what you get
 in vivo it mimics early events of development as of today and it doesn'tbuild very complex type of anatomy and
 structure does not as of today which happens is that in in vivo and also thevariability that you see one organ or to
 the next tends to be higher than we'll compare an

Speaker 1 :embryo to the next so okay then the next
 question is how hard and maybe another flip side of that expensive is it to gofrom one stem cell to an organized yeah
 how many can you build and like this sounds very complicated

Speaker 0 :it's work definitely and it's money
 definitely but you can really grow a very high number of this organoids youknow can go
 I told you the maximum they become about five millimeters in diameter so this isabout the size of a of a tiny tiny you
 know raising or perhaps the seed of an apple and so you can grow 50 to 100 ofthose inside one big bioreactors which
 are these flasks where the media provides nutrients for the organoidsso the problem is not to grow more or
 less of them it it's really to figure out how to grow them in a way that theyare more and more reproducible for
 example orgonite organize so they can be used to study a biological processbecause if you have too much variability
 then you never know if what you see is just an exception or really the rule so

Speaker 1 :what is an organize look like are there
 different neurons already emerging is there you know well first can you tellme what kind of neurons are there yes
 are they sort of all the same are they not all the same as to how much do weunderstand and how much of that variance
 if any can exist in organoids yes so you

Speaker 0 :could grow I told you that the brain has
 different parts so the cerebral cortex is on top at the top part of the brainbut there is another region called the
 striatum that is below the cortex and so on and so forth all of these regionshave different types of cells in the
 actual brain ok and so scientists have been able to grow organoids that maymimic some aspects of development of
 these different regions of the brain and so we are very interested in the

Speaker 1 :cerebral cortex that's the coolest part


Speaker 0 :you're talking if we didn't have a
 cerebral cortex it's also I like to think the part of the brain that reallytruly makes us human the most evolved in
 recent evolution and so in the attempt to make the cerebral cortex and byfiguring out a way to have this
 organoids continue to grow and develop for extended periods of times much likeit happens in the real embryo months and
 months in culture there you can see that there many differenttypes of neurons of the cortex appear
 and at some point also the astrocytes to the glia cells of the cerebral cortex

Speaker 1 :also appear what are these the


Speaker 0 :astrocytes are not neuron so they're not
 nerve cells but they they play very important roles one important role is tosupport the neuron but of course they
 have much more active type of roles are very important for example to make thesynapses which are the point of contacts
 and communication between two neurons they all that chemistry fun happens

Speaker 1 :between the synapses happens because of
 these cells are they the medium in which

Speaker 0 :it happens because of the interactions
 happens because you are making the cells and they have certain propertiesincluding the ability to make you know
 neurotransmitters which are the chemicals that are secreted to thesynapses including the ability of making
 this axons grow with their growth cones and so on and so forth and then you haveother cells around there that release
 chemicals or touch the neurons or interact with them in different ways toreally foster this perfect process in
 this case of synaptogenesis and this does happen within within organized so

Speaker 1 :the mechanical and the chemists and
 chemical stuff happens yes the

Speaker 0 :connectivity between neurons this video
 why is not surprising because scientists have been culturing neurons forever andwhen you take a new don't even a very
 young one and you culture it eventually finds another cell or another neuron totalk to it will form a synapse are we


Speaker 1 :talking about Meisner on my human neuron
 it doesn't matter both so you can culture and you out like a single neuronand give it a little friend
 and it starts interacting yes so neurons

Speaker 0 :are able to it sounds it's more simple
 than what it may sound to you neurons have molecular properties and structuralproperties allow them to really
 communicate with other cells and so if you put not one neuron but if you putseveral neurons together chances are
 that they will form synapse

Speaker 1 :is with each other okay great so an


Speaker 0 :organized not a brain but but uh there's


Speaker 1 :some it's able to especially what you're
 talking about mimic some properties of the cerebral cortex for example so whatwhat can you understand about the brain
 by studying an organize of a cerebral cortex

Speaker 0 :I can literally study how all this
 incredible diversity of cell type all these many many different classes ofcells how are they made how do they look
 like what do they need to be made properly and what goes wrong if now thegenetics of that stem cell that I used
 to make the organ we came from a patient with a neurodevelopmental disease can Iactually watch for the very first time
 what may have gone wrong years before in this kid when its own brain was beingmade think about that loop in a way it's
 a little tiny rudimentary window into the past into the time when that brainin a kid they had this you know
 developmental disease was being made and I think that's unbelievably powerfulbecause today we have no idea of what
 cell types we barely know what brain regions are affected in these diseasesnow we have an experimental system that
 we can study in the lab and we can ask what are the cells affected when duringdevelopment things went wrong what are
 the molecules among the many many different molecules that that controlbrain development which ones are the
 ones they're really messed up here and we want perhaps to fix and what isreally the final product is it a less
 strong kind of circuit and brain is it a brain that lacks a cell type is it whatis it because then we can think about
 treatment and and care for these patients that is informed rather thanjust based on current diagnostics so how


Speaker 1 :hard is it to detect through the
 development of process the super-exciting mech tooljust to see how different conditions
 develop how hard is it to detect it wait a minute this is abnormal developmentyeah that's how hard is how much signal
 is there how much of it is is it a mess

Speaker 0 :because things can go wrong multiple
 levels right you could have a cell that is born and built but then doesn't workproperly or a self is not even born or a
 cell does interact with other cell differently and so on and so forth sotoday we have technology that we did not
 have even five years ago that allows us to look for example at the molecularpicture of a cell of a single cell in a
 sea of cells with high precision and so that molecular information where youcompare many many single cells for the
 genes they produce between a control individual and an individual with andyour developmental disease that may tell
 you what is different molecular Li or you could see that some cells are noteven made for example or that the
 process of maturation of the cells may be wrong there are many different levelshere and and we can study these cells at
 the molecular level but also we can use the organ is to ask questions about theproperties of the neurons the functional
 properties how they communicate with each other out they respond to astimulus and so on and so forth and we
 may get at abnormalities their detectors

Speaker 1 :so how early is this work in a maybe in
 the history of science so I mean like so

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :if you were to if you and I time travel
 a thousand years into the future organize seem to be maybe I'mromanticizing the notion but you're
 building not a brain but something that has properties of a brain so you itfeels like you might be getting close to
 in the building process thought to build us to understandso how how far are we in this
 understanding process of development

Speaker 0 :thousand years from now it's a long time
 from now so if this planet is still gonna be here and a thousand years from

Speaker 1 :now you know like they write a book
 obviously you there'll be a chapter

Speaker 0 :about you that science fiction book
 today today but I mean I guess where we

Speaker 1 :really understood very little about the
 brain a century ago was big fan in high school reading Freud and so on and stillAM of Psychiatry I would say we still
 understand very little about the functional aspect of just yeah but howin the history of understanding the
 biology of the brain the development how far are we alone it's a very good

Speaker 0 :question and so this is just of course
 my opinion I think that we did not have technology even ten years ago or 20certainly not 20 years ago to even think
 about experimentally investigating the development of the human brain so we'vedone a lot of work in science to study
 the brain or many other organisms now we have some technologies which I'll spellout that allow us to actually look at
 the real thing and look at the brain at the human brain so what are thesetechnologies there is been huge progress
 in stem cell biology the moment someone figured out how to turn a skin cell intoan embryonic stem cell basically and
 that out that embryonic stem cell could begin a process of development again tocorrect for example make a brain there
 was a huge and you know advance and in fact there was a Nobel Prize for thatthat started the field really of using
 stem cells to build organs now we can build on all the knowledge ofdevelopment that we build over the many
 many many years to say how do we make the stem cells now make more and morecomplex aspects of development of the
 human brain so this field is younger the field of brain organics but is movingfaster and it's moving fast in a very
 serious way that is rooted in labs with the right ethical frameworkand and really building on you know
 solid science for reality is and what is not and but it will go faster and itwill be more and more powerful we also
 have technology that allows us to basically study the properties of singlecells across many many millions of
 single cells which we didn't have perhaps five years ago so now with thateven an organ or that has millions of
 cells can be profiled in a way looked at very very high resolution the singlecell level to really understand what is
 going on and you could do it in multiple stages of development and you can buildyour hypothesis and so on and so forth
 so it's not going to be a thousand years it's gonna be a shorter amount of timeand I see this as sort of a an
 exponential growth of this field enabled by these technologies that we didn'thave before
 and so we're gonna see something transformative that we didn't see at allin the prior thousand years so I


Speaker 1 :apologize for the crazy sci-fi questions
 but the developmental process is fascinating to watch and study but howfar are we away from and maybe how
 difficult is it to build not just an organ or but a human brain okay from us

Speaker 0 :themself yeah first of all that's not
 the goal for the majority of the serious scientists that work on this because youdon't have to build the whole human
 brain to make this model useful for understanding of the brain develops orunderstanding disease you don't have to
 build the whole thing

Speaker 1 :so let me is let me just comment on that
 it's fascinating it shows to me the difference between you and I is you'reactually trying to understand the beauty
 of the human brain and to use it to really help thousands or millions ofpeople disease and so on right from an
 artificial intelligence but we're trying to build systems that we can put inrobots and try to create systems that
 have echoes of the intelligence about reasoning about the worldnavigating the world its


Speaker 0 :its different objectives I think we


Speaker 1 :operate in size fix a little bit but so
 so on that point of building a brain even though that is not the focus orinterest perhaps of the community how
 difficult is it is it truly science fiction at this point I think the field

Speaker 0 :will progress like I said and that the
 system will be more and more complex in a way right but there are propertiesthat emerge from the human brain they
 have to do with the mind they may have to do with conscious name I have to dowith intelligence or whatever that we
 don't really don't don't understand even now they can emerge from an actual realbrain and therefore we cannot measure or
 study in an organized so so I think that this field many many years from now maylead to the building of better neural
 circuits of you know that really are built out of understanding about thisprocess really works and it's hard to
 predict how complex this really will be I really don't think we're so far fromit makes me laugh really it's really
 that far from building the human the human brain but you're gonna be buildingsomething that is you know always a bad
 version of it but that may have really powerful properties and might be able toyou know respond to stimuli or or be
 used in in certain context and this is why I really think that there is noother way to do this science but within
 the right ethical framework because where you're going with this is also youknow we can talk about science fiction
 and write that book and we could today but this work happens in a specificethical framework that we don't decide
 just a scientist but also as a society

Speaker 1 :so the ethical framework here is a
 fascinating one is the complicated one do you have a sense a grasp of how wethink about ethically of building
 organoids from human stem cells to understand thebrain it seems like a tool for helping
 potentially millions of people cure diseases are at least start the cure byunderstanding it but is there more is
 there gray areas that are at the that we have to think about ethically absolutely

Speaker 0 :we must think about that every
 discussion about the ethics of this needs to be based on actual data fromthe models that we have today and from
 the ones that we will have tomorrow so it's a continuous conversation it's notsomething that you decide now today
 there is no issue really very simple models they that clearly can help you inmany ways without much much think about
 but tomorrow we need to have another conversation and so on and so forth andso the way we do this is to actually
 really bring together constantly a group of people that are not only scientistsbut also bioethicists the lawyers
 philosophers psychiatrist and so on as a psychologist and so on and so forth todecide as a society really what we
 should and what we should not do so that's the way to think about the ethicsnow I also think though that as a
 scientist I have a moral responsibility so if you if you think about howtransformative it could be for
 understanding and curing a neuropsychiatristto be able to actually watch and study
 and treat with drugs the very brain of the patient that you are trying to studyhow transformative at this moment in
 time this could be we couldn't do it five years ago we could do it now right

Speaker 1 :if taking of a particular patient


Speaker 0 :patient and make an organ or for a
 simple and you know different from the from the human brain he still is hisprocess of brain development with his
 with his or her genetics and we could understand perhaps what is going wrongperhaps we could use as a platform as a
 cellular platform to screen for drugs to fix a processand so on and so forth right so we could
 do it now we couldn't do it five years ago should we not do it what is the

Speaker 1 :downside of doing it I don't see a


Speaker 0 :downside if you would but if we invited


Speaker 1 :a lot of people yes if I'm sure there
 would be somebody who would would argue against it what would be the devil'sadvocate argument yeah


Speaker 0 :so it's exactly perhaps what you eluded
 it with your question that you are making as enabling you know some someprocess of formation of the brain that
 could be misused at some point or there could be showing properties thatethically we don't want to see in a
 tissue so today today this is not an issue and so you you just gaindramatically from the science without
 because the system is so simple and and so different in a way from from theactual brain but but because it is the
 brain we have an obligation to really consider all of this right and againit's it's a balanced conversation where
 we should put disease and betterment of humanity also on that plate what do you

Speaker 1 :think at least historically there were
 some politicization of embryonic stem cells a stem cell research do you stillsee that out there is there is that
 still a force that we have to think about especially in this largerdiscourse that we're having about the
 role of science in at least American society yeah this is a very good

Speaker 0 :question it's very very important I see
 a very central role for scientist to inform decisions about what we should orshould not do in society and this is
 because the scientists have the first-hand look and understanding ofreally the work that they are doing and
 again this varies depending on what we're talking about hereso now we're talking about Brian
 organoids I think the scientists need to be part of that conversation about whatis will be allowed in the future or not
 allowed in the future to do with the system and I think it's that is veryvery important because they bring
 reality of data to the conversation and and and so they should have a voice so

Speaker 1 :data should have a voice


Speaker 0 :it needs to have a voice because a not
 only data we should also be good at communicating with non scientists thedata so there has been often time there
 is a lot of discussion and you know excitement and fights about certaintopics just because of the way they are
 described I'll give you an example if I call that the same cellular system wejust talked about a brain organoid or if
 i called it a human mini brain your reaction is going to be very differentyes to this and so the way the systems
 are described I mean we and journalists alike need to be a bit careful that thisdebate is a real debate and inform
 burial data that's all I'm asking and

Speaker 1 :yeah the language matters here so I work
 on autonomous vehicles and their the use of language could it could it coulddrastically change the interpretation
 and the way people feel about what is the right way to proceed forwardyou are as I've seen from a presentation
 you're a parent as I show a couple pictures of your son is it just the oneto sign a daughter so what have you
 learned from the human bracing two of

Speaker 0 :them what have I learned I've learned
 that children really have this amazing plastic minds right that we have aresponsibility to you know foster their
 growth in good healthy ways that keep them curious that keepsadventures that doesn't raise them in
 fear of things but also respecting who they are which is in part you knowcoming from their genetics we talked
 about my children are very different from each other despite the fact thatthey're the product of the same two
 parents I also learned that what you do for them comes back to you like you knowif you're a good parent you're gonna
 most of the time have you know perhaps a decent kids at the end what do you think

Speaker 1 :just a quick comment what what do you
 think is the source of that difference it's often the surprising thing forparents is it can't believe that our
 kids oh they're so different yet they came from the same parents well they are

Speaker 0 :genetically different even they came
 from the same two parents because the mixing of gametes I mean you know weknow these genetics creates every time a
 genetically different individual which will have a specific mix of genes thatis a different mix every time from the
 two parents and so so they're not twins so they are genetically different is

Speaker 1 :that a little bit of variation as you
 said really from a biological perspective the brains look pretty

Speaker 0 :similar well so let me clarify that so
 the genetics you have the genes that you have at that play that beautifulorchestrated symphony of development
 different genes will play it slightly differently it's like playing the samepiece of music but with the different
 orchestra and a different director right the music will not come out it will bestill a piece by the same you know
 author but it will come out differently if it's played by the high schoolorchestra instead of and so you are born
 superficially with the same brain it has the same cell types similar patterns ofconnectivity but the properties of the
 cells and how the cells we then react to the environment as you experience yourword will be also shaped by pujan
 ethically you are speaking just as a parentthis is not something that comes from my
 work I think you can tell a birth differently that they have a differentpersonality in a in a way right so both
 is needed the genetics as well as the nurturing afterwards so you are one

Speaker 1 :human with a brain instead of living
 through the whole mess of it the human condition full of love maybe fearultimately mortal how has studying the
 brain changed the way you see yourself and you look in the mirror when youthink about your life the fear is the
 love when you see your own life your own mortality yeah that's a very good

Speaker 0 :question it's almost impossible to
 dissociate sometime for me some of the things we do or some of the things thatother people do from oh that's because
 that part of the brain is working in a certain way or thinking about a teenageryou know going through teenage years and
 being at I'm funny in the way they think and impossible for me not to think it'sbecause they're going through this
 period of time called critical periods of plasticity where their synapses arebeing eliminated here and there and
 they're just confused and so from that comes perhaps a different take on thebehavior or maybe I can justify
 scientifically in some sort of way I also look at humanity in general and Iam amazed by what we can do and the kind
 of ideas that we can come up where then I cannot stop thinking about how thebrain is continuing to evolve I don't
 know if you do this but I think about the next brain sometimes what are wegoing with it's like what are the
 features of this brain that you know evolution is really plain wait to get usyou know in the future the new brain
 it's not over right it's it's a work in progress

Speaker 1 :so let me just a quick comment on
 do you see do you think there's a there's a lot of fascination and hopefor artificial intelligence of creating
 artificial brains you said the next brain when you imagine over a period ofa thousand years the evolution of the
 human brain do you sometimes envisioning that future see an artificial oneartificial intelligence as it is hoped
 by many not hoped thought by many people would be actually the next evolutionarystep in the development yeah yeah I


Speaker 0 :think in a way that will happen right
 it's almost like a part of the way we evolved we evolved in the world that wecreated that we interact with the shape
 has as we grow up and so on and so forth sometimes I think about something thatmay sound silly but think about the use
 of of cell phones part of me thinks that somehow in their brain there will be aregion of the cortex that is this much
 attuned to that tool and and this comes from a lot of studies in in in modelorganisms where really the cortex
 especially adapts to the kind of things you have to do so if we need to move ourfingers in a very specific way we have a
 part of our cortex that allows us to do this kind of very precise movement in anowl that has to see very very far away
 with big eyes the visual cortex very big it's the brain attuned to yourenvironment so the brain will attune to
 the to the technologies that we will have and will be shaped by it

Speaker 1 :so the cortex very well maybe we shaped
 by it in the artificial intelligence it may merge with it they may get a envelop

Speaker 0 :it and adjust if it's not you know
 emerge of the kind of oh let's have a synthetic element together with abiological one the very space around us
 the fact for example think about we put on some goggles of virtual reality andwe physically are surfing the ocean
 right like I've done it and you have all these emotions that come to you youbrain placed you in that reality and it
 was able to do it like that just by putting the goggles on it didn't takethousands of years of adapting to this
 the brain is plastic so adapts to new technology so you could do it from theoutside by simply hijacking some sensory
 capacities that we have so clearly over you know recent evolution the cerebralcortex has been a part of the brain that
 has known the most evolution so we have put a lot of chips on evolving thisspecific part of the brain and the
 evolution of cortex is plasticity it's this ability to change in response tothings so yes they will integrate that
 we want it or not well there is no

Speaker 1 :better way to end it Paula thank you so
