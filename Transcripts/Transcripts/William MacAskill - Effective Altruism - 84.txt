Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 William McCaskill he's a philosopher ethicists and one of the originators ofthe effective altruism movement his
 research focuses on the fundamentals of effective altruism are the use ofevidence and reason to help others but
 as much as possible with our time and money with a particular concentration onhow to act
 given moral uncertainty he's the author of doing goodbetter effective altruism and a radical
 new way to make a difference he is a co-founder and the president of thecenter of effective altruism CEA that
 encourages people to commit to donate at least 10 percent of their income to themost effective charities he co-founded
 80,000 dollars which is a nonprofit that provides research and advice on how youcan best make a difference through your

 my conversation with William McCaskill what is utopia for humans and all lifeon Earth look like for you that's a


Speaker 0 :great question
 what I want to say is that we don't know and the Utopia we want to get to is anindirect one that I call the long
 reflection so period of post-scarcity no longer have the kind of urgent problemswe have today but instead can spend
 perhaps it's tens of thousands of years debating engaging ethical reflection inorder before we take any kind of drastic
 lock in actions like spreading to the Stars and then we can figure out what islike what is of kind of moral value a


Speaker 1 :long reflection as a that's a really
 beautiful term so if we look at Twitter for just a second do you think humanbeings are able to reflect in a
 productive way I don't mean to make you sound bad because there is a lot offights and politics and division in our
 discourse maybe if you zoom out it actually is civilized discourse it mightnot feel like it but when you zoom out
 but so I don't want to say that Twitter is not civilized discourse I actuallybelieve it it's more civilized than
 people give it credit for but do you think the long reflection can actuallybe stable where we as human beings with
 our descendants of a brains would be able to sort of rationally discussthings together and arrive at ideas I


Speaker 0 :think overall we're pretty good at
 discussing things rationally and you know at least in the earlier stages ofour mind be other lives being open to
 many different ideas and being able to be convinced and change our views Ithink that Twitter's designed almost to
 bring out all the worst tendencies so if the long reflection were conducted onTwitter you know maybe would be better
 just not even not even to bother but I think the challenge really is getting toa stage where we have a society that
 is as conducive as possible to rational reflection to deliberation I think we'reactually very lucky to be in a liberal
 society where people are able to discuss a lot of ideas and so on I think when welook to the future that's not at all
 guaranteed that society would be like that rather than less I rather than asociety where there's a fixed Canon of
 values that are being imposed on all society and where you aren't able toquestion that that would be very bad for
 my perspective because it means we wouldn't be able to figure out what the

Speaker 1 :truth is I can already sense we're gonna
 go down yeah a million tangents but what do you think is the if Twitter is notoptimal what kind of mechanism this
 modern age of technology can we design where the exchange of ideas could beboth civilized and productive and yet
 not to be not be too constrained where there's rules of what you can say andcan't say which is as you say is not
 desirable but yet not have some limits as what can be said or not and so on doyou have any ideas thoughts on a
 possible future of course nobody knows how to do it but do you have thoughts ofwhat a better Twitter might look like I


Speaker 0 :think that text-based media are
 intrinsically going to be very hard to be conducive to professional discussionbecause if you think about it from a non
 informational perspective if I just send you a text of less than what is it nowtwo hundred and forty characters doing
 than 80 characters I think that's a tiny amount of information compared to sayyou and I talking now
 where you have access to the words I say which is the same as in text but also mytone also my body language and we're
 very poorly designed to be able to assess you know I have to read all thiscontext into anything you say so
 you know I say you may be your partner sends you a text and as a full-stop atthe end are they mad at you right you
 don't know you have to infer everything about this person's mental state fromwhether they put a full staff at the end
 of a text or know where the flip side of

Speaker 1 :that
 is it truly text that's the problem here because there's a there's a viral aspectto the text where it's you could just
 post text non-stop it's very immediate you know in the times before Twitterbefore the internet you know the way you
 would exchange texts is you write books yeahand that while it doesn't get body
 language it doesn't get tone it doesn't so on but it does actually boil downafter some time thinking some editing so
 on boil down ideas so so yeah it's is the immediacy and the viral nature theout that which produces the outrage mobs
 and so on the potential problem I think

Speaker 0 :that is a big issue I think there's
 going to be the strong selection effect where something provokes outrage wellthat's high arousal you're more likely
 to to retweet that where there's kind of so bill analysis is not as sexy not asviral I do agree that long-form content
 is much better to productive discussion in terms of the media that very popularat the moment I think the podcasting is
 great where like your podcast for two hours long so they're much more thandepth than Twitter are and you are able
 to convey so much more nuance so much more caveat because it's an actualconversation it's more like the sort of
 communication that we've evolved to do rather than kind of these very smalllittle snippets of ideas that when also
 combined with bad incentives just clearly aren't designed for helping us

Speaker 1 :get to the truth it's kind of
 interesting there it's not just the length of the podcast medium but it'sthe fact that was started by people that
 don't give a damn about quote unquote the man yet of that it's there's arelaxed sort of the style like that Joe
 Rogan does there's a freedom took to to express ideas in a unconstrained waythat's very real it's kind of funny in
 that it feels so refreshing Lee real to us today and I wonder what thefuture looks like it's a little bit sad
 now that quite a lot of sort of more popular people are getting intopodcasting mm-hmm and then like me you
 know and like and they they tried to sort of create they try to control itthey try to constrain it in different
 kinds of ways people I love like Conan O'Brien and so on different comediansand I'd love to see where the the real
 aspects of this podcast and medium persists maybe in TV maybe in YouTubemaybe Netflix is pushing those kind of
 ideas and it's kind of it's a really exciting word that kind of sharing of

Speaker 0 :knowledge yeah I mean I think it's a
 double-edged sword as it becomes more popular and more profitable where on theone hand you'll get a lot more
 creativity people doing more interesting things with the medium but also perhapsyou get this place to the bottom where
 suddenly maybe pod will be hard to find good content on podcasts because it'llbe so overwhelmed by you know the latest
 bit of viral outrage so speaking of that

Speaker 1 :jumping on effective attrition for a
 second so so much of that internet content is funded by advertisements justin your in the context of effective
 altruism we're talking about Inc the the the richest companies in the worldthey're funded by advertisements
 essentially Google that's their primary source William do you see that as do youhave any criticism of that source of
 income do you see that source of money as a potentially powerful source ofmoney that could be used well certainly
 can be used for good but is there something bad about that source of money

Speaker 0 :I think the significant worries with it
 where it means that the incentives of the company might be quite misalignedwith you know making people's lives
 better where again perhaps the incentives aretowards increasing drama and debate on
 your social news social media feed in order the morepeople are going to be engaged perhaps
 kind of compulsively involved with the platform whereas there are otherbusiness models like having an opt-in
 subscription service where perhaps they have other issues but there's much moreof a incentive to provide a product that
 its users are just like really wanting because you know now I'm paying for thisproduct I'm paying for this thing I want
 to buy rather than I'm trying to use this thing and it's gonna get a profitmechanism that is somewhat orthogonal to
 me actually just wanting to use the use the product and so I mean in some casesit will work better than others I can
 imagine a I can in theory you imagine Facebook movie having a subscriptionservice but I think it's you know
 unlikely to happen anytime soon

Speaker 1 :well it's interesting and it's weird now
 that you bring it up that it's unlikely this example I pay I think 10 bucks amonth for YouTube's bread mm-hmm and
 that's another thing I get it much for that except just so no ads yeah but ingeneral it's just a slightly better
 experience and I would gladly now I'm not wealthy in fact I'moperating very close to zero dollars but
 I would pay 10 bucks a month to Facebook content mok's a month to Twitter yeahfor some kind of more control yeah in
 terms of advertisements and so on but the other aspect of that is datayeah personal data people are really
 sensitive about this and I'm I as one who hopes to one day create a companythat may may use people's data to do
 good for the world wonder about this for one the psychology of why people are soparanoid well I understand why but they
 seem to be more paranoid than it's justified at times and the other is howdo they do it right so it seems that
 Facebook is it seems that Facebook is doing it wrongthat's certainly the part of the popular
 narrative it's unclear to me actually how wronglike I tend to give him more benefit of
 the doubt because there you know it's a really hard thing to do right mmm andpeople don't listen realize it but how
 do we respect in your view people's

Speaker 0 :privacy yeah I mean in the case of how
 worried are people about using the data I mean there's a lot of public debateand criticism about it when we look at
 people's revealed preferences yeah you know people's continuing massive use ofthese sorts of services it's not clear
 to me how much people really do care perhaps they care a bit but they'rehappy to in effect kind of sell their
 data in order to be able to get you a

Speaker 1 :certain service that's a great term
 reveal preferences so these aren't preferences your self-report in a surveythis is like your actions speak yeah


Speaker 0 :exactly so you might say oh yeah I hate
 the idea of Facebook having my data but then when it comes to it you actuallyare willing to give that data in
 exchange for being able to use the service and if that's the case then Ithink unless we have some explanation
 about why why there's some negative externality from that or why there'ssome coordination failure
 or if there's something that consumers are just really misled about where theydon't realize why giving away data like
 this is a really bad thing to do then ultimately I kind of want to you knowrespect people's preferences they can
 give away their data if they want I think there's a big difference betweencompanies use of data and governments
 having data where you know looking at the particular code of history atgovernments knowing a lot about their
 people can be very bad if the government chooses to do bad things with it andthat's more wedding I think so let's


Speaker 1 :jump into it a little bit most people
 know but actually I two years ago I had no idea what effective altruism wasuntil I saw there's a cool-looking event
 in an MIT group here mm-hmm they I think the it's called theeffective altruism Club or a group
 that's like what the heck is that yeah and one of my friends said I meanthey he said that they're just eccentric
 characters I was like hell yes I'm in so I went to one of their events and lookedup what's it about it's quite a
 fascinating philosophical and just a movement of ideas so can you tell mewhat is effective altruism great so the


Speaker 0 :core of effective altruism is about to
 answer this question which is how can I do as much good as possible with myscarce resources my time and with my
 money and then once we have our best guess answers to that trying to takethose ideas and put that into practice
 and do those things that we believe will do the most good and we're now acommunity of people many thousands of us
 around the world who really are Tanna answer that question as best we can andthen use our time and money to make the
 world better so what's the difference

Speaker 1 :between sort of classical general idea
 of altruism and effective altruism so

Speaker 0 :normally when people will try to do good
 they often often just aren't so reflective aboutthose attempts so someone might approach
 you in the street asking you to give to charity and you'll you know if you'refeeling out a stick you'll give to the
 person on the street or if you think oh I want to do some good in my life youmight volunteer at a local place or
 perhaps you'll decide you know pursue a career where you're working in a fieldthat's kind of more obviously beneficial
 like being a doctor or a nurse or health care professional but it's very rarethat people apply the same level of
 rigor and analytical thinking to lots of other areas we think about so take thecase of someone approaching you in the
 street imagine if that person instead was saying hey I've got this amazingcompany do you want to invest in it it
 would be insane and no one would ever think oh of course I'm just a companylike you'd think it was a scam
 but somehow we don't have that same level of rigor when it comes to doinggood even though the stakes are more
 important when it comes to trying to help others then kind of make money for

Speaker 1 :ourselves well first of all so there is
 a psychology at the individual level of doing good just feels good yes and so insome sense and that's pure psychological
 part it doesn't matter in fact you don't want to know if it does good or notbecause most of the time it won't yeah


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :so like in a certain sense it's
 understandable why altruism without the effective part is so appealing to acertain population by the way let's zoom
 off for a second do you think most people to questions do you think mostpeople are good and question number two
 is do you think most people want to do

Speaker 0 :good so are most people good I think
 it's just super dependent on the circumstances that someone is in I thinkthat the actions people take and their
 moral worth is just much more dependent on circumstance than it is on someone'sintrinsic character so there's an evil


Speaker 1 :within
 it seems like like with the better angels of our naturethere's a tendency of us as a society to
 tend towards good less war I mean with all these metrics hmm what is that usbecoming who we want to be or is that
 some kind of societal force what's the nature versus nurture thing here yes so

Speaker 0 :in that case I just think yeah so
 violence has massively declined over time I think that's a slow process ofcultural evolution institutional
 evolution such that now the incentives for you and I to be violent a very verysmall indeed in contrast when we were
 hunter-gatherers the incentives were quite large if there was someone who wasyou know potentially disturbing the
 social order and hunter-gatherer setting there was a very strong incentive tokill that person and people did and it
 was just the guarded you know 10% of deaths among hunter-gatherers allarguably were murders after a hunter


Speaker 1 :gatherers when you have actual societies
 is when bars can probably go up because there's more incentive to do massviolence right to take over all their
 conquer other people's lands and murder everybody in place and so on yeah I mean

Speaker 0 :I think total death leaf the mother heap
 from human causes does go down but you're right that if you're in ahunter-gatherer situation you're you
 kind of group that you're part of is very small then you know you can't havemassive wars that just massive
 communities does exist but anyway there

Speaker 1 :the second question eating most people
 want to do good yeah and then I think

Speaker 0 :that is true for most people I think you
 see that with the fact that you know most people donate a large proportion ofpeople volunteer if you give people
 opportunities to easily help other people they will take it but at the sametime we're a product of our
 circumstances and if it were more socially rewarded to be doing more goodif it were more socially the water to do
 good effectively about them not effectively then we would see thatbehavior a lot more why


Speaker 1 :why should we do good yeah my answer to


Speaker 0 :this is there's no kind of deeper level
 of explanation so my answer to kind of why should you good is well there issomeone whose life is on the line for
 example whose life you can save via donating just actually a few thousanddollars to an effective nonprofit and
 like the against malaria foundation that is a sufficient reason to do good andthen if you ask well why or I do that
 and like I just show you the same facts again those it's that fact that is thereason to do good there's nothing more
 fundamental than that

Speaker 1 :I'd like to sort of make more concrete
 the thing we're trying to make better so you just mentioned malaria so there's ahuge amount of suffering in the world
 are we trying to remove so is ultimately the goal not ultimately but the firststep is to remove the worst of the
 suffering so there's some kind of threshold of suffering they want to makesure it does not exist in the world or


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :do we really naturally want to take a
 much further step and look at things like income inequality so not justgetting everybody above a certain
 threshold but making sure that there is some that that is broadly speakingthere's less injustice in the world
 unfairness in some definition of course very difficult to define a fairness yeah

Speaker 0 :so the metric I use is how many people
 do we affect and by how much do we affect them and so that can you knowoften that means eliminating suffering
 but it doesn't have to could be helping promote a flourishing life instead andso if I was comparing you know reducing
 income inequality or a limb you know getting people from the very pits ofsuffering to a higher level the app the
 question I would ask is just a quantitative one of just if I do thisfirst thing of a second thing how many
 people am I going to benefit and by how much am I going to benefit am I going tomove that one person from kind of 10% 0%
 well-being to 10% well-being perhaps that's just not as good as moving ahundred people from 10% well-being to
 50% well-being and the idea is the

Speaker 1 :diminishing returns is the idea of one
 year the when you're in terrible poverty then the one dollar that you give goesmuch further than if you were in the
 middle class in the United States for

Speaker 0 :example absolutely and this this fact is
 really striking so if you take even just quite a conservative estimateof how we are able to turn money into
 well-being The Economist put it as like a log curve that's the or steeper butthat means that any proportional
 increase in your income has the same impact on your well-being and so someonemoving from thousand dollars a year to
 two thousand dollars a year has the same impact to someone moving from a hundredthousand dollars a year to two hundred
 thousand dollars a year and then when you combine that with the fact that wein middle class members of rich
 countries are a hundred times richer than financial terms in the global poorthat means we can do a hundred times to
 benefit the poorest people in the world as we can to benefit people of ourincome level and that's this astonishing
 fact yeah it's it's quite incredible

Speaker 1 :a lot of these facts and ideas are just
 difficult to think about because there's

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :an overwhelming amount of suffering in
 the world and even acknowledging it is difficultnot exactly sure why that is I mean I


Speaker 0 :mean it's difficult because you have to
 bring to mind you know it's an unpleasant experience thinking aboutother people suffering it's unpleasant
 to be empathizing with it firstly and then secondly thinking about it meansthat maybe we'd have to change our
 lifestyles and if you're very attached to the income that you've got perhapsyou don't want to be confronting ideas
 or arguments that might cause you to use some of that money to help others soit's quite understandable in the
 psychological terms even if it's not the right thing that we ought to be doing so

Speaker 1 :how can we do better how can we be more
 effective how does data help yeah in general how can how can we do better

Speaker 0 :it's definitely hard and we have spent
 the last ten years engaged in kind of some deeper search projects so today ananswer
 can two questions one is of all the many problems the world is facing what arethe problems we ought to be focused on
 and then within those problems that we judge to become the most pressing wherewe use this idea of focusing on problems
 that are the biggest in scale there are the most fact able where we can do havethe kind of make the most progress on
 that problem and there are the most neglected within them what the thingsthat are have the kind of best evidence
 or we have the best guest will do the most good and so we have a bunch oforganizations so I give well for example
 is focused on global health and development and has a list of seven toprecommended charities so the idea in


Speaker 1 :general and sorry to interrupt is so
 what doc was sort of poverty and Emma will flare an existential risk this isall fascinating topics but in general
 the idea is there should be a group not sorry there's a lot of groups that seekto convert money into good and then you
 also on top of that want to have a accounting of how good they actually didperform that conversion how well they
 did in converting money to good so ranking of these different groupsranking this the charities so that does
 that apply across basically all aspects of effective altruism so there should bea group of people and they should be
 they should report on certain metrics on how well they've done and you shouldonly give your money to groups that do a


Speaker 0 :good job that's the core idea I'd make
 two comments one is just it's not just about moneyso we're also trying to encourage people
 to work in areas where they'll have the biggest impact absolutely and in someareas you know they're really people
 heavy but money poor other areas of the money which and people poor and sowhether it's better to focus time or
 money um depends on the cause area and then the second is that you mentionedmetrics and while that's the ideal and
 in some areas we do we are able to get somewhatquantitative information about how much
 impact an area is having that's not always true for some of the issues likeyou mentioned existential risks well
 we're not able to measure in any sort of precise way like how much progress we'remaking and so you have to instead fall
 back on just a regular sgt and evaluation even in the absence of data

Speaker 1 :so as let's first sort of linger on your
 own story for a second how do you yourself practice effective altruism inyour own life because I think that's
 really interesting place to start so

Speaker 0 :I've tried to build effective altruism
 into at least many components of my life so on the donation side my plan is togive away most of my income over the
 course of my life I've got a set bar I feel happy with and I just donate abovethat bar so at the moment I donate about
 twenty percent of my income then on the career side I've also shifted kind ofwhat I do where I was initially planning
 to work on very esoteric topics in the philosophy of logic for us whoselanguage things that have intellectually
 extremely interesting but the path by which they really make a difference tothe world is let's just say it's very
 unclear that at best and so I switched and said to researching ethics toactually just working on this question
 of how we can do as much good as possible and then I've also spent a verylarge chunk of my life over the last ten
 years creating a number of nonprofits who again in different ways are tacklingthis question of how we can do the most
 good and helping them to grow over time - yeah we'll mention a few of them of

Speaker 1 :the career selection 80,000 80,000 hours


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :80,000 hours and a really interesting
 group so maybe also just a quick pause on the origins of effective altruismbecause you paint a picture who the key
 figures are including yourself in the effect of ultras

Speaker 0 :movement today yeah there are two main
 strands that can I came together to form the effect of altruism movement so onewas two philosophers myself and Toby
 awed at Oxford and we had been very influenced by the work of Peter Singerand Australian moral philosopher who had
 argued for many decades that because one can do so much good at such little costto oneself we have an obligation to give
 away most of our income to benefit those and actually in poverty just in the sameway that we have an obligation to run in
 and save a child from Adamic finish planning in a shallow pond if it wouldjust tell you in your suit to the
 coaster a few thousand dollars and we set up given what we can in 2009 whichis encouraging people to give at least
 10 percent of our income to the most effective charities and the second mainstrand was the formation of giveWell
 which was originally based in New York and started in about 2007 and that wasset up by Holden canossian le Hassenfeld
 who were two hedge fund dudes who you know making making good money andthinking well where should I donate and
 in the same way as if they wanted to buy a product for themselves they would lookat Amazon reviews they were like well
 what are the best charities fans they just weren't really good answers to thatquestion
 certainly not they were satisfied with and so they formed giveWell in order totry and work out what are those
 charities where they can have the biggest impact and then from there andsome other influences can a community
 glue and spread can we explore the

Speaker 1 :philosophical and political space that
 effective altruism occupies a little bit so from the little and distant in my ownlife time that I've read of Iran's work
 Iran's philosophy of Objectivism espouses and it's interesting to put herphilosophy in contrast yeah with
 effective altruism so it espouses selfishness as the best thing you can doyeah and if you but it's not actually
 against altruism its if it's just you have that choice but you should beselfish in it right or not maybe you can
 disagree here but so it can be viewed as the complete opposite of effectivealtruism or it can be viewed as similar
 because the word effective is really interesting because if you want to dogood then you should be damn good at
 doing good right that's the I think that would fit within the the morality that'sdefined by objectivism so do you see a
 connection between these two philosophies and other perhaps other inthis in this complicated space of
 beliefs that effective altruism is positioned as opposing or

Speaker 0 :lined with oh definitely say that
 objectivism England's philosophy is a philosophy that's you know quitefundamentally opposed to effective
 altruism in we can waive insofar as England's philosophy is aboutchampioning egoism and saying that are
 never quite sure whether the philosophy is meant to say that just you ought todo whatever will best benefit yourself
 as ethical egoism no matter what the consequences are or second if there'sthis alternative view which is well you
 ought to attain benefit yourself because that's actually the best way ofbenefiting society certainly in you know
 Atlas Shrugged she is presenting her philosophy as a way that's you knowactually going to bring about a
 flourishing society and if it's the former then well effective altruism isall about promoting the idea of altruism
 so it's and saying in fact we ought really be trying to help others as muchas possible so it's opposed there and
 then on the second side I would just dispute the empirical premise it wouldseem given the major problems in the
 world today it would seem like this remarkable coincidence quite suspiciousone might say if benefiting myself was
 actually the best way to bring about a better world so in that point and I

Speaker 1 :think that connects also with career
 selection that we'll talk about but let's consider not objectives butcapitalism so and the idea that you
 focusing on the thing that you damn I are damn good at whatever that is yeahmaybe the best thing for the world sort
 of part of it is also mindset right sort of like I the thing I love is robots

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah so maybe I should focus on building
 robots and never even think about the idea of effective altruism it which iskind of the capitalist notion yeah is
 there any value in that idea and just finding anything you're good at andmaximizing your productivity in this
 world and thereby sort of lifting the ball boats and benefiting societyand as a result yeah I think there's two


Speaker 0 :things I'd want to say on that so one is
 what your comparative advantages what your strengths are when it comes tocareer there's obviously super important
 because you know there's lots of career paths I would be terrible at if I wasthought being an artist was the best
 thing one could do well I'd be doomed just really it quite astonishingly badand so I do think at least within the
 realm of things that could plausibly be very high impact yeschoose the thing that you're gonna that
 you think you're going to be able to like really be passionate at and excelat kind of over the long term then on
 this question of like should one just do that in an unrestricted way and not eventhink about what the most important
 problems are I do think that in a kind of perfectly designed society that mightwell be the case that would be a society
 where we've collected all market failures we've internalized allexternalities and then we've managed to
 set up incentives such that people just pursuing their own strengths is the bestway of doing good but we're very far
 from that Society so if one did that then you know it would be very unlikelythat you would focus on improving the
 lives of non-human animals that you know aren't participating in markets orensuring the long-run future goes well
 we're future people certainly aren't participating in markets our benefitingthe global poor who do participate but
 have so much less can a power from a starting perspective that their views onaccurately kind of represented in by


Speaker 1 :market forces to guarded so yeah the in
 serves pure pure definition capitalism and just seem may very well ignore thepeople that are suffering the most the
 wide swath of them so if you could allow me this line of thinking here so I'velistened to a lot of your conversations
 Yellin I find if I can compliment you is there very interesting conversation isyour conversation on Rogan and Joe
 Rogan's was really interesting with sam harris and so on whateverthere's a lot of stuff that's really
 good out there and yet when I look at the internet andlook at YouTube which has certain mobs
 certain swaths of right-leaning folks yeahwhom I dearly love I love all people
 all especially people with ideas they seem to not like you very much so Idon't understand why exactly so what my
 own sort of hypothesis is there is a right left divide that absurdly socaricatured in politics at least in the
 United States and maybe you're somehow pigeon-holed into one of those sides andthere did you know maybe that that's
 what it is this may be your message is somehow politicized yeah I mean well how

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :how do you make sense of that because
 you're extremely interesting like you got the the comments I see on Joe Roganthere's a bunch of negative stuff and
 yet if you listen to it the conversation is fascinating I'm not speaking I'm notsome kind of lefty yeah extremist but
 just this a fascinating conversation so why are you getting some wine like

Speaker 0 :nollamara hate so I'm actually pretty
 glad that effective altruism has managed to stay on relatively unpoliticalbecause I think the core message just
 use some of your time and money to do as much good as possible to fight some ofthe problems in the world can be you
 know appealing across the political spectrum and we do have a diversity ofpolitical viewpoints among people who
 have engaged and effective altruism we do however do get some criticism fromthe left and the light was to Chris both


Speaker 1 :Oh be interesting to hear yeah so


Speaker 0 :criticism from the left is that we're
 not focused enough on dismantling the capitalist system that they see as theloot of most of the problems that we're
 talking about and there I kind of disagree on partly the premisewhere I don't think relevant alternative
 systems would say to the animals or to the the global poor which the futuregenerations can a much better and then
 also the tactics where I think for the particular ways we can change societythat would massively benefit you know be
 massively beneficial on those things that don't go via dismantling like theentire system which is perhaps a million
 times harder to do then criticism on the right there's definitely in like inresponse to the Joe Rogan podcast they
 definitely were a number of inland fans who weren't keen on the idea ofpromoting altruism there was a
 remarkable set of ideas just the idea of it affected unmanly I think was driving

Speaker 1 :a lot of criticism let me okay so I love
 fighting I've been in street fights my whole lifeI'm uh I'm as alpha and everything I do
 as he gets and the fact that and Joe Rogan said that I thought scent of awoman is a better movie than John wick
 put me into this beta category among

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :people core like basically saying this
 yeah unmanly or it's not tough it's not it's not some yeah principled view ofstrength that is represented by as
 possible and so actually so how do you think about this because to me altruismespecially effective altruism is I don't
 I don't know what the female version of that is but on the male side manliest[ __ ] if I may say so so what how do you
 think about that kind of criticism I

Speaker 0 :think people who would make that
 criticism are just occupying a like state of mind that I think is just sodifferent from my state of mind that I
 kind of struggle to maybe even understand it where if something's manlyor unmanly or feminine or unfeminine I'm
 like I don't care like is it the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do soyeah I let me put in that in terms of


Speaker 1 :man a woman yeah I don't think that's
 useful but I think there's notion of acting out of fear yeah that

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :or as opposed to out of principle and


Speaker 0 :strength yeah so okay yeah here's
 something that I do you know feel as an intuition and that I think drives somepeople who do find kind of a and land
 attractive and and so on as a philosophy which is a kind of taking power ofyou're taking control of your own life
 and having power over how you're stealing your life and not kind ofcowering to others you know really
 thinking things through I find like that set of ideas just very compelling andinspirational but I actually think of
 effective altruism has really Xenu that side of my personality it's likescratch that itch where you and just not
 taking the kind of priorities that society is giving you is granted insteadyou're choosing to act in accordance
 with the priorities that you think are most important in the world and oftenthat involves then doing quite on quite
 unusual things from a societal perspective like donating a large chunkof your earnings or working on these
 weird issues about AI and so on that other people might not understand yeah I

Speaker 1 :think that's a really gutsy thing to do
 that is taking control that's at least at this stage I mean that that's that'syou taking ownership not of just
 yourself but your presence in this world that's full of suffering and saying asopposed to being paralyzed by that
 notion yeah it's taking control and saying I could do something yeah I meanthat's really powerful but I mean sort
 of the the one thing I personally hate too about the left currently that Ithink those folks to detect is the
 social signaling mmm-hmm do you see when you look at yourselfyeah sort of
 late at night would you do everything you're doing in terms of effectivealtruism if your name because you're
 quite popular but if your name was totally unattached to itif it was in secret yeah I mean I think


Speaker 0 :I would to be honest I think the kind of
 popularity is like you know it's mixed bag but there are serious costs and Idon't particularly I don't like love it
 like it means you get all these people calling you a [ __ ] on Joey Logan it'slike not the most fun thing like how do


Speaker 1 :you also get a lot of sort of brownie
 points for doing good for the world yeah

Speaker 0 :you do but I think I think my ideal life
 I would be like in some library solving logic puzzles all day and I'd likereally be like learning maths and so on
 so you're and how you know have a like good buddy offends and so on so your

Speaker 1 :instinct for effective altruism is
 something deep it's it's not it's not a it's not one that you know it'scommunicating socially it's more in your
 heart you want to do good for the world

Speaker 0 :yeah I mean so we can look back to early
 giving what we can so you know we're setting this up me and giving me andToby and I really thought that doing
 this would be a big hit to my academic career because I was now spending youknow at that time more than half my time
 setting up this nonprofit at the crucial time when you should be like producingtheir best academic work and so on
 and it was also the case that at the time it was kind of like the Toby OrderClub you know he was he was the most
 popular this personal interest story around him and his plans donate andsorry to interrupt but Toby was donating


Speaker 1 :a large amount can you tell just briefly
 what he was doing

Speaker 0 :yeah so he made this public commitment
 to give everything here and above 20,000 pounds per year to the most effectivecauses and even as a graduate student he
 was still donating about 15-20 percent of his income which so quite significantgiven that graduate students are not
 known for being super wealthy that's right and when we launched giving whatwe can the media just loved this as like
 a a personal into their story so the story about him and his pledge was themost yeah it was actually the most
 popular news story of the day and we kind of ran the same story a year laterand it was the most popular and used to
 a year later - and so it really was kind of several years before then I was alsokind of giving more talks I'm starting
 to do more writing and then especially with you know whether it was book doinggood better that then they started to be
 kind of attention and so on but deep

Speaker 1 :inside your own relationship with
 effective altruism was I mean it had nothing to do with the publicity thatdid it did you see yourself how did the
 publicity connect with it yeah I mean

Speaker 0 :that's kind of what I'm saying is I
 think the publicity came like several years after afterwards I mean at theearly stage when we set up giving what
 we can it was really just every person we get pledged 10% is you know somethinglike $100,000 over their lifetime that's
 huge so it was just we had started with 23 members every single person was justthis like kind of huge accomplishment
 and at the time I just really thought you know maybe over time we'll have ahundred members and they'll be like
 amazing whereas now we have you know over four thousand and one and a halfbillion dollars pledged that's just
 unimaginable to me at a time when I was first kind of getting this you know gangwith stuff off the ground so can we talk


Speaker 1 :about poverty and the other the biggest
 problems that you think in the near term effective altruism can can attack ineach one so poverty obviously is a huge


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :one yeah how can we help okay yeah so


Speaker 0 :poverty absolutely this huge problem
 seven hundred million people and actually in poverty living in less than$2 per day where that's what that means
 is what $2 would buy in the US so think about that it's like some rice maybesome beans it's very you know really not
 much and at the same time we can do an enormous amount to improve the lives ofpeople in extreme poverty so the things
 that we tend to focus on are interventions in global health andthat's for a couple few reasons one is
 that Global Health just has this amazing fact they're called lifeexpectancy globally is up 50% relative
 to 60 or 70 years ago we've ever allocated smallpox that's which killed 2million lives every year almost
 eradicated polio second is that we just have great data on what works when itcomes to global health so we just know
 that bed nets protects children from prevent them from dying from malaria andthen the third is just that's extremely
 cost effective so it costs $5 to buy one bed net protects two children for twoyears against malaria if you spend about
 $3,000 on bed nets then statistically speaking you're going to save a child'slife and there are other interventions
 too and so given people in such suffering and we have this opportunityto you know do such huge good for such
 low cost well yeah why not so the

Speaker 1 :individuals of for me today
 if I wanted to to look at poverty how would I help and I wanted to say I thinkdonating 10% of your income is a very
 interesting idea or some percentage or some setting a bar instead of stickingto it how do we then take the step
 towards the effective part so you've conveyed some notions but who do yougive the money to


Speaker 0 :yeah so give well this organization I
 mentioned is well it makes charity recommendations and some of its toprecommendations so against malaria
 foundation is this organization that buys and distributes these insecticidesthey did bed nets and then it has a
 total of seven like charities that it recommends very highly

Speaker 1 :so that recommendation is it is almost
 like a star of approval or is there some metrics so what are what are the waysthat give well conveys that this is a
 great charity organization yeah so give

Speaker 0 :well is looking at metrics and it's
 trying to compare Travie T is ultimately in the number of lives that you can saveor an equivalent benefit so one of the
 charities that recommends is give directly whichjust transfers cash to the poorest
 families where poor family will get a cash transfer $1,000 and they kind ofregard that's the baseline intervention
 because it's it's so simple and people you know they know what to do with howto benefit themselves that's quite


Speaker 1 :powerful by the way so before give war
 before the effect of autism movement was there I imagine as a huge amount ofcorruption mm-hmm
 funny enough in charity organizations or misuse of money yeah so that now therewas nothing like give up before that no


Speaker 0 :I mean there was some so I mean the
 charity corruption I mean obviously there's some I don't think it's a hugeissue if I were to just focusing him
 along things prior to give well there were some organizations like CharityNavigator which were more aimed at
 worrying about corruption and so on so they weren't saying these are thecharities where you're going to do the
 most good instead it was like how good are the charity's financials how good isthis held are they transparent and yeah
 so that would be more useful for weeding out some of those worst charities so

Speaker 1 :give well just taking a step further
 sort of in this 21st century yeah of data it's actually looking at theeffective part yeah so it's like you


Speaker 0 :know if you know the wire cutter if you
 want to buy a pair of headphones they will just look over headphones behindthese the best headphones you can buy
 that's the idea with gift well okay so

Speaker 1 :do you think there's a a bar of what
 suffering is and do you think one day we can eradicate suffering in our world

Speaker 0 :yeah amongst humans let's talk humans


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :for now talk point humans but in general
 yeah actually so there's a colleague of mine kind of turn abolitionism for theidea that we should just be kind of a
 bowl of suffering and in the long run I mean I don't expect anytime soon but Ithink we can I think that would require
 you know quite change quite drastic changes to the way society is structuredand perhaps even the you know that he in
 fact even changes to human nature but I do think that suffering whenever itoccurs
 that and we should want it to not cur so

Speaker 1 :there's a there's a line there's a gray
 area between suffering now I'm Russian so I romanticize some aspects ofsuffering there's a gray line between
 struggle gray area between struggle and suffering so one do we want to eradicateall struggle in the world there's a this
 there's an idea you know that the human conditioninherently has suffering in it and it's
 a creative force it's this it's a struggle of our lives and we somehowgrow from that how do you think about
 how do you think about that I agree

Speaker 0 :that's true so you know often you know
 clay artists can be also suffering from you know major health conditions or theplayer and still want to come from


Speaker 1 :abusive parents yeah most I'm great
 artists they think come from abusive parents yeah that seems to be he's

Speaker 0 :commonly the case but I want to
 distinguish between suffering as being instrumentally good you know it causespeople to produce good things and
 whether it's intrinsically good and I think in physically it's always bad andso if we can produce these you know
 great achievements via some other means where you know if we look at thescientific enterprise we've produced
 incredible things often from people who aren't suffering have you know the goodlives they're just they're driven
 instead of you know being pushed by sense or languish they're being drivenby intellectual curiosity if we can
 instead produce a society where it's all carrot and no stickthat's better from my perspective yeah


Speaker 1 :but unless disagree with the notion that
 that's possible but I would say most of the suffering inthe world is not productive so I would a
 dream of effective altruism curing that suffering yeah but then I would say thatthere is some suffering that is
 productive that we want to keep that because but that's not even the focus ofbecause most of the suffering is just
 absurd yet I mean used to be eliminated so let's not even romanticize this usualnotion I have but nevertheless struggle
 has some kind of an inherent value that to me at least you're right there's someelements of human nature that also have
 to be modified in order to cure all suffering yeah I mean there's an

Speaker 0 :interesting question of whether it's
 possible so at the moment you know most of the time we're kind of neutral andthen we burn ourselves and that's
 negative and that's really good that we get that negative signal because itmeans we won't burn ourselves again
 there's a question like could you design agents humans such that you're nothovering around the zero level you're
 having it like bliss yeah and then you touch the flame in your own oh you justslightly worse bliss yeah but that's
 really bad compared to the bliss you were normally in so that so you can havelike a gradient of bliss instead of like
 pain and pleasure well on that point I

Speaker 1 :think it's a really important point on
 the experience of suffering the relative nature of it maybe having grown up inthe Soviet Union were quite poor by any
 measure in and when I when I was my childhood but it we didn't feel like youwere poor because everybody around you
 were poor as uh and then in America I feel I for the first time begin to feelpoor yeah because of the road there's
 different there's some cultural aspects to it that really emphasize that it'sgood to be rich and then there's just
 the notion that there's a lot of income inequality and therefore you experiencethat inequality that's where it's often
 called do you so what do you think about the inequality of suffering that that wehave to think about do you that do you
 think we have to think about that as part of effective altruism yeah I think

Speaker 0 :we're just things vary in terms of
 whether you get benefits or cost from them just in relative terms or inabsolute terms so a lot of the time yeah
 there's this hedonic treadmill where if you getyou know there's money is useful because
 it helps you buy things or good for you because it helps you buy things butthere's also a status component too and
 that status component is kind of zero-sum if you were saying like inRussia you know no one else felt poor
 because everyone around you is poor whereas now you've got this these otherpeople who are you know super rich and
 maybe that makes you feel you know less good about yourself there are some otherthings however which are just in tins
 eclis good or bad so commuting for example is just people hate it itdoesn't really change knowing that other
 people are commuting to doesn't make it any any kind of less bad but to push

Speaker 1 :back on that for a second I mean yes but
 also if some people were you know on horseback your commute and the trainmight feel a lot better yeah you know
 the there is a relative nickname yeah everybody's complaining about societytoday forgetting it's forgetting how
 much better it is the better angels of our nature how the technology isimproved fundamentally improving most of
 the world's lives yes and actually

Speaker 0 :there's some psychological research on
 the well-being benefits of volunteering where people who volunteer tend to justfeel happier about their lives and one
 of the suggested explanations is it because it extends your reference classso no longer you comparing yourself to
 the Joneses who have they're slightly in that better car because realize that youknow people with much worse conditions
 than you and so now you know your life doesn't seem so bad that's actually an a

Speaker 1 :psychological level one of the
 fundamental benefits of effective altruism yeah is is I mean I guess it'sthe altruism part of effective altruism
 is exposing yourself to the suffering in the world allows you to be more yeahappier and actually allows you in the
 sort of meditative introspective way I realize that you don't need most ofwealth you have to to be happy


Speaker 0 :absolutely I mean I think effect that
 also has been this huge benefit for me and I really don't think that if I hadmore money that I was living on that
 that would change my level of well-being at allwell as engaging in something that I
 think is meaningful that I think is stealing humanity in a positivedirection that's extremely rewarding and
 so yeah I mean despite my best attempts at sacrificeum I don't know I think I've actually
 ended up happier as a result of engaging in effective altruism than it I wouldhave done that's such an interesting


Speaker 1 :idea yeah so let's let's talk about
 animal welfare sure easy question what is consciousness okay especially as ithas to do with the capacity to suffer I
 think there seems to be a connection between how conscious something is theamount of consciousness and its ability
 to suffer and that all comes into play of us us thinking how much sufferingthere's in the world with regard to
 animals so how do you think about animal welfare and consciousness okay well

Speaker 0 :consciousness easy question okay yeah I
 mean I think we don't have a good understanding of consciousness my bestguess is it's gone and by consciousness
 I'm meaning what it is feels like to be you a subjective experience this seemsto be different from everything else we
 know about in the world yeah I think it's Clio is very poorly understood atthe moment I think it has something to
 do with information processing so the fact that the brain is a computer orsomething like a computer so that would
 mean that very advanced AI could be conscious information processors ingeneral could be conscious with some
 suitable complexity but that also some

Speaker 1 :suitable complexity it's a question
 whether greater complexity creates some kind of greater consciousness whichrelates to animals yeah right is there
 if it's an information processing system and it's smaller and smaller is an antless conscious than a cow less conscious
 than an am monkey yeah and again this

Speaker 0 :super hard question but I think my best
 guess is yes like if you if I think more consciousness it's not some magicalthing that appears out of nowhere
 it's not you know Descartes thought it was just comes in from this other realmand then enters through the pineal gland
 in your vein and that's you kind of soul and it's conscious so it's got somethingto do with what's going on in your brain
 a chicken has one 300th of the size of the brain that you have aunts I don'tknow how small it is maybe it's a
 million for size my best guess which I may well be wrongabout cuz this is so hard is that in
 some relevant sense the chicken is experiencing consciousness to a lesserdegree than the human and the ant
 significantly less again I don't think it's as little as three hundredths asmuch I think there's evolutionary
 reasons for thinking that like the ability to feel pain comes on the sceneif I was heavily early on and we have
 lots of our brain that's dedicated stuff that doesn't seem to have to do andanything to do with consciousness
 language processing and so on so it seems like the easy so there's a lot of

Speaker 1 :complicated questions there that we
 can't ask the animals about but it seems that there's easy questions in terms ofsuffering which is things like factory
 farming that could be addressed yeah is that is that the lowest hanging fruit ifI may use crude terms here of animal
 welfare absolutely I think that's the

Speaker 0 :lowest hanging fruit so at the moment we
 kill we raise and kill about 50 billion animals every year so how many 50billion in yeah so for every human on
 the planet several times that number are being killed and the vast majority ofthem are raised in factory farms where
 basically whatever your view on animals I think you should agree even if youthink well maybe it's not bad to kill an
 animal maybe if the animal was lays in good conditions that's just not theempirical reality the empirical reality
 is that there kept an incredible cage confinement there dabiq tore detailedwithout anaesthetic you know chickens
 often peck each other to death other like otherwise because in such stressit's really you know I think when a
 chicken gets killed that's the best thing that happened to the chicken inthe course of its life and it's also
 completely necessary this is in order to save youknow a few pence for a place of meat or
 place of eggs and we have indeed found it's also just inconsistent withconsumer preference as well people who
 buy the products if they could they or they when you do surveys are extremelyagainst suffering in factory farms it's
 just they don't appreciate how bad it is and you know just tend to go with theeasy options and so then the best the
 most effective programs I know of at the moment are nonprofits that go tocompanies and work with companies to get
 them to take a pledge to cut certain sorts of animal products like eggs andcage confinement out of their supply
 chain and it's now the case that the top 50 food retailers and fast foodcompanies have all made these Kanna cage
 for the pledges and when you do the numbers you get the conclusion thatevery dollar you're giving to these
 nonprofits result in hundreds of chickens being spared from cage cageconfinement and then they're working to
 other other types of animals other products too so is that the most

Speaker 1 :effective way to do in have a ripple
 effect essentially it's supposed to directly having regulation hmm from ontop that says you can't do this so I


Speaker 0 :would be more open to the regulation
 approach but at least in the u.s. there's quite intense regulate to thecapture from the agricultural industry
 and so attempt that we've seen to try and change regulation have it's been areal uphill struggle there are some
 examples of ballot initiatives where the people have been able to vote in aballot to say we want to ban eggs from
 caged conditions and that's been huge that's been really good but beyond thatit's much more limited so I've been


Speaker 1 :really interested an idea of hunting in
 general wild animals and seeing nature as a form of Cruelty that I am ethicallymore okay with okay just from our


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :perspective and then I
 about wild animals suffering they I'm just I'm just giving you the kind ofyeah notion of how I felt because animal
 uh because animal factory farming is so bad yeah then living in the woods seemedgood yeah and yet when you actually
 start to think about it all I mean all of the animals in the animal world theliving in like terrible poverty right
 yeah yeah so you have all the medical conditions all of that I mean they'reliving horrible eyes it could be
 improved that's a really interesting notion that I think may not even beuseful to talk about because factory
 farming is such a big thing to focus on but it's nevertheless an interestingnotion to think of all the animals in
 the wild is suffering in the same way the humans in poverty are suffering yeah

Speaker 0 :I mean and often even worse so many
 animals we produced by our selection so you have a very large number of childrenin the expectation that only small
 number survive and so for those animals almost all of them just live short liveswhere they starve to death so yeah
 there's huge amounts of suffering in nature I don't think we should you knowpretend that it's this kind of wonderful
 paradise for most animals yeah their life is filled with hunger and fear anddisease I could agree with you entirely
 that when it comes to focusing on animal welfare we should focus on factoryfarming but we also yeah should be aware
 to the reality of what life for most animals is like so let's talk about a

Speaker 1 :topic I've talked a lot about and you've
 actually quite eloquently talked about which is the third priority thateffective altruism considers is really
 important is there's no existential risks yeah when you think about theexistential risks that are facing our
 civilization what's what's before us what concerns you what should we bethinking about from an especially from
 an effective altruism perspective okay

Speaker 0 :so the reason I started getting
 concerned about this was thinking about future generationswhere
 the key idea is just well feature people matter Marlee there are vast numbers offuture people if we don't cause of own
 extinction there's no reason why civilization might not last a millionyears I mean we last as long as typical
 mammalian species or a billion years is when the earth is no longer habitable orif we can take to the stars then perhaps
 it's trillions of years beyond that so the future could be very big indeed andit seems like we're potentially very
 early on in civilization then the second idea is just well maybe there are thingsthat are going to really derail that
 things that actually could prevent us from having this long wonderfulcivilization and instead could cause
 although an acausal own extinction or otherwise perhaps like lock ourselvesinto a very bad state and what ways
 could that happen well causing our own extinctiondevelopment of nuclear weapons in the
 20th century at least put on the table that we now had weapons that werepowerful enough that you could vary
 significantly despite society perhaps and all that nuclear war would kill itcause a nuclear winter perhaps that
 would be enough for the human race to go extinct when you think we haven't done

Speaker 1 :it sorry general why do you think we
 haven't done it yet this is surprising to you that having ayou know always for the past few decades
 several thousand of active ready to launch nuclear weapons warheads and yetwe have not launched them yeah ever
 since the initial launch on Hiroshima

Speaker 0 :and Nagasaki I think it's a mix of luck
 so I think it's definitely not inevitable that we haven't used them soJohn F Kennedy Jim Cuban Missile Crisis
 put the estimate of nuclear exchange between the US and USSR that's somewherebetween one and three and even so you
 know we really did come close at the same time I do think mutually assureddestruction is a reason why people don't
 go to war it would be mad um you know why nuclear powersdon't go to war do you think that holds
 if you can link around there for a

Speaker 1 :second like my dad's a physicist amongst
 other things and he believes that nuclear weapons are actually just reallyhard to build mm-hmm which is one of the
 really big benefits of them currently so that you don't have it's very hard ifyou're crazy to build to acquire a
 nuclear weapon so the mutually assured destructionreally works when you talk it seems to
 work better when it's nation states when it's serious people even if they're alittle bit you know dictatorial and so
 on do you think this mutual assured destruction idea will Caray how far willit carry us in terms of different kinds
 of weapons oh yeah I think it's your

Speaker 0 :point that nuclear weapons are very hard
 to build and relatively easy to control because you can control fissile materialis a really important one and future
 technology that's equally destructive might not have those properties so forexample if in the future people are able
 to design viruses perhaps using a DNA printing kit that's on that you know onecan just buy in fact there were
 companies in the process of creating home DNA printing kits well then perhapsthat's just totally democratized perhaps
 the power to reap huge destructive potential is in the hands of most peoplein the world or certainly most people
 with effort and then yeah I no longer trust mutually assured destructionbecause some for some people the idea
 that they would die is just not a disincentive there was a Japanese cultfor example Shinrikyo in the 90s that
 had they what they believed was the Armageddon was coming if you died beforeArmageddon you would get good karma you
 wouldn't go to hell if you died during Armageddon maybe you would go to helland they had a bio
 weapons program chemical weapons broke them when they were finally apprehendedthey hadn't stocks of sarin gas that
 were sufficient to kill four million people engaged in multiple terroristacts if they had had the ability to
 print a virus at home that would have been very scary so it's not impossible

Speaker 1 :to imagine groups of people that hold
 that kind of belief of a death as in suicide as a is a good thing for passageinto the next world and so on and then
 you connect them with some weapons then ideology and weaponry is make recreateserious problems for us we ask a quick
 question on what do you think is the line between killing most humans andkilling all humans how hard is it to
 kill everybody yeah I'm thought about this he I'vethought about it a bit I think is very


Speaker 0 :hard to kill everybody so in the case of
 let's say and all that nuclear exchange and let's say that leads to nuclearwinter we don't really know but we you
 know might well happen that would I think there's all inbillions of deaths would it kill
 everybody it's quite it's quite hard to see how that how it would kill everybodya few reasons one is just there were so
 many people yes you know seven and a half billion people so this bad eventhas to kill all you know all almost all
 of them secondly live in such a diversity of locations so in nuclearexchange of a virus that has to kill
 people who live in the coast of New Zealand which is going to beclimatically much more stable than other
 areas in the world or people who are on submarines or who have access to bunkersso this is very like there's just like


Speaker 1 :I'm sure there's like two guys and
 Siberia just badass there's the just human nature somehow yes perseveranceyeah and then the second thing is just


Speaker 0 :if there's some catastrophic event
 people really don't want to die so there's gonna be like you know hugeamounts of effort to ensure that it
 doesn't affect everyone

Speaker 1 :if you thought about what it it takes to
 rebuild a society or smaller smaller numbers like how big of a setback ohthese kinds of things are yeah so then


Speaker 0 :that's something where there's real
 uncertainty I think where at some point you just lose genetic sufficient geneticdiversity such that you can't come back
 there's a it's unclear how small that population is but if you've only got saya thousand people a few of the thousands
 and maybe that small enough what about

Speaker 1 :human knowledge and then there's human
 knowledge

Speaker 0 :I mean it's striking how short on
 geological timescales or evolutionary timescales the progress in or howquickly the progress in human knowledge
 has been like agriculture we only have entered in 10,000 BC cities will onlyhave you know 3,000 BC whereas typical
 mammal species is half a million years to a million years do you think it's

Speaker 1 :inevitable in some sense the agriculture
 everything that came the Industrial Revolution cars planes the internet thatlevel of innovation you think is


Speaker 0 :inevitable I think given how quickly it
 arose so in the case of agriculture I think that was dependent on climate soit was the kind of glacial period was
 over the earth warmed up a bit that made it much more likely that humans woulddevelop agriculture when it comes to the
 Industrial Revolution it's just you know again only took a few thousand yearsfrom cities to Industrial Revolution if
 we think ok we've gone back to this even let's say agricultural era but there'sno reason why we wouldn't go extinct in
 the coming tens of thousands of years or hundreds of thousands of years it seemsjust vet it would be very surprising if
 we didn't rebound unless there's some special reason that makes thingsdifferent yes so perhaps we just have a
 much greater like disease burden now so HIV exists it didn't exist before andperhaps that's kind of latent in
 being suppressed by modern medicine and sanitation and so on but would be a muchbigger problem for some you know utterly
 destroyed the society that was trying to rebound all this just maybe there'ssomething we don't know about


Speaker 1 :so another existential risk comes from
 the mysterious the beautiful artificial intelligence yeah so what what's theshape of your concerns about AI I think


Speaker 0 :that quite a lot of concerns about AI
 and sometimes the different risks don't get distinguished enough so the kind ofclassic worry most is closely associated
 with Nick Bostrom and eliezer yudkowsky is that we at some point move fromhaving now a way our systems to
 artificial general intelligence you get this very fast feedback effect where aGI is able to build health you know
 artificial intelligence helps you to build greater artificial intelligence wehave this one system that's suddenly
 very powerful far more powerful than others then perhaps far more powerfulthan you know the rest of the world
 combined and then secondly it has goals that are misaligned with human goals andso it pursues its own goals it realize
 hey there's this competition namely from humans it would better if we eliminatedthem in just the same way as Homo
 sapiens eradicated the Neanderthals in fact it in fact killed off most largeanimals on the planet let walk the
 planet so that's kind of one set of worries I think that's not my I thinkthese shouldn't be dismissed to science
 fiction I think it's something we should be taking very seriously but it's notthe thing you visualize when you're


Speaker 1 :concerned about them what the biggest
 near-term yeah I think yes I think it's

Speaker 0 :like one possible scenario that would be
 astronomically bad I think that other scenarios that would also be extremelybad compatibly bad lot more likely to
 occur so one is just we are able to they I so we're able to get it to dowhat we want it to do um and perhaps
 does not like this fast takeoff of AI capabilities within a single system it'sjust limited across many systems that do
 some different things but you do get very rapid economic and technologicalprogress as a result that concentrates
 power into the hands of a very small number of individuals perhaps a singledictator and secondly that single
 individual is a small group of individuals or single country is thenable to like lock in their values
 indefinitely via transmitting those values to artificial systems that haveno reason to die like you know their
 code is copyable perhaps you know Donald Trump or jumping create their kind of AIprogeny in an image and once you have a
 system that's content once you have a society that's controlled by AI you nolonger have one of the main drivers of
 change historically which is the fact that human life spans you know only ahundred years give or take that's really


Speaker 1 :interesting so as opposed to sort of
 killing off all humans is locking in and like creating a hell on earth basicallya set of sense that set of principles
 under which the society operates that's extremely undesirable so everybody issuffering indefinitely oh it doesn't I


Speaker 0 :mean it also doesn't need to be hell on
 earth it could just be the wrong values so we talked at the very beginning abouthow I want to see this kind of diversity
 of different values and exploration so that we can just work out what is kindof morally like what is good what is bad
 and then pursue the thing that's bad so actually so the idea of wrong values is

Speaker 1 :actually probably so the beautiful thing
 is there's no such thing as right and wrong values because we don't know theright answer we just kind of have a
 sense of which value is more right which is more wrong so any kind of lock-inmakes a value wrong because it prevents
 exploration of this kind yeah

Speaker 0 :and just you know imagine if fascist Val
 you know imagine if there was Hitler's utopia or Stalin's utopia or Donaldthumps or using pings forever yeah you
 know how how good or bad would that be compared to the best possible future wecould create and my suggestion is it
 really suck compared to the best possible future when you're just one

Speaker 1 :individual there are some individuals
 for home Donald Trump is perhaps the best possible future and so that's thewhole point of us individuals exploring
 the space together exactly yeah and which trying to figure out which is thepath that will make America great again
 yeah exactly so how can effective altruism help I mean this is a reallyinteresting notion they actually
 describing of artificial intelligence being used as extremely powerfultechnology in the hands of very few
 potentially one person yeah to create some very undesirable effect as opposedto AI and again the source of the
 undesirable dust there is the human you know AI is just a really powerful toolso whether it's that or where their AI
 is a GI just runs away from us completely how as individuals as aspeople and the effective altruism
 movement how can we think about something like this understand povertyand their welfare but this is a far-out
 incredibly mysterious and difficult problem okay well I think there's three

Speaker 0 :paths as an individual so if you're
 thinking about you know career paths you can pursue so one is going down the lineof technical AI safety so this is most
 relevant to the kind of AI winning AI taking over scenarios where this is justtechnical work on current machine
 learning systems often sometimes going more theoretical to on how we can ensurethat an AI is able to learn human values
 and able to act in the way that you want it to act and that's a pretty mainstreamissue and approach in machine learning
 today so you know we definitely need more people doing thatsecond is on the policy side of things
 which i think is even more important at the moment which is how shoulddevelopments in AI be managed on a
 political level how can you ensure that the benefits of AI are very distributedit's not being powered isn't being
 concentrated in the hands of a small set of individuals how do you ensure that onarms races between different AI
 companies that might result in them you know cutting corners with respect tosafety and so there the input as


Speaker 1 :individuals who can have is this we're
 not talking about money we're talking about effort we're talking about careerchoice here we're talking about career


Speaker 0 :choice yeah but then is the case that
 supposing you know you're like I've already decided my career I'm doingsomething quite different you can
 contribute with money to where at the center of effective altruism we set upthe long term future fund so if you go
 on to effective altruism dog you can donate we're a group of individuals willthen work out what's the highest value
 place they can donate to work on accidental risk issues with a particularfocus on AI and what's bad number three


Speaker 1 :this would path number three this was


Speaker 0 :that donated donations were the third
 option I was thinking of okay and then yeah there are you can also donatedirectly to organizations working on
 this like center for human compatible AI at Berkeley future of humanity Instituteat Oxford or other organizations to does
 AI keep you up at night this kind of

Speaker 1 :concern yeah it's kind of a mix where I


Speaker 0 :think it's very likely things are gonna
 go well I think we're gonna be able to solve these problemsI think that's by far the most likely
 outcome at least overnight far the most likely so if you look at all the

Speaker 1 :trajectories running away from our
 current moment in the next hundred years hmm you see AI creating destructiveconsequences as a small subset of those
 possible futures well at least yeah it kind of eternal the Selective

Speaker 0 :consequence
 I think that being a small subset at the same time it still freaks me out I meanwhen we're talking about the entire
 future of civilization then small probabilities you know 1% probabilitythat's terrifying what do you think


Speaker 1 :about Elon Musk's strong worry that we
 should be really concerned about existential risk so they I yeah I mean I

Speaker 0 :think you know broadly speaking I think
 he's right I think if we took if we talked we would probably have verydifferent probabilities on how likely it
 is that we're doomed but again when it comes to talking about the entire futureof civilization it doesn't really matter
 if it's 1% or if it's 50% we ought to be taking every possible safeguard we canto ensure that things go well loved and
 poorly last question if you yourself

Speaker 1 :could radical one problem from the world
 or would that problem be that's a great

Speaker 0 :question I don't know if I'm cheating in
 saying this but I think the thing I would most want to change is just thefact that people don't actually care
 about insuring the long-run future go as well people don't really care aboutfuture generations they don't think
 about it it's not part of their aims well in some sense you're not cheating

Speaker 1 :at all because in speaking the way you
 do in writing the things you're writing you're doing you're addressing exactlythis aspect exactly that that is your
 input into the into the effective altruism movement so for that well thankyou so much so now I'm gonna talk to you
 that really enjoyed it thanks so much for having me

Speaker 0 :thanks for listening to this

 from William McCaskill one additional unit of income can do a hundred times asmuch to benefit the extreme poor as it
 can to benefit you or I earning the typical us wage of twenty eight thousanddollars a year
 it's not often that you have two options one of which is a hundred times betterthan the other imagine a happy hour
 where you can either buy yourself a beer for five dollars or by someone else abeer for five cents if that were the
 case would probably be pretty generous next rounds on mebut that's effectively the situation
 were in all the time it's like a ninety nine percent off sale or buy one getninety-nine free it might be the most
 amazing deal you'll see in your life

Speaker 0 :thank you for listening and hope to see
