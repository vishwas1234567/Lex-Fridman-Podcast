Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 george hotz a.k.a geohot his second time on the podcasthe's the founder of comma ai an
 autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle technology companythat seeks to be to tesla autopilot what
 android is to the ios they sell thecomma two device for one thousand
 dollars that when installed in many of their supported cars can keepthe vehicle centered in the lane
 even when there are no lane markings it includesdriver sensing that ensures that the
 driver's eyes are on the road as you may know i'm a big fan of driversensing i do believe tesla autopilot and
 others should definitely include it in theirsensor suite also
 i'm a fan of android and a big fan of george for many reasonsincluding his non-linear out of the box
 brilliance and the fact that he's a superstarprogrammer
 of a very different style than myself styles makefights and styles make conversations so
 i really enjoyed this chat i'm sure we'lltalk many more times on this podcast
 quick mention of each sponsor followed by some thoughts related to the episodefirst is four sigmatic the maker of
 delicious mushroom coffee second is the codingdigital
 a podcast on tech and entrepreneurship that i listen toand enjoy and finally expressvpn
 the vpn i've used for many years to protect my privacy on the internetplease check out the sponsors in the
 description to get a discount and to support this podcast as a sidenote
 let me say that my work at mit on autonomous and semiautonomous vehiclesled me to study the human side of
 autonomy enough to understand that it's a beautifullycomplicated and interesting problem
 space much richer than what can be studied inthe lab
 in that sense the data that comma ai tesla autopilotand perhaps others like cadillac super
 crews are collecting gives us a chance to understand how wecan design safe
 semiautonomous vehicles for real human beingsin real world conditions i think this
 requires bold innovation and a serious exploration of the firstprinciples of the driving task

 and now here's my conversation with georgehotz so last time we started talking
 about the simulation this time let me ask you do you thinkthere's intelligent life out there in


Speaker 1 :the universe
 i've always maintained my answer to the fermi paradox i think therehas been intelligent life elsewhere in


Speaker 0 :the universe
 so the intelligent civilizations existed but they've blown themselves up so yourgeneral intuition is that intelligent
 civilizations quickly like there's that parameterin in the drake equation your senses
 they don't last very long yeah how are we doing on that like havewe lasted pretty


Speaker 1 :pretty good i don't know we do oh yeah
 i mean not quite yet well what telly has your caskey the iqrequired to destroy the world falls by
 one point every year

Speaker 0 :okay so technology democratizes
 the destruction of the world when can a

Speaker 1 :meme destroy the world


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :it kind of is already right somewhat
 i don't think i don't think we've seen anywhere near the worst of it yetworld's going to get weird well maybe a


Speaker 0 :mu can save the world
 you thought about that the meme lord elon musk fighting on the side of goodversus the uh the meme lord of the
 darkness which is uh not saying anything bad about donald trumpbut he is the the lord of the meme on
 the dark side he's a darth vader of memes

Speaker 1 :i think in every fairy tale
 they always end it with and they lived happily ever after and i'm like pleasetell me more about this happily ever
 after i've heard 50 percent of marriages end in divorceuh why doesn't your marriage end up
 there you can't just say happily ever after soit's the thing about destruction is it's
 over after the destruction um we have to do everything right inorder to avoid it
 and uh one thing wrong i mean actually that's what i really like aboutcryptography
 cryptography it seems like we live in a world where the defense winsum versus like nuclear weapons the
 opposite is true it is much easier to build a warheadthat splits into 100 little warheads
 than to build something that can you know take out 100 little warheads uhthe offense has the advantage there
 um so maybe our future is in crypto but

Speaker 0 :uh so cryptography right the goliath is
 the the defense and then all the differenthackers
 are the uh are the davids and that equation is flipped for nuclear warbecause there's so many like one nuclear
 weapon destroys everything

Speaker 1 :essentially yeah and it is much easier
 to uh attack with a nuclear weapon than it isto like the technology required to
 intercept and destroy a rocket is much more complicated thanthe technology required to just you know
 orbital trajectory send a rocket to

Speaker 0 :somebody
 so okay your intuition that the there were intelligentcivilizations out there but it's very
 possible that they're no longer there that's kind of a sad

Speaker 1 :picture they
 enter some steady state they all wirehead themselveswhat's wirehead um stimulate stimulate
 their pleasure centers uh and just you know live forever inthis kind of stasis
 they become well i mean i think the reason i believe this is because whereare they
 if there's some reason they stopped expandingbecause otherwise they would have taken
 over the universe the universe isn't that big or at least you knowlet's just talk about the galaxy right
 70 000 light years across uh i took that number from star trekvoyager i don't know how true it is but
 um uh yeah that's not big right 70

Speaker 0 :000 light years is nothing for some
 possible technology that you can imagine that could leverage like wormholes orsomething like that


Speaker 1 :you don't even need wormholes just a von
 neumann probe is enough a von neumann probe and a million years ofsublight travel and you'd have taken
 over the whole universe that clearly uh didn't happen sosomething stopped it


Speaker 0 :so you mean if you right for for like a
 few million years if you sent out probes that travel closewhat's sublight
 meaning close to the speed of light let's it just spreadsinteresting actually that's an
 interesting calculation huh so what makes you think that wouldbe able to uh communicate with them
 like uh yeah what what's why do you think we would able to beable to comprehend
 intelligent lives that are out there likeeven if they were among us kind of thing
 like or even just flying around well

Speaker 1 :i mean that's possible it's possible
 that there is some sort of prime directiveuh that'd be a really cool universe to
 live in um and there's some reason they're not making themselves visible tous
 but it makes sense that they would use the samewell at least the same entropy well


Speaker 0 :you're implying the same laws of physics
 i don't know what you mean by entropy

Speaker 1 :in this case oh yeah i mean if entropy
 is the scarce resource in the universe

Speaker 0 :so what do you think about like stephen
 wolfram and everything is a computation and then what if they are travelingthrough this world of computation so
 if you think of the universe as just information processingthen uh what you're referring to with
 with entropy and then these these pockets ofinteresting complex computations
 swimming around how do we know they're not already herehow do we know that this like all the
 different amazing things that are full of mysteryon earth
 are just like little footprints of intelligence from

Speaker 1 :light years away maybe i mean
 i tend to think that as civilizations expand they use more and more energyuh and you can never overcome the
 problem of waste heat so where is their

Speaker 0 :waste heat
 so we'd be able to with our crude methods be able to see like there's awhole lot of
 energy here but it could be something we're not i mean we don't understanddark energy right dark matter
 it could be just stuff we don't understand at all or they could have afundamentally different physics
 you know like that that we just don't

Speaker 1 :even compromise well i think
 okay i mean it depends how far out you want to go i don't think physics is verydifferent on the other side of the
 galaxy i would suspect that they have i mean ifthey're in our
 universe they have the same physics well

Speaker 0 :yeah that's the assumption we have
 but there could be like super trippy things likelike our cognition
 only gets to a slice oh and all the possible instruments that we can designonly get to a particular slice of the
 universe and there's something much

Speaker 1 :like weirder maybe we can try a thought
 experiment um would people from the pastbe able to detect the remnants of our
 uh we would be able to detect our modern civilization i think the answer isobviously yes


Speaker 0 :you mean past from 100 years ago well


Speaker 1 :let's even go back further let's go to a
 million years ago right the humans who were lying aroundin the desert probably didn't even have
 maybe they just barely had fire uh they would understand if a 747 flew

Speaker 0 :overhead
 in in in this vicinity but not um if the if a 747 flew on marsbecause they wouldn't be able to see far
 because we're not actually communicating that wellwith the rest of the universe we're
 doing okay we're just sending out random like50s tracks of music true


Speaker 1 :and yeah i mean they'd have to you know
 the we've only been broadcasting radio waves forum 150 years and well there's your light
 cone

Speaker 0 :so yeah okay what do you make about all
 the i recently came across this uh havingtalked to
 david fravor i don't know if you caught what thethe videos that pentagon released and
 uh the new york times reporting of the ufo sightingsso i kind of looked into it quote
 unquote and there's actually been likehundreds of thousands of ufo sightings
 right and a lot of it you can explain away indifferent kinds of ways
 so one is it could be interesting physical phenomenatwo it could be people wanting to
 believe and therefore they conjure up a lot ofdifferent things that just you know when
 you see different kinds of lights some basic physics phenomenaand then you just conjure up ideas of
 possible out there mysterious worlds but you knowit's also possible like you have a case
 of david fravor who is a navy pilotwho's you know as legit as a guest in
 terms of humans who are able to perceivethings in the environment and make
 conclusions whether those things are a threat or notand he and several other pilots saw
 a thing i don't know if you followed this but they saw a thing that they'vesince then called tick tock that moved
 in all kinds of weird ways they don't know what it is it could betechnology developed by by the united
 states and they're just not aware of it and thesurface level from the navy right it
 could be different kind of lighting technology ordrone technology all that kind of stuff
 it could be the russians and then chinese all that kind of stuffand of course their mind our mind
 can also venture into the possibility that it's from another worldhave you looked into this at all what do


Speaker 1 :you think about it
 i think all the news is a psyop i think that the most closing is realyeah i listened to the uh i think it was
 bob lazar um on joe rogan and like i believeeverything this guy is saying and then i
 think that it's probably just some like mk ultra kind of thing you know

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :uh what do you mean like they they uh
 you know they made some weird thing and they called it an alien spaceship youknow maybe it was just to like
 stimulate young physicist minds we'll tell them it's alien technology andwe'll see what they come up with right


Speaker 0 :do you find any conspiracy theories
 compelling like have you pulled at the string of the of the richcomplex world of conspiracy theories
 that's out there

Speaker 1 :i think that uh i've heard a conspiracy
 theory that conspiracy theories were invented by the ciain the 60s to discredit true things yeah
 um so you know you can go to ridiculous conspiracy theories like flat earth andpizzagate
 and uh you know these things are almost to hide likeconspiracy theories that like you know
 remember when the chinese like locked up the doctors who discovered coronaviruslike i tell people this and i'm like
 no no that's not a conspiracy theory that actually happeneddo you remember the time that the money
 used to be backed by gold and now it's backed by nothing this is not aconspiracy theory this actually


Speaker 0 :happened that's one of my worries
 today with the idea of fake news is that when nothing is realthen like you dilute the possibility of
 anything being true by conjuring up all kinds of conspiracytheories and then you don't know what to
 believe and then like the idea of truth of objectivity islost completely
 everybody has their own truth so you

Speaker 1 :used to control information by censoring
 it then the internet happened andgovernments are like oh we can't
 censor things anymore i know what we'll do you know it's theold story
 of uh the story of like tying a flag where the leprechaun tells you the goldis buried
 and you tie one flag and you make the leprechaun swear to not remove the flagand you come back to the field later
 with a shovel and there's flags

Speaker 0 :everywhere
 that's one way to maintain privacy right is likein order to protect the contents of this
 conversation for example we could just generate like millions of deep fakeconversations where you and i talk
 and say random things yeah so this is just one of them and nobody knows whichone was the real one
 this this could be fake right now

Speaker 1 :classic steganography technique


Speaker 0 :okay another absurd question about
 intelligent life because uh you know you're you're an incredibleprogrammer outside of everything else
 we'll talk about just as a programmer uh do you think intelligent beings outthere the civilizations that were out
 there had computers and programmingdid they do we naturally have to develop
 something where we engineer machines and are able to encode bothknowledge into those machines and
 instructions that process that knowledge process thatinformation to to make decisions and
 actions and so on and with those programming languages ifyou think they exist
 be at all similar to anything we've developed

Speaker 1 :so i don't see that much of a difference
 between quote-unquote natural languages and

Speaker 0 :programming languages


Speaker 1 :um yeah i think there's so many
 similarities so when asked the question what do alienlanguages look like
 i imagine they're not all that dissimilar from oursand i think translating in and out of
 them uh wouldn't be that crazy well it's

Speaker 0 :difficult to compile
 like dna to python and then to see i mean there is a little bit of a gap inin the kind of languages we use for
 for uh touring machines and the kind of languagesnature seems to use a little bit maybe
 that's just we just haven't cr we haven't understoodthe kind of language that nature uses
 well

Speaker 1 :yet dna is a cad model
 it's not quite a programming language it has no sort ofserial execution it's not quite a
 yeah it's a cad model um so i think in that sensewe actually completely understand it the
 problem is um you know well simulating on these cad models iplayed with it a bit this year
 is super uh computationally intensive if you want to go down to like themolecular level
 um where you need to go to see a lot of these phenomena like protein foldingum so yeah it's not that it's it's not
 it's not that we don't understand it it just requires a whole lot of compute tokind of


Speaker 0 :compile it for our human minds it's
 inefficient both for the pro for the data representation and for the

Speaker 1 :programming yeah it runs well on raw
 nature it runs well in raw nature and when wetry to build uh emulators or simulators
 for that uh well then manslaughter and i've tried

Speaker 0 :it
 it runs in yeah you've commented elsewherei don't remember where that uh
 one of the problems is simulating nature is toughand if you want to sort of deploy a
 prototype i forgot how you you put it but it mademe laugh but animals or humans would
 need to be involved in order to in order to try to run someprototype code on um
 like if we're talking about covid and viruses and so on yeahif you were trying to engineer some kind
 of defense mechanisms like a vaccine uh against coven orall that kind of stuff that doing any
 kind of experimentation like you can with like autonomous vehicles would bevery
 technically cost technically and

Speaker 1 :ethically costly i'm not sure about that
 i think you can do tons of uh crazy biology and in test tubes ithink
 my bigger complaint is more all the tools are so bad

Speaker 0 :like literally you mean like like i'm


Speaker 1 :not libraries and i'm not pipetting
 like you're handing me a i gotta no no no no there has to be some

Speaker 0 :like automating stuff and like the
 yeah but human biology is messy like it

Speaker 1 :seems like
 look at those toronto's videos they were a joke it's like it's like a littlegantry it's like a little xy gantry high
 school science project with the pipette i'm like

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :really gotta be something better you
 can't build like nice microfluidics and i can program the you knowcomputation to bio interface i mean this
 is going to happen but like right now if you are asking meto pipette
 50 milliliters of solution amount

Speaker 0 :this is so crude yeah okay
 let's get all the crazy out of the way uh so a bunch of people ask mesince we talked about the simulation
 last time we talked about hacking the simulationdo you have any updates any insights
 about how we might be able to go about hacking simulation if we indeed do livein a simulation


Speaker 1 :i think a lot of people misinterpreted
 the point of that south by talk the point of the south by talk was notliterally to hack the simulation
 uh i think that this we this is this is an idea is literallyjust i think theoretical physics i think
 that's the whole you know the whole goalright you want your grand unified theory
 but then okay build a brand new five theory search for exploitsright i think we're nowhere near
 actually there yet my hope with that was just more to likelike are you people kidding me with the
 things you spend time thinking about do you understand like kind of how smallyou are
 you are you are bites and god's computer really and the things that people getworked up about and


Speaker 0 :you know so basically it was more
 a message of uh we should humble ourselvesthat we we get to uh like what
 what are we humans in this bite code

Speaker 1 :yeah
 and not just just humble ourselves but like like i'm not trying to like makeyou feel guilty or anything like that
 i'm trying to say like literally look at what you are spending time on

Speaker 0 :right what are you referring to you're
 referring to the kardashians what are we talking about

Speaker 1 :from twitter to no the kardashians see
 everyone knows that's kind of fun i'm referring more to like theeconomy
 you know this idea that

Speaker 0 :we gotta up our stock price like


Speaker 1 :or or what is what is the goal function
 of humanity

Speaker 0 :you don't like the game of capitalism
 like you don't like the games we've constructed for ourselves as humans

Speaker 1 :i'm a big fan of of capitalism i don't
 think that's really the game we're playing right now i think we're playinga
 a different game where the rules are

Speaker 0 :rigged
 look at which games are interesting to you that we humans have constructed andwhich aren't
 which are productive and which

Speaker 1 :are not actually maybe that's the real
 point of the of the talk it's like stop playing thesefake human games there's a real game
 here we can play the real game the real gameis you know nature wrote the rules
 this is a real game there still is a game to play

Speaker 0 :but if you look at sergeant drop i don't
 know if you've seen the instagram account nature is metalthe game that nature seems to be playing
 is a lot a lot more cruel than we humans want toput up with or
 at least we see it as cool it's like the biggerthing eats the smaller thing and uh
 does it to impress another big thing so it can mate with that thing andthat's it that
 seems to be the entirety of it well there's no art there's no music there'sno
 comma ai there's no comma one no comma two no georgehotz with his brilliant talks at south
 by southwest

Speaker 1 :see i disagree though i disagree that
 this is what nature is i think nature just provided basically a uhopen world and mmorpg and um
 you know here it's open world i mean if that's the game you want to play you canplay that game but


Speaker 0 :isn't that isn't that beautiful i know
 if you play diablo they used to have uh i think cow levelwhere it's
 so everybody will go just they figured out this like the best way to gainlike experience points is to just
 slaughter cows over and over and over and uh so they figured out this littlesub game within the bigger game that
 this is the most efficient way to get experience points and everybodysomehow agreed that getting experience
 points in rpg context where you always want to begetting more stuff
 more skills more levels keep advancing that seems to be goodso might as well spend sacrifice
 actual enjoyment of playing a game exploring a worldand spending like hundreds of hours of
 your time in cow level i mean the number of hours i spent in cow leveli'm not like the most impressive person
 because people have probably thousands of hours there but it's ridiculousso that's a little absurd game that
 brought me joy in some weird dopamine drug kind of wayyeah so you you don't like those games
 you don't you don't think that's us humans failingthe the yeah nature i think so
 and that was the point of the talk yeah so how do we hack it then

Speaker 1 :well i want to live forever and wait
 i want to live forever and this is like the goal well that's a game againstnature


Speaker 0 :yeah immortality is the good objective


Speaker 1 :function to you
 i mean start there and then you can do whatever else you want cause you got a

Speaker 0 :long time
 what if mortality makes the game just totally not funi mean like why do you assume
 immortality is uh somehow uh it's nota good objective function it's not


Speaker 1 :immortality that i want a true
 immortality where i could not die i would prefer what we have right now umbut i want to choose my own death of
 course i don't want nature to decide when i diei'm going to win i'm going to be you


Speaker 0 :and then at some point if you choose
 commit suicide like how long you think you'd live

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :until i get bored see i don't think
 people like in like brilliant people like youthat really
 ponder living a long time are really considering howhow meaningless life becomes well i want


Speaker 1 :to know everything and then i'm ready
 to die

Speaker 0 :as long as why do you want isn't it
 possible that you want to know everything becauseit's finite like the reason you want to
 know quote unquote everything is because you don't have enough time to knoweverything
 and once you have unlimited time then you realize likewhy do anything like why learn anything


Speaker 1 :i want to know everything and i'm ready


Speaker 0 :to die so you have yeah


Speaker 1 :well it's not it's not a like it's a
 terminal value it's not it's not in service of anything else i'm

Speaker 0 :conscious of the possibility this is not
 a certainty but the possibility is of that engine ofcuriosity that you're speaking to
 is actually a a symptom of uh the finiteness of lifelike
 without that finiteness your curiosity would vanish like like alike a morning fog
 all right cool then you talked about

Speaker 1 :love like that then um
 let me solve immortality let me change the thing in my brain that reminds me ofthe fact that i'm immortal tells me that
 life is finite maybe i'll have it tell me that life ends next weekright i'm okay with some self
 manipulation like that i'm okay with with deceiving oh change

Speaker 0 :oh rico changing the code if that's the


Speaker 1 :problem right if the problem is that i
 will no longer have that that curiosity i'd like to have backupcopies of myself
 uh which yeah well which i check in with occasionally to make sure they're okaywith the trajectory and they can kind of
 override it maybe a nice like i think of like thosewavenets those like logarithmic go back


Speaker 0 :to the copies yeah but sometimes it's
 not reversible like uh sure i've done this with video gameswhen once you figure out the cheat code
 or like you look up how to cheat old school like singleplayer


Speaker 1 :it ruins the game for you absolutely i
 know that feeling but again that just means our brain manipulationtechnology is not good enough yet remove
 that cheat code from your brain

Speaker 0 :what if we all so it's also possible
 that if we figure out immortality that all of us will kill ourselvesbefore we advance
 far enough to uh to be able to revert to change

Speaker 1 :i'm not killing myself till i know
 everything so

Speaker 0 :that's what you say now because your


Speaker 1 :life is finite
 you know i think yes self-modifying systems getscomes up with all these hairy
 complexities and can i promise that i'll do it perfectly no but i think i can putgood safety structures in place


Speaker 0 :so that talk in your thinking here is
 not literally referring to uh a simulation in that ourour universe is a kind of computer
 program running in a computer that's more of a thought experiment umdo you also think of the potential of
 the sort of uh bostrom elon muskand others that talk about an actual
 program that simulates our universe oh i don't

Speaker 1 :doubt that we're in a simulation i just
 think that it's not quite that important i mean i'minterested only in simulation theory as
 far as like it gives me power over nature uh if it's totallyunfalsifiable then


Speaker 0 :who cares i mean what do you think that
 experiment would look like like somebody uhon twitter asked ask george what signs
 we would look for to know whether or not we're in the simulationwhich is exactly what you're asking is
 like the step that precedes the step ofknowing how to get more power
 from this knowledge is to get an indication that there is some power tobe gained so
 get an indication that there you can discoverand exploit cracks in the simulation or
 it doesn't you know in the physics of the universe

Speaker 1 :yeah
 show me i mean like a memory leak would be coollike some scrying technology you know
 what what kind of technology scrying what's that oh that's a weird uhthis crying is the
 is the uh paranormal ability to uh like like remote viewing like being ableto see somewhere where you're not
 um so you know i don't think you can do it by chanting in a room but umif we could find as a memory leak
 basically

Speaker 0 :yeah you're able to access parts you're
 not supposed to yeah yeah yeah and thereby discover shortcut

Speaker 1 :yeah maybe memory leak means the other
 thing as well but i mean like yeah like an ability to read arbitrary memoryyeah right and that one's not that
 horrifying right the the right ones start to be horrifying

Speaker 0 :read right so the the reading is not the
 problem yeah

Speaker 1 :it's like heartbleed for the universe oh


Speaker 0 :boy the writing is a big big problem
 it's a big problem it's the moment you can write anything even if it's justrandom noise that's terrifying


Speaker 1 :i mean even without even without that
 like even some of the you know the nanotech stuff that's coming i think is

Speaker 0 :i don't know if you're paying attention
 but actually eric weinstein came out with the theory of everythingi mean that came out he's been working
 on a theory of everything in the physics worldcalled geometric community and then for
 me from computer science person like you stephen wolfram's theory ofeverything of like hypographs is super
 interesting and beautiful but not from a physics perspective butfrom a computational perspective i don't
 know have you paid attention

Speaker 1 :to any of that so again like what would
 make me pay attention and like why like i hate string theory is okay make atestable prediction
 right i'm only interested in i'm not interested in theories for theirintrinsic beauty i'm interested in
 theories that give me power over the universeso if these theories do i'm very
 interested um can i just say how

Speaker 0 :beautiful that
 is because a lot of physicists say i'm interested in experimental validationand they skip out the part
 where they say to give me more power in the universei just love the um yo i want i want i


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :want the clarity of that
 i want 100 gigahertz processors i want transistors that are smaller than atomsi want like


Speaker 0 :power
 that's uh that's true and that's where peoplefrom aliens to this kind of technology
 where people are worried that governments like who owns that poweris it george hearts is it thousands of
 distributed hackers across the world is it governments you know is it markzuckerberg
 there's a lot of people that uh i don't know if anyone trusts any oneindividual with power so they're always
 worried

Speaker 1 :it's the beauty of blockchains that's


Speaker 0 :the beauty of blockchains
 which we'll talk about on twitter somebody pointed me to a story uha bunch of people pointed me to a story
 a few months ago where you went into a restaurant in newyork and you can correct me fame this is
 wrong and ran into a bunch of folks from acompany in a
 crypto company who are trying to scale up ethereumand they had a technical deadline
 related to a solidity to ovm compiler so these are all ethereum technologiesso
 you stepped in they recognized you uh pulled you aside explained their problemand you stepped in and helped them solve
 the problem uh thereby creating legend statusstory so uh can you uh
 tell me the story the little more detail it seems kind of incrediblethis did this happen yeah yeah it's a


Speaker 1 :true story it's a true story i mean they
 wrote a very flattering account of it um theyso optimism is the spin the company's
 called optimism spin-off of plasma they're trying tobuild l2 solutions on ethereum
 so right now uh every ethereum node has to run everytransaction
 on the ethereum network um and this kind of doesn't scale right because if youhave n computers
 well you know if that becomes two n computers you actually still get thesame amount of compute
 right this is this is like like o of one scalingum because they all have to run it okay
 fine you get more blockchain security but like theblockchain's already so secure
 can we trade some of that off for speed uh so that's kind of what these l2solutions are
 they built this thing which kind of um kind of sandboxuh for ethereum contracts so they can
 run it in this l2 world and it can't do certain things in l world

Speaker 0 :in l1 i can ask you for some definitions
 what's l2

Speaker 1 :oh l2 is layer 2. so l1 is like the base
 ethereum chain and then layer two is like acomputational layer that runs
 um elsewhere but still is kind of secured by layer one

Speaker 0 :and i'm sure a lot of people know but
 ethereum is a cryptocurrency probably one of the most popular cryptocurrenciessecond to bitcoin
 and a lot of interesting technological innovations theremaybe you can also slip in
 whenever you talk about this any things that are exciting to you in theethereum space and why ethereum well i


Speaker 1 :mean
 bitcoin uh is not turn complete well ethereum is not technically aterrain complete with a gas limit but
 close enough

Speaker 0 :well the gas limit what's the gas limit


Speaker 1 :resources
 yeah i mean no computers actually turn complete right rightyou're fine at ram you know what if i


Speaker 0 :can actually solve this gas limit you
 just have so many brilliant words i'm not even gonna ask but that's

Speaker 1 :what that's no that's not my word that's
 ethereum's word gasoline ethereum you have to spend gasper instruction
 so like different op codes use different amounts of gas and youbuy gas with ether to prevent people
 from basically ddosing the network

Speaker 0 :so uh bitcoin is proof of work and then


Speaker 1 :what's ethereum it's also proof of work
 uh they're working on some proof-of-stake ethereum 2.0 stuff butright now it's
 it's proof of work usually a different hash function from bitcoin that's moreasic resistance because you need ram


Speaker 0 :so we're all talking about ethereum 1.0
 yeah so what uh what were they trying to do to scalethis whole process so they were like


Speaker 1 :well
 if we could run contracts elsewhere um and then only save the results of thatcomputation
 uh you know well we don't actually have to do the computer on the chain we cando the compute off chain and just post
 what the results are now the problem with that is wellsomebody could lie about what the
 results are so you need a resolution mechanism andthe resolution mechanism can be really
 expensive uh because you know you just have tomake sure that like
 the person who is saying look i swear that this is the real computationi'm staking ten thousand dollars on that
 fact and if you prove it wrong yeah it might costyou three thousand dollars in gas fees
 to prove wrong but you'll get the ten thousand dollarbounty so you can secure
 using those kind of systems um so it's effectively a sandbox which runscontracts
 uh and like just like any kind of normal sandbox you have to like replacesyscalls with um you know calls into the
 hypervisor

Speaker 0 :uh sandbox this calls hypervisor what do
 these things mean uh as long as it's interesting to talk

Speaker 1 :about yeah i mean you can take like the
 chrome is maybe the one to think about right sothe chrome process that's doing a
 rendering uh can't for example read a file fromthe file system yeah
 it has if it tries to make an open syscall in linux the open systemyou can't make it open says call no no
 no uh you have to request from the kind of uh hypervisor processor
 like i don't know what's called in chrome but umthe canoe hey could you open this file
 for me and then it does all these checks and then it passes the file handle backin if it's approved
 um so that's yeah uh so what's the in

Speaker 0 :the context of ethereum
 what are the boundaries of the sandbox

Speaker 1 :that we're talking about um well like
 one of the calls that you actually reading and uh writing anystate to the ethereum contract
 to the ethereum blockchain um writing state is one of those calls thatyou're going to have to sandbox
 in layer two because if you let layer two justarbitrarily right to the ethereum
 blockchain um

Speaker 0 :so layer two is except is really sitting
 on top of layer one so you're gonna have a lot ofdifferent kinds of ideas that you can
 play with yeah and they're all they're notfundamentally changing
 the source code level of ethereum

Speaker 1 :well you have to replace a bunch of
 calls with calls into the hypervisor soinstead of doing the syscall directly
 you you replace it with a call to the hypervisorso originally they were doing this by
 first running the so solidity is the language that most ethereum contractsare written in
 it compiles to a byte code and then they wrote this thing they called thetranspiler and the transpiler took the
 byte code and it transpiled it into ovm safebytecode
 basically bytecode that didn't make any of those restricted syscalls and addedthe calls to the hypervisor
 this transpiler was a 3000 line mess and it's hard to do it's hard to do ifyou're trying to do it like that because
 you have to kind of like deconstruct the byte codechange things about it and then
 reconstruct it and i mean as soon as i hear this i'mlike why don't you just change the
 compiler right why not the first place you buildthe bytecode just do it in the compiler
 uh so yeah you know i asked them how much they wanted ituh of course measured in dollars and i'm
 like well okay

Speaker 0 :um and yeah and you wrote the compiler


Speaker 1 :yeah i modified i wrote a 300 line diff
 to the compiler uh it's open source you can look at it

Speaker 0 :yeah it's yeah i looked at the code last
 night [Laughter]yeah exactly cute good is a good word
 for it uh and it's um c plus plus

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :see if it's lost yeah so when
 asked how you were able to do it you saidyou just gotta think and then do it
 right so can you break that apart a little bitwhat's what's your process of uh
 one thinking and two doing it right

Speaker 1 :you know they they the people i was
 working for are amused that i said that it doesn't really mean anything

Speaker 0 :okay i mean is there some
 deep profound insights to draw from like how you problem solve from that because

Speaker 1 :this is always what i say i'm like do
 you want to be a good programmer do it for 20 years

Speaker 0 :yeah there's no shortcuts yeah
 what are your thoughts on crypto in general so wouldwhat what parts technically or
 philosophically do you find especially beautiful maybe

Speaker 1 :oh i'm extremely bullish on crypto long
 term not any specific crypto project but this idea ofwell two ideas one um
 the nakamoto consensus algorithm is i think one of the greatest innovationsof the 21st century
 this idea that people can reach consensus you can reach a groupconsensus
 using a relatively straightforward algorithmum is wild and
 like you know satoshi nakamoto people always ask me who i look up to it's like

Speaker 0 :whoever that is who do you think it is i
 mean

Speaker 1 :elon musk is it you it is definitely not
 me and i do not think it's elon musk but yeah this idea of uhgroups reaching consensus in a
 decentralized yet formulaic way is one extremely powerful idea fromcrypto
 maybe the second idea is this idea of smart contractswhen you write a contract between two
 parties any contract um this contractif there are disputes it's interpreted
 by lawyers lawyers are just really shitty overpaidinterpreters
 imagine you had let's talk about them in terms of a in terms of like let'scompare a lawyer to python
 right so lawyer well okay that's really

Speaker 0 :oh i never thought of it that way it's
 hilarious

Speaker 1 :so python i'm paying i'm paying um
 you know even 10 cents an hour i'll use the nice azure machine i can run pythonfor 10 cents an hour
 lawyers cost a thousand dollars an hour so python is is is10 000 x uh better on that axis um
 lawyers don't always return the same answerum python almost always does
 uh cost yeah i mean just just cost reliabilityeverything about python is so much
 better than lawyers um so if you can make smart contractsthis whole concept of code is law
 i i love and i would love to live in a world where everybody accepted that fact

Speaker 0 :so so maybe uh you can talk about what
 smart contracts

Speaker 1 :are so let's say um
 let's say you know we have a uh even something as simple as a safetydeposit box
 right safety deposit box that holds a million dollarsi have a contract with the bank that
 says two out of these three parties uh must uh be present to open the safetydeposit box and get the money out
 so that's a contract for the bank and it's only as good as the bank and thelawyers right
 let's say you know somebody dies and now oh we're going to go through a big legaldispute about whether oh well was it in
 the will was it not in the well what like it's just so messy and thecost
 to determine truth is so expensive versus a smart contract which just usescryptography to check if two out of
 three keys are present well i can look at that and i can havecertainty
 in the answer that it's going to return that's what all businesses wantcertainty you know they say businesses
 don't care viacom youtube youtube's like look we don't care whichway this lawsuit goes
 just please tell us so we can have

Speaker 0 :certainty yeah i wonder how many
 agreements in this world because we're talking about financial transactionsonly in this case correct the smart the


Speaker 1 :smart contracts oh you can go to you can
 go to anything you can go you could put a prenup in thetheorem blockchain


Speaker 0 :a married smart contract sorry divorce


Speaker 1 :lawyers sorry you're going gonna be
 replaced by

Speaker 0 :python uh
 okay so that's uh so that's that's another beautiful ideado you think
 there's something that's appealing to you about any one specificimplementation
 so if you look 10 20 50 years down the linedo you see any like bitcoin ethereum
 any of the other hundreds of cryptocurrencies winning out is therelike what's your intuition about the
 space are you just sitting back and watching the chaos and look who careswhat emerges


Speaker 1 :oh i don't i don't speculate i don't
 really care i don't really care which one of these projects winsi'm kind of in the bitcoin as a meme
 coin camp i mean why does bitcoin have valueit's technically kind of you know
 what yeah not great like the block size debate orwhen i found out what the block size
 debate was i'm like are you guys

Speaker 0 :kidding what's the block size debate


Speaker 1 :you know what it's really it's too
 stupid to even talk about people people people can look it up but i'mlike wow you know ethereum seems the
 governance of ethereum seems much better um i've come around i've been on proofof stake ideas
 uh you know very smart people thinking

Speaker 0 :about some things yeah
 you know governance is interesting it does feel like uhvitalik it could just feel like an
 open in even in these distributed systems leaders andare helpful because they kind of
 help you drive the mission and the visionand they put a face to a project it's a
 weird thing about us humans

Speaker 1 :geniuses are helpful like mattel right


Speaker 0 :yeah
 brilliant

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :leaders are not necessarily yeah
 so you think the reason he's uh he's the faceof a theorem is because he's a genius
 that's interesting i mean that was umit's interesting to think about that we
 need to create systems in which uh the quote unquote leadersthat emerge
 are the geniuses in the system i mean that'sarguably why the current state of
 democracy is broken is the people who areemerging as the leaders are not the most
 competent are not the superstars of the systemand it seems like at least for now in
 the crypto world oftentimes

Speaker 1 :the leaders are the superstars imagine
 at the debate they asked what's the sixth amendment what are thefour fundamental forces in the universe
 right what's the integral of two to the xyeah i i'd love to see those questions
 asked and that's what i want as our leaderit's it's a little bit of a bayes rule


Speaker 0 :yeah i mean even oh wow you're hurting
 my brain it's that my standard was even lower buti would have loved to see just this
 basic brilliance like i've talked tohistorians there's just these
 they're not even like they don't have a phd or even education history they justlike a dan carlin type character who
 just like holy how did all this informationget into your head
 they're able to just connect uh genghis khan tothe entirety of the history of the 20th
 century they they know everything about every singlebattle that happened
 and they know the the the like the game of thrones of the of thedifferent power plays and all that
 happened there and they know like the individuals theyknow all the documents involved
 and it's and that they integrate that into their regular life it's not likethey're ultra history nerds they're just
 they know this information that's what competence looks like yeahbecause i've seen that with programmers
 too right that's what great programmers dobut yeah it would be uh it's really
 unfortunate that those kinds of people aren't emerging as as our leaders butfor
 now at least in the crypto world that seems to be the casei don't know if that always uh you could
 imagine that in a hundred years that's

Speaker 1 :not the case right the crypto world has
 one very powerful idea going for it and that's the idea of forksright i mean
 you know imagine uh we'll use a less controversial exampleum this was actually in my joke
 uh app in 2012 i was like barack obama mitt romney let's let him both bepresident right like imagine we could
 fork america and just let them both be president andthen the americas could compete
 and you know people could invest in one pull their liquidity out of one put itin the other
 you have this in the crypto world ethereum forks into ethereum andethereum classic
 and you can pull your liquidity out of one and put it in anotherand people vote with their dollars um
 which forks companies should be able to forki'd love to fork nvidia you know


Speaker 0 :yeah like different business strategies
 and yeah and then try them out and see see what works like even take uhuh yeah take comedy i that closes its
 source and then take one that's open source andsee what works
 take one that's purchased by gm and one that remainsandroid renegade and all these different
 versions and see the beauty of comma ai

Speaker 1 :is someone could actually do that
 yeah please take come ai and fork it

Speaker 0 :that's right
 that's the beauty of open source so you're i meanwe'll talk about autonomous vehicle
 space but it does seem that you're really knowledgeable abouta lot of different topics so the natural
 question a bunch of people ask this which isuh how do you keep learning new things
 do you have like practical advice if you were tointrospect
 like taking notes allocate time or do you just mess around and justallow your curiosity to drive i'll write


Speaker 1 :these people a self-help book and i'll
 charge 67 for it and i will i will write i willwrite chapter one i will write on the
 cover of the self-help book all of this advice is completelymeaningless you're gonna be a sucker and
 buy this book anyway yeah and the one lesson that i hope theytake away from the book
 is that i can't give you a meaningful

Speaker 0 :answer to that
 that's interesting let me translate that is you haven't really thought about whatit is you do
 systematically because you could reduce it and there's some people i mean i'vemet
 brilliant people that this is really clear with athletessome are just you know the best in the
 world that's something and they they have zero interest inwriting like a self-help book
 but or how to master this game and then there'ssome athletes who become great coaches
 and they love the analysis perhaps the over analysis and you rightnow at least at your age
 which isn't interesting you're in the middle of the battle you're like thewarriors that have zero interest in
 writing books uh so you're in the middle of the battleso you have yeah


Speaker 1 :this is this is a fair point i do think
 i have a certain aversion to um this kind of deliberateintentional way of living life


Speaker 0 :here eventually the hilarity of this
 especially since this is recordedit will reveal beautifully the absurdity
 when you finally do publish this book and i guarantee you you will the storyof comma ai
 would be maybe it'll be a biography written about youthey'll be they'll be better i guess and


Speaker 1 :you might be able to learn some cute
 lessons if you're starting a company like comma ai from that bookbut if you're asking generic questions
 like how do i be good at things dude i don't know well learn i mean the

Speaker 0 :interesting do them a lot
 i do them a lot but the interesting thing here islearning things outside
 of your current trajectory which is what it feels like from an outsider'sperspective i mean that
 uh you know that i don't know if there's an advice on thatbut it is an interesting curiosity when
 you become really busy

Speaker 1 :you're running a company


Speaker 0 :part time yeah
 but like there's a natural inclination andtrend like just the the the momentum of
 life carries you into a particular directionof wanting to focus and this kind of
 dispersion that curiosity can lead to gets harder and harder with time becauseyou're
 you get really good at certain things and it suckstrying things that you're not good at
 like trying to figure them out you do this with your live streamsyou're on the
 fly figuring stuff out you don't mind looking dumbyou just figured out figure it out


Speaker 1 :pretty quickly sometimes i try things
 and i don't figure them out my chest rating is like a 1400 despiteputting like
 a couple hundred hours in it's pathetic i mean to be fair i know that i could doit better if i did it better like don't
 play you know don't play five-minute games play 15-minute games at least likei know these things but it just doesn't
 it doesn't stick nicely in my knowledge

Speaker 0 :tree
 all right let's talk about comma ai what's the mission of the companylet's like look at the biggest picture


Speaker 1 :oh i have an exact statement
 solve self-driving cars while delivering shippable intermediaries

Speaker 0 :so long-term vision is have
 fully autonomous vehicles and make sure you're making money along the way

Speaker 1 :i think it doesn't really speak to money
 but i can talk i can talk about what solve self-driving cars meanssolve self-driving cars of course means
 um you're not building a new car you'rebuilding a person replacement
 uh that person can sit in the driver's seat and drive you anywhere a person candrive
 with a human or better level of safety speed quality comfort

Speaker 0 :and what's the second part of that


Speaker 1 :delivering shippable intermediaries
 um is well it's a way to fund the company that's true but it's also a wayto keep us honest
 uh if you don't have that it is very easywith this technology to think you're
 making progress when you're not i've heard it best described on hackernews as
 you can set any arbitrary milestone meet that milestone and still beinfinitely far away from solving
 self-driving cars

Speaker 0 :so it's hard to have like real deadlines
 when you're like cruz or waymowhen uh you don't have uh revenue
 is that i mean is revenue essentially the thing we're talking about here

Speaker 1 :revenue is
 is capitalism is based around consent capitalism the way that you get revenueis kind of
 real capitalism commas in the real capital is in camp there's definitelyscams out there but
 real capitalism is based around consent it's based around this idea that like ifwe're getting revenue
 it's because we're providing at least that much value another person whensomeone buys a thousand dollar comment
 two from us we're providing them at least a thousanddollars of value where they wouldn't buy
 it brilliant

Speaker 0 :so can you give a whirlwind overview of
 the products that come i provides like uh throughout its historyand today


Speaker 1 :i mean yeah the past ones aren't really
 that interesting it's kind of just been refinement of the same idea uhthe real only product we sell today is
 the comma two which is a piece of

Speaker 0 :hardware


Speaker 1 :with cameras um so the comet to
 i mean you can think about it kind of like a person uh you know when futurehardware will probably be even more and
 more person-like um so it has uh you know eyesears a mouth a brain
 uh and a way to interface with the car

Speaker 0 :does it have consciousness
 just kidding that was a trick question because i don't have consciousness

Speaker 1 :either
 me and the common two are the same they're the same i have a little morecompute than it
 it only has like the same computer interesting b

Speaker 0 :uh you know you're more efficient energy
 wise

Speaker 1 :for the compute you're doing far more
 efficient energy-wise huh 20 paid flaps 20 watts crazy you

Speaker 0 :lack consciousness
 sure do you fear death you do you want immortalitydoes comey i fear death i don't think so


Speaker 1 :of course it does it very much fears
 while it fears negative loss oh yeah okay

Speaker 0 :so come a comma two when did that come
 out that that was a year ago

Speaker 1 :no two uh early this year


Speaker 0 :wow time it feels like yeah
 2020 feels like uh it's taken 10 years to get to the end it's a long yearit's a long year so um
 what uh what's the sexiest thing about commatoo feature-wise so i mean maybe you can
 also link on like what is it like what's its purposebecause there's a hardware there's a
 software component you've mentioned the sensors but alsolike what is of its features and
 capabilities

Speaker 1 :i think our slogan summarizes it well uh
 comma slogan is make driving chill

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :i love it okay yeah i mean it is
 you know if you like cruise control imagine cruise control but much much

Speaker 0 :more
 so it can uh do adaptive cruise control things which is like slow down for carsin front of it maintain a certain speed
 and you can also do lane keeping so staying in the laneand doing it better and better and
 better over time that's very much machine learning basedso this camera is there's a driver
 facing camera too that'sum what else is there what am i thinking
 so the hardware versus software so open pilot versus the actual hardware ofthe device
 what's can you draw that distinction what's one what's the other i mean the

Speaker 1 :hardware is pretty much
 a cell phone with a few additions a cell phone with a cooling systemand with a car interface connecting to
 it

Speaker 0 :and as by cell phone you mean uh like
 qualcomm snapdragon

Speaker 1 :uh yeah the current hardware is a
 snapdragon 821 uh it has wi-fi radio it has an lteradio it has a screen
 uh we use every part of the cell phone

Speaker 0 :and then the interface of the car is
 specific to the car so you keep supporting more and more cars

Speaker 1 :um yeah so the interface to the car i
 mean the device itself just has four can buseshas four cam interfaces on it that are
 connected through the usb port to the phoneum and then yeah on those four can buses
 uh you connect it to the car and there's a little harness to do thiscars are actually surprisingly similar


Speaker 0 :so can is the the protocol by which cars
 communicate and then you're able to read stuff andwrite stuff to be able to control the
 car depending on the car so what's thesoftware side what's open pilot


Speaker 1 :um so i mean open pilot is the hardware
 is pretty simple compared to open pilot open pilot isuh well
 so you have a machine learning model which it's an open pilot it's ayou know it's a blob it's just a blob of
 weights it's not like people are like oh it's closed source i'm like it's a blobof weights what do you expect
 um you know primarily neural network

Speaker 0 :based


Speaker 1 :ul open pilot is all the software kind
 of around that neural network that if you have a neural network that sayshere's where you want to send the car
 openpilot actually goes and executes all

Speaker 0 :of that
 it cleans up the input to the neural network it cleans up the output andexecutes on it so it connects
 it's the glue that connects everything

Speaker 1 :together runs the sensors does a bunch
 of calibration for the neural network does you know deals with like you knowif the car is on a banked road
 uh you have to counter steer against that and the neural network can'tnecessarily know that by looking at the
 picture so you do that with with other sensorsinfusion and localizer
 openpilot also is responsible for sending the data up to our servers so wecan learn from it
 logging it recording it running the cameras thermally managing the devicemanaging the disk space on the device
 managing all the resources of the device

Speaker 0 :so what um since we last spoke i don't
 remember when maybe a year ago maybe a little bit longerhow uh has open pilot improved we did


Speaker 1 :exactly what i promised you
 i promised you that by the end of the year you'd be able to remove the lanesum the lateral policy is now
 uh almost completely end to end you can turn the lanes off and it will drivedrive slightly worse on the highway if
 you turn the lanes off but you can turn the lanes off and it will drivewell trained completely end to end on
 user data um and this year we hope to do the same

Speaker 0 :for the longitudinal policy so that's
 the interesting thing is you're not doing you don't appear tobe you can correct me you don't appear
 to be doing lean detection or lane marking detection orkind of the segmentation task or
 any kind of object detection task you're doing what'straditionally more called like
 end-to-end learning so and trained on actual behavior ofdrivers
 when they're driving the car manually

Speaker 1 :and this is hard to do you know it's not
 supervised learning

Speaker 0 :yeah but uh so the nice thing is there's
 a lot of data so it's hard and easy right it's uh we have a lot of high

Speaker 1 :quality data yeah


Speaker 0 :like more than you need in the senate


Speaker 1 :well we way more than we do we have way
 more data than we need

Speaker 0 :i mean it's it's an interesting question
 actually because in terms of amount you have more thanyou need
 but the you know driving is full of edge cases so how do youselect the data you train on
 i i think this is an interesting open question like what'swhat's the cleverest way to select data
 that's the question tesla is probably working onuh that's i mean the entirety of machine
 learning can be they don't seem to really care they just kind of selectdata but i feel like that
 if you want to solve if you want to create intelligent systems you have topick data well
 right and so would you have any hints ideas of how to do it well

Speaker 1 :so in some ways that is the definition i
 like of reinforcement learning versus supervised learningin supervised learning the weights
 depend on the data right um and this is obviously true butthe
 uh in reinforcement learning the data depends on the weightsyeah right and actually both ways that's


Speaker 0 :that's poetry
 so it's brilliant how does it know what

Speaker 1 :data to turn on well let it pick
 we're not there yet but that's the

Speaker 0 :eventual so you're thinking this
 almost like a reinforcement learning

Speaker 1 :framework we're going to do rl on the
 world every time a car makes a mistake userdisengages we
 train on that and do our all in the world ship out a new model that's anepoch right


Speaker 0 :and uh for now you're not
 doing the elon style promising that it's going to be fully autonomous you reallyare sticking to level two
 and like it's supposed to be supervised

Speaker 1 :oh it is definitely supposed to be
 supervising reinforced the fact that it's supervisedum we look at our rate of improvement
 in disengagements um open pilot now has an unplanned engagement about every 100miles
 this is up from 10 miles like maybe maybe uhmaybe a year ago yeah so maybe we've
 seen 10x improvement in a year but a hundred miles is still a far cry fromthe hundred thousand you're going to
 need so you're going to somehow need to getum
 three more 10xs in there and your

Speaker 0 :what's your intuition uh you're
 basically hoping that there's exponential improvement built into thebaked into the cake somewhere well


Speaker 1 :that's even like i mean 10x improvement
 that's already assuming exponential right there's definitely exponentialimprovement and i think when elon talks
 about exponential like these things these systems are going toexponentially improve
 just exponential doesn't mean you're getting 100 gigahertz processorstomorrow
 right like it's going to still take a while because the gapbetween even our best system and humans
 is still large

Speaker 0 :so that's an interesting distinction to
 draw so if you look at the way tesla's approaching the problemand the way you're approaching the
 problem which is very different than the rest of theself-driving car world so let's put them
 aside is you're treating most the driving taskis a machine learning problem
 and the way tesla is approaching it is with the multi-task learningwhere you break the task of driving into
 hundreds of different desks and you have this multi-headed neuralnetwork that's very good at
 performing each task and there there's presumably something on top that'sstitching stuff together in order to uh
 make controlled decisions policy decisions about how you move the carbut what that allows you there's a
 brilliance to this because it allows you toum master each task like
 lane detection uh stop sign detection traffic light detection uh drivable areasegmentation
 uh you know vehicle bicycle pedestrian detectionuh there's some localization tasks in
 there also predicting oflike yeah predicting how the the
 entities in the scene are going to move like everything is basically a machinelearning task well there's a
 classification segmentation prediction andit's nice because you can have this
 entire engine data engine that's mining for edge casesfor each one of these tasks and you can
 have people like engineers that are basically masters of that tasklike becoming the best person in the
 world that uh as you talk about the cone guyfor uh for for waymo the good old phone
 guy the the becoming the best person in theworld at uh at uh
 at cone detection i i so that's a compelling notion from a supervisedlearning perspective
 automating much of the process of educates discovery and retraining neuralnetwork for each of the individual
 perception tasks and then you're looking at the machine learningin a more holistic way basically doing
 end-to-end learning on the driving task supervised trainedon the data of the actual
 driving of people that use comma ai like actual human drivers do manualcontrol plus the
 moments of disengagement that uh maybe with some labeling could indicatethe failure of the system so you have
 the you have a huge amount of data forpositive
 control of the vehicle like successful control of the vehicleboth maintaining the lane as as i think
 you're also working on longitudinal control of the vehicle andthen failure cases where the vehicle
 does something wrong that needs disengagementso like what why do you think you're
 right and tesla is wrong on this and do you think do you thinkyou'll come around the tesla way do you
 think tesla will come around

Speaker 1 :to your way if you were to start a chess
 engine company would you hire a bishop guy see we have

Speaker 0 :uh this is monday morning quarterbacking
 as uh yes probably [Laughter]

Speaker 1 :so oh oh our rook guy oh we stole the
 rook guy from that company oh we're gonna have real good

Speaker 0 :rooks well there's not many pieces right
 you can uh yeah there's not many guys and gals to hire you just have afew that work on the bishop a few that
 work in the rook

Speaker 1 :but is that not ludicrous today to think
 about in in the world of alpha zero

Speaker 0 :but alpha zero is jessica so the the
 fundamental question is how hard is driving compared to chessbecause so long term end to end
 will be the right solution the question is how many years away is that

Speaker 1 :end-to-end is going to be the only


Speaker 0 :solution for level five for the only way
 we can

Speaker 1 :of course and of course tesla's gonna
 come around to my way and if you're a rook guy out there i'm sorry

Speaker 0 :the cone guy i don't know we're gonna


Speaker 1 :specialize each task we're gonna really
 understand rook placement yeah i understand the

Speaker 0 :intuition you have
 i mean that that uh is very compelling notion thatwe can learn the task and to end
 like the same compelling notion you might have for natural languageconversation
 i'm not sure because one thing you sneaked in thereis the assertion that
 it's impossible to get to level five without this kind of approachi don't know if that's obvious i don't


Speaker 1 :know if that's obvious either i don't
 actually uh mean that i think that it is much easierto get to level five with an end-to-end
 approach i think that the other approach isdoable but the magnitude of the
 engineering challenge may exceed what humanity is capable of

Speaker 0 :so but what do you think of the tesla
 data engine approach which to me is an active learning task is kind offascinating
 is breaking it down into these multiple tasks andmining their data constantly for like
 edge cases for these different tasks but the tasks

Speaker 1 :themselves are not being learned this is
 feature engineering

Speaker 0 :yeah i mean it's it's a it's a higher
 abstraction level of feature engineering for the different tasksit's task engineering in a sense it's


Speaker 1 :slightly better feature engineering but
 it still fundamentally is feature engineeringand anything about the history of ai has
 taught us anything it's that feature engineering approacheswill always be replaced and lose
 to end to end now to be fair i cannot really make promises on timelinesbut i can say that when you look at the
 code for stockfish and the code for alpha zeroone is a lot shorter than the other a
 lot more elegant required a lot less programmer hours to write

Speaker 0 :yeah but there was a lot more murder
 of bad uh agents on the uh alpha zero sideby murder i mean uh agents that played a
 game and failed miserably yeah oh in simulation that failure isless costly yeah in in real world it's


Speaker 1 :wait do you mean in practice like alpha
 zero has lost games miserably

Speaker 0 :no well i haven't seen that no but i
 know but the the the the requirement for alpha zero is asimulator
 to be able to like evolution human evolutionnot human evolution biological evolution
 of life on earth from the origin of life has murdered trillions upon trillions oforganisms
 on the path to us humans yeah so the question is cancan we uh stitch together a human-like
 object without having to go through the entirety process of evolution

Speaker 1 :well no but do the evolution in


Speaker 0 :simulation yeah that's the question can
 we simulate so do you have a sense that's possible to simulate some

Speaker 1 :mu zero is exactly this mu zero is
 is the solution to this mu zero i think is going to look be looked backas the canonical paper and i don't think
 deep learning is everything i think that there's still a bunch of things missingto get there
 but mu zero i think is going to be looked back as the kind of cornerstonepaper
 um of this whole deep learning era and mu zero is the solution toself-driving cars you have to make a few
 tweaks to it but mu0 does effectively that it doesthose roll outs
 and those murdering in in a learned simulator in a learned dynamics model

Speaker 0 :it's interesting it doesn't get enough
 love i was blown away when i i was blown

Speaker 1 :away when i read that paper i'm like
 you know okay i've always had a comma i'm gonna sit and i'm gonna wait for thesolution to self-driving cars to come
 along

Speaker 0 :this year i saw it it's me zero yeah


Speaker 1 :so uh sit back and let the winning roll


Speaker 0 :in
 so your sense just to elaborate a little bitto link on the topic your senses in your
 networks will solve driving yes like we don't need anything else i

Speaker 1 :think the same way chess was maybe the
 chess and maybe google are the pinnacle of likesearch algorithms and things that look
 kind of like a star um the pinnacle ofthis era is going to be self-driving
 cars

Speaker 0 :but on the path of that you have to
 deliver products and it's possible that the path to fullself-driving cars


Speaker 1 :will take decades i doubt it so how long


Speaker 0 :would you put on it
 like what what are we you're chasing it tesla's chasing it what are we talkingabout five years 10 years


Speaker 1 :50 years in the 2020s in the 2020s
 the later part of the 2020s

Speaker 0 :with the neural network well that would
 be nice to see and on the path to that you're delivering productswhich is a nice l2 system that's what
 tesla's doing a nice l2 system i'm just

Speaker 1 :going to do better every time
 l2 the only difference between l2 and the other levels is who takes liabilityand
 i'm not a liability guy i want to take liability level 2 forever

Speaker 0 :now on that little transition i mean
 how do you make the transition work is uh is this where driver sensingcomes in like how do you make the
 because you said 100 miles like is is there somesort of human factor psychology thing
 where people start to over trust the system all those kinds ofeffects once it gets better and better
 and better and better they get lazier and lazier and lazieris that like how do you get that


Speaker 1 :transition right first off our
 monitoring is already adaptive our monitoring is already seen adaptive

Speaker 0 :driver monitoring
 is this the camera that's looking at the driver you have an infrared camera

Speaker 1 :in the our policy for
 how we enforce the driver monitoring is scene adaptive what's that meanwell for example in one of the extreme
 cases um if you uh if the car is not moving we donot
 uh actively enforce driver monitor right um if you are going through auh like a 45 mile an hour road with
 lights um and stop signs and potentiallypedestrians we enforce a very tight
 driver monitoring policy if you are alone on a perfectly straighthighway
 um and this is it's all machine learning none of that is hand codedactually the stop is hand coded but so


Speaker 0 :there's some kind of machine learning
 estimation of risk yes yeah i mean i've always been a huge fan of that thatthat's uh because it's difficult to do
 every step into that direction is a worthwhile step to take it might bedifficult to do really well like us
 humans are able to estimate risk pretty damn well whateverthe hell that is
 that feels like one of the nice features of us humansuh because like we humans are really
 good drivers when we're really like tuned in and we're good at estimatingrisk like when are we supposed to be
 tuned in

Speaker 1 :yeah and you know people are like oh
 well you know why would you ever make the driver monitoring policyless aggressive why would you always not
 keep it at its most aggressive because then people are just going to

Speaker 0 :get fatigued from it yes when they get
 annoyed you want them yeah you they want youwant the experience to be pleasant


Speaker 1 :obviously i want the experience to be
 pleasant but even just from a straight up safety perspectiveif you alert people when they look
 around and they're like why is this thing alerting me there'snothing i could possibly hit right now
 people will just learn to tune it out people will just learn to tune it out toput weights on the steering wheel to do
 whatever to overcome it and remember that you're always part ofthis adaptive system so
 all i can really say about you know how this scale is going forward is yeahsomething we have to monitor for
 we don't know this is a great psychology experiment at scale like we'll see

Speaker 0 :yeah it's fascinating track it and


Speaker 1 :making sure you have a good
 understanding of attention is a very key part of that psychology problem

Speaker 0 :yeah i think i mean you and i probably
 have a different come to it differently but to meit's an it's a fascinating psychology
 problem to explore something much deeper than just drivingit's a it's such a nice way to explore
 human attention and human behaviorwhich is why again we've probably both
 criticized mr elon musk on this one topic fromdifferent
 avenues uh so both offline and online i had little chats with elon andlike i love human beings as a as a
 as a computer vision problem as an ai problem it's fascinatinghe wasn't so much interested in that
 problem it's like in order to solve driving thewhole point is you want to remove the
 human from the picture and it seems like you can't do thatquite yet eventually yes but
 you can't quite do that yet so this is the moment where and you can'tyet say
 i told you so uh to tesla but it's getting there because i don'tknow if you've seen this there's some
 reporting that they're in fact starting to dodrive them off yeah they ship the model


Speaker 1 :in shadow mode


Speaker 0 :uh without uh i believe only a visible
 light camera it might even be fisheye uh it's like a low resolution low

Speaker 1 :resolution visible light
 i mean to be fair that's what we have in the eon as well our last generationproduct
 this is the one area where i can say our hardware's ahead of tesla the rest ofour hardware way way behind but our
 driver monitoring camera

Speaker 0 :do you think uh i think on the
 third row tesla podcast or somewhere else i've heard you say thatobviously eventually they're gonna have
 driver monitoring

Speaker 1 :i think what i've said is elon will
 definitely ship driver monitoring before he ships level five the beautiful leveland i'm willing to about 10 grand on


Speaker 0 :that and you better ground on that


Speaker 1 :uh i mean now i want to take the bet but
 before maybe someone would have i should have got my money

Speaker 0 :yeah that's an interesting bet i think i
 i think you're right i'm actually on a human level because he's beenhe's made the decision like he said that
 driver monitoring is the wrong way to go but like you have to think of as a humanas a ceo
 i think that's the right thing to say when likesometimes you have to say things
 publicly they're different than when you actually believebecause when you're producing a large
 number of vehicles and the decision was made not to includethe camera like what are you supposed to
 say yeah like our cars don't have the thingthat i think is right to have
 uh it's an interesting thing but like on the other side as a ceo i mean somethingyou could probably speak to
 as a leader i think about me as a human to publicly change your mind onsomething how hard is that
 well especially when like george haas say i told you so

Speaker 1 :all i will say is i am not a leader and
 i am happy to change my mind um and i think elon willyeah i do i think he'll come up with a
 good way to make it psychologically okay for him

Speaker 0 :well
 it's such an important thing man especially for a first principlesthinker because he made a decision
 that uh driver monitoring is not the right way to go and i could see thatdecision
 and i i could even make that decision like i was on the fencetoo like i'm not driving monitoring
 is such an obvious simple solution to the problem of attentionit's not obvious to me that just by
 putting a camera there you solve things you have to create anincredible compelling experience just
 like you're you're talking about and i don't know if it's easy to do thatit's not at all easy to do that in fact
 i think so as a creator of a car that's tryingto
 create a product that people love which is what tesla tries to do rightit's not obvious to me that uh you know
 as a design decision whether adding a camerais a good idea from a safety perspective
 either like in the human factors community everybodysays
 that like you should obviously have driver sensing driving monitoringbut like that
 that's like saying it's obvious as parents you shouldn't let your kids goout at night
 but okay but like they're still gonna find ways to dodrugs
 yeah you have to also be good parents so like it's it's much more complicatedthan just like
 you need to have drive and monitoring i

Speaker 1 :totally disagree on
 okay if you have a camera there and the camera's watching the personbut never throws an alert they'll never
 think about it right the the driver monitoring policythat you choose to how you choose to
 communicate with the user is entirely separate from the datacollection perspective right
 right so you know like there's one thing to say like you knowtell your teenager they can't do
 something there's another thing to like you knowgather the data so you can


Speaker 0 :make informed decisions that's really
 interesting but you have to make that that's the interesting thing about carsuh but even true with com ai
 like you don't have to manufacture the thing into the caris you have to make a decision that
 anticipates the right strategy long term so like youhave to start collecting the data
 and start making decisions starter date

Speaker 1 :started it three years ago
 i believe that we have the best driver monitoring solution in the worldum i think that when you compare it to
 well supercruise is the only other one that i really know that shipped

Speaker 0 :and ours is better what uh
 what do you like and not like about

Speaker 1 :super coos um i mean i had a few
 super crews uh the sun would be shining through the windowwould blind the camera and it would say
 i wasn't paying attention when i was looking completely straighti couldn't reset the attention with a
 steering wheel touch and supercrews would disengagelike i was communicating to the car i'm
 like look i'm here i'm paying attention why are you really gonna force me todisengage and
 it did um so it's it's a constant conversation with the user and yeahthere's no way to ship a system like
 this if you can ota right we're shipping a new one everymonth sometimes we we
 balance it with our users on discord like when sometimes we make the drivermonitoring a little more aggressive and
 people complain sometimes they don't you know we want itto be as aggressive as possible where
 people don't complain it doesn't feel intrusive

Speaker 0 :so being able to update the system over
 the air is an essential component i mean that's probably to me youmentioned uh
 i mean to me that is the biggest innovation of teslathat it it made it people realize that
 over-the-air updates is essential yeah i mean

Speaker 1 :yeah was that not obvious from the
 iphone the iphone was the first real product that ota'ed i think

Speaker 0 :was it actually that's that's brilliant


Speaker 1 :you're right i mean the game consoles
 used to not right the game consoles are maybe the secondthing that did well i didn't really


Speaker 0 :think about
 one of the amazing features of a smartphoneisn't just like the touchscreen isn't
 the thing it's the ability to constantly update

Speaker 1 :yeah


Speaker 0 :get better it gets better


Speaker 1 :i love my ios 14. uh


Speaker 0 :one thing that i probably disagree with
 you on on driving monitoring is you've said that it's easy like imean you you tend to say stuff is easy
 the uh i guess you said it's easy relative to theexternal perception problem
 can you elaborate why you think it's

Speaker 1 :easy feature engineering works
 for driver monitoring feature engineering does not work for theexternal


Speaker 0 :so human faces are not
 human faces and the movement of human faces and headand body is not as variable as the
 external environment

Speaker 1 :is your intuition um yes and there's
 another big difference as well um your reliability of a driver monitoringsystem
 doesn't actually need to be that high the uncertaintyif you have something that's detecting
 whether the human is paying attention it only works 92of the time you're still getting almost
 all the benefit of that because the human like you're training the humanyeah right you're you're dealing with a
 system that's really helping you out it's aconversation it's not
 like the external thing where guess what if you swerve into a tree you swerveinto a tree
 right like you get no margin for error

Speaker 0 :yeah i think that's really well put i
 i i think that's the right exactly the placewhere um where comparing to the external
 perception the control problem driver monitoring is easier because youknow the bar for success is much lower
 yeah but i i still think like the human faceis more complicated actually than the
 external environment but for driving you don't give a damn

Speaker 1 :i don't need you i don't need something
 i don't need something that complicated to to to have to communicate the ideato the human that i want to communicate
 which is yo system might mess up here you got to payattention


Speaker 0 :yeah see that's that's my love and
 fascination is the the human face and it feels like this isa nice place to um create products that
 create an experience in the car so like it feels like there should bemore richer experiences
 in the car you know like that's an opportunity forlike something like my eye or just any
 kind of system like a tesla or any of the autonomous vehicle companiesis because software's and there's much
 more sensors and so much is running on software andyou're doing machine learning anyway
 there's an opportunity to create totally new experiencesthat we're not even anticipating you
 don't think so no you think it's a box that gets youfrom a to b and you want to do it


Speaker 1 :chill yeah i mean i think as soon as we
 get to level three on highways okay enjoy your candy crushenjoy your hulu enjoy your
 you know whatever whatever sure you get this you can look at screens basicallyversus right now what do you have music


Speaker 0 :and audio books so level three is where
 you can kind of disengage in in stretches of time[Music]
 [Applause] well you think level three is possiblelike on the highway going for 100 miles
 and you can just go to sleep oh yeah

Speaker 1 :uh sleep so again
 i think it's really all on a spectrum i think thatbeing able to use your phone while
 you're on the highway and like this all being okay and beingaware that the car might alert you and
 you have five seconds to basically

Speaker 0 :so the five second thing that you think
 is possible yeah i think it is oh yeah

Speaker 1 :not not in all scenarios right some
 scenarios it's not

Speaker 0 :it's the whole risk thing that you
 mentioned is nice is to be able to estimate likehow risky is this situation exactly
 that's really important to understand one other thing you mentioned comparingcomma and
 autopilot is that um something about the haptic feel of theway combo controls the car
 when things are uncertain like it behaves a little bit more uncertain whenthings are uncertain
 that's kind of an interesting point and then autopilot is much more confidentalways even when it's uncertain until it
 runs into trouble yeah that's that's a funny thing iactually mentioned that to elon i think
 and then the first time we talked he wasn't bitingis like communicating uncertainty i
 guess comet doesn't really communicate uncertainty explicitly communicates itthrough haptic feel
 like what what's the role of communicating uncertainty do you think

Speaker 1 :oh we do some stuff explicitly like we
 do detect the lanes when you're on the highway and we'll show you how manylanes we're using to drive with
 you can look at where it thinks the lanes are you can look at umthe path and yeah we want to be better
 about this we're actually hiring i want to hire some new ui people ui

Speaker 0 :people you mentioned this because it's
 such an it's a ui problem too right it's we're

Speaker 1 :we have a great designer now
 but you know we need people who are just gonna like build this and debug theseuis
 qt people and okay is that what the ui

Speaker 0 :has done with this key


Speaker 1 :we're moving the new ui is in qt c plus


Speaker 0 :plus qt


Speaker 1 :uses it yeah we had some react stuff in
 there

Speaker 0 :react js would just react react is his
 own language right

Speaker 1 :react native reaction react to the
 javascript framework yeah it's all it's all based onjavascript but it's
 you know i like c plus plus

Speaker 0 :what do you think about uh dojo with
 tesla and their foray into what appears to bespecialized hardware for uh training
 neonets i guess it's something maybe you cancorrect me from my
 shallow looking at it it seems like something like google did with tpus butspecialized
 for uh driving data i don't think it's

Speaker 1 :specialized for driving data


Speaker 0 :it's just legit just tpu they want to
 inter go the apple way basically everything required in the chain is done

Speaker 1 :in-house well so you have a problem
 right now and this is one of my one of my concerns ireally would like to see
 somebody deal with this if anyone out there is doing it i'd like to help themif i can
 um you basically have two options right now to trainyour options are nvidia or google
 so google is not even an option their tpus are only available in googlecloud
 google has absolutely onerous terms of service restrictionsuh they may have changed it but back in
 google's terms of service it said explicitly you are not allowed to usegoogle cloud ml
 for training autonomous vehicles or for doing anything that competes with googlewithout google's prior written
 permission well okay i mean google is not aplatform company
 uh i wouldn't i wouldn't touch tpus with a 10-foot poleso that leaves you with the monopoly uh
 nvidia and video

Speaker 0 :so i mean that you're not a fan of well


Speaker 1 :look i was a huge fan of in 2016 nvidia
 jensen came sat in the car um cool guy when the stock was 30 a shareuh nvidia stock has skyrocketed i
 witnessed a real change in who was in management overthere in like 2018
 and now they are let's exploit let's take every dollar we possibly can out ofthis ecosystem
 let's charge ten thousand dollars for a100s because we know we got the best in the game
 and let's charge ten thousand dollars for an a100when it's really not that different from
 3080 which is 699. um the margins that they are making offof those high-end chips are
 so high that i mean i think they're shooting themselves in the foot justfrom a business perspective
 because there's a lot of people talking like me now who are like somebody's gottaken video down


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah where they could dominate it nvidia
 could be the new intel

Speaker 0 :yeah to be in inside everything
 essentially and and yet the winners in in certainspaces like
 autonomous driving the winners only the people who are likedesperately falling back and trying to
 catch up and have a ton of money like the big automakers are the onesinterested in partnering with nvidia


Speaker 1 :oh and then i think a lot of those
 things are going to fall through if i were nvidiasell chips sell chips at a reasonable
 markup

Speaker 0 :to everybody to everybody without any


Speaker 1 :restrictions without any restrictions
 intel did this look at intel they had a great long runnvidia is trying to turn their they're
 like trying to productize their chips way too much they're trying to extractway more value than they can sustainably
 sure you can do it tomorrow is it going to up your share price sure if you'reone of those ceos
 like how much can i strip mine this company and you know and that's what'sweird about it too
 like the ceo is the founder it's the same guy yeah i mean i still thinkjensen's a great guy that's great why do
 this you have a choice you have a choiceright now are you trying to cash out are
 you trying to buy a yacht if you are fine but if you're trying tobe
 the next huge semiconductor company sell chips

Speaker 0 :well the the interesting thing about
 jensen is he is a big vision guy so he hasa plan like for 50 years down the road
 so it makes me wonder like how does

Speaker 1 :price gouging fit into it yeah how does


Speaker 0 :that
 like it's it doesn't seem to make sense to plan

Speaker 1 :i worry that he's listening to the wrong


Speaker 0 :people yeah that that's the sense i have
 too sometimes because i despite everythingi think nvidia is an incredible company
 well one sort of i'm deeply grateful to nvidiafor the products they've created me to
 pass right

Speaker 1 :and so the 1080 ti was a great gpu still
 have a lot of them

Speaker 0 :it was yeah but
 at the same time it just feels like feels like you don't want to put allyour stock in nvidia and so like elon
 is doing um what tesla is doing with autopilot and dojois the apple way is because they're not
 going to share dojo with uh george hotz uh

Speaker 1 :i i know they should sell that chip
 oh they should sell their even their their accelerator the accelerator that'sin all the cars the 30 watt one


Speaker 0 :sell it why not so open it up
 make me why does this have to be a car company

Speaker 1 :well if you sell the chip here's what
 you get yeah make some money off the chips it doesn'ttake away from your chip
 you're going to make some money free money and alsothe world is going to build an ecosystem
 of tooling for you right you're not going to have to fixthe bug in your tanh layer
 someone else already did well the

Speaker 0 :question that's an interesting question
 i mean that's the question steve jobs asked that's thequestion elon musk is
 uh perhaps asking is uh do you want tesla stuff inside othervehicles in
 inside potentially inside like uh irobot vacuum cleaner

Speaker 1 :yeah i think you should decide where
 your advantages are i'm not saying tesla should startselling battery packs to automakers
 because battery packs to automakers they are straight up in competition with youif i were tesla i'd keep the battery
 technology totally yeah ssr's we make batteriesbut the thing about the tesla tpu um
 is anybody can build that it's just a question of you knoware you willing to spend the you know


Speaker 0 :the money it could be a huge source of
 revenue potentially

Speaker 1 :are you willing to spend 100 million
 dollars right anyone can build it and someone will and a bunch ofcompanies now are starting trying to
 build ai accelerators somebody's going to get the idea rightand yeah hopefully they don't get greedy
 because they'll just lose to the next guy who finally and then eventually thechinese are going to make knock off and
 video chips and that's

Speaker 0 :from your perspective i don't know if
 you're also paying attention to stan tesla for a momentall dave elon musk has talked about a
 complete rewrite of uh the neural net that they're usingthat seems to
 again i'm half paying attention but it seems to involvebasically a kind of integration of all
 the sensors to where it's a four dimensional view you knowyou have a 3d
 model of the world over time and then you can i think it's doneboth for the for actually you know
 so the neural network is able to in a more holistic way deal with the worldand make predictions and so on
 but also to make the annotation task more uhyou know easier like you can annotate
 the world in one place and then kind of distributeitself across the sensors and
 across a different like the hundreds of tasks that are involvedin the hydronet what are your thoughts
 about this rewrite is it just like some detailsthat are kind of obvious there are steps
 that should be taken or is there something fundamentalthat could challenge your idea that end
 to end is the right solution

Speaker 1 :uh we're in the middle of a bakery right
 now as well we haven't shipped a new model in a bitof what kind uh we're going from 2d to
 3d right now all our stuff like for examplewhen the car pitches back the lane lines
 also pitch back uh because we're assuming the flat roflat world hypothesis
 uh the new models do not do this the new models output everything in 3d

Speaker 0 :um so this but there's still no
 annotation so the 3d is it's more about the opposite yeah uh

Speaker 1 :we have we have disease and everything
 uh we've disease

Speaker 0 :yeah we had a disease we had a disease


Speaker 1 :um we unified
 a lot of stuff as well uh we switched from tensorflow to pi torchyes uh my understanding
 of what tesla's thing is is that their annotator now annotates across the timedimension
 uh i mean cute why are you building an annotator i i

Speaker 0 :find their entire pipeline
 i find your vision i mean the vision event to endvery compelling but i also like the
 engineering of the data engine that they've createdin terms of supervised learning
 pipelines that thing is damn impressive you'rebasically the
 the idea is that you have hundreds of thousands of people that are doing datacollection for you by doing their
 experience so that's kind of similar to the common ai modeland you're able to
 mine that data based on the kind of edge cases you needi i think it's harder to do in the end
 to end learning the mining of the right edge cases likethat's where feature engineering
 is actually really powerful because like us humans are able to do this kindof mining a little better but but
 yeah there's obvious as we as we know there's obvious constraints andlimitations to that


Speaker 1 :idea uh carpathi just tweeted he's like
 um you get really interesting insights ifyou saw if you sort your validation set
 by loss and look at the highest loss examplesyeah
 uh so yeah i mean you can do we we have we have a little data engine like thingwe're training a segment uh
 it's not fancy it's just like okay train the new segmentrun it on 100 000 images and now take
 the thousand with highest loss select 100 of those by human put thoseget those ones labeled
 retrain do it again right so it's a much less well-written data engine and yeahyou can you can take these things really
 far and it is impressive engineering and if you trulyneed supervised data for a problem
 yeah things like data engine are the high end of thewhat is attention is a human paying
 attention i mean we're going to probably build something that looks like dataengine to push our driver monitoring
 further um but for driving itself you have itall annotated beautifully
 by what the human does so yeah that's

Speaker 0 :interesting i mean that applies to
 driver attention as well do you want to detectthe eyes do you want to detect blinking
 and pupil movement do you want to detect all the like facealignments the landmark detection and so
 on and then doing kind of reasoning basedon that or do you want to take the
 entirety of the face over time and do and i mean it's obvious that overeventually you have to do end to end
 with some calibration with some fixes and so onbut it's uh like i don't know when
 that's the right move

Speaker 1 :even if it's end to end there actually
 is there is no kind of um you have to supervise thatwith humans
 whether a human is paying attention or not is a completely subjective judgmentum like you can try to like
 automatically do it with some stuff but you don'thave if i record a video of a human i
 don't have true annotations anywhere in that videothe only way to get them
 is with you know other humans labeling it really

Speaker 0 :well i don't know uh you you so
 if you think deeply about it you could you might be able to just depending onthe task maybe you'll discover
 self-annotating things like you know you can look at like steeringwheel reversal or something like that
 you can discover little moments of lapse of attention yeahi mean that's that's where psychology
 comes in is there indicate because you have so somuch data to look at
 so you might be able to find moments when there's like justinattention that even with smartphone if
 you want to detect smartphone use yeah you can start to zoom in i meanthat's the gold mine
 sort of the comma ai i mean tesla's doing this too right is there they'redoing
 annotation based on it's like uh self-supervisedlearning too it's just a small part of
 the entire picture it's that's kind of the challengeof solving a problem in machine learning
 if you can discover self-annotating parts of the problem

Speaker 1 :right our driver monitoring team is half
 a person right now i have a problem you know once we have skill to full once

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :we have two people once we have two
 three people on that team i definitely want to look atself-annotating stuff or yeah for
 attention

Speaker 0 :let's go back for a sec to uh to a comma
 and how what you know for people who are curious to try it outhow do you install a comma in say a 2020
 toyota corolla or like what are the cars that aresupported what are the cars that you
 recommend and what does it take you have a fewvideos out but maybe through words can
 you explain what's it take to actually install a

Speaker 1 :thing so we support uh i think it's 91
 cars 91 makes models um we get to 100 thisyear


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :nice the yeah the
 2020 corolla great choice the um 2020 sonata uh it's using thestock longitudinal it's using just our
 lateral control but it's a very refined car theirlongitudinal control is not
 bad at all um so yeah corolla sonata or if you're willing to get yourhands a little dirty and look in the
 right places on the internet the honda civic is greatuh but you're going to have to install a
 modified eps firmware in order to get a little bit more torqueand i can't help you with that comma
 does not officially endorse that um but we have been doing it we didn'tever release it
 uh we waited for someone else to discover it and then you know

Speaker 0 :and you have a discord server where
 people there's a very active developer community yeah as opposed toso
 depending on the level of experimentation you're willing toto do that's the community if you


Speaker 1 :if you just want to buy it and you have
 a supported car yeah it's 10 minutes to install there's youtubevideos it's
 ikea furniture level if you can set up a table from ikeayou can install a comma 2 in your
 supported car and it will just work now you're like oh but i want thishigh-end feature or i want to fix this
 bug okay well welcome to the developer

Speaker 0 :community uh
 so what if i wanted to this is something i asked you offlineor like a few months ago if i wanted to
 run my own code to um so use comma as aplatform and try to run something like
 open pilot what does it take to do that um so

Speaker 1 :there's a toggle in the settings called
 enable ssh and if you toggle that you can ssh intoyour device you can modify the code you
 can upload whatever code you want to it um there's a whole lot of people soabout 60 of people are running stock
 comma about 40 percent of people are runningforks and there's a community
 of there's a bunch of people who maintain these forks and these forkssupport
 different cars or they have you know uh different toggleswe try to keep away from the toggles
 that are like disabled driver monitoring butyou know there's some people might want
 that kind of thing and like you know yeah you can it's your car it's youri'm not here to tell you you know
 uh we we have some you know we ban if you're trying to subvert safetyfeatures you're banned from our discord
 i don't want anything to do with you but there's some forks doing that you

Speaker 0 :got it
 so you encourage responsible uh forking

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah some people you know yeah some
 people uh like like there's forks that will doum some people just like having a lot of
 uh readouts on the ui like a lot of like flashing numbers so there's forks thatdo that
 uh some people don't like the fact that it disengages when you press the gaspedal there's forks that disable that


Speaker 0 :got it now the the stock experience is
 is what like so it does both lane keeping andlongitudinal control
 all together so it's not separate like it is an autopilot

Speaker 1 :no so okay um some cars we use the stock
 longitudinal control we don't do the longitudinal control on all the carsuh some cars the acc's are pretty good
 in the cars it's the lane keep that's atrocious in anything except forautopilot super cruise


Speaker 0 :but you know you just turn it on and it
 it works what does this engagement look

Speaker 1 :like yeah so we have i mean i'm very
 concerned about mode confusion i've experienced it on supercruise andand autopilot where
 like autopilot like autopilot disengages i don't realize that the acc is still onthe lead car moves slightly over and
 then the tesla accelerates to like whatever my set speed is super fast andlike
 what's going on here um we have engaged and disengaged and this issimilar to my understanding i'm not a
 pilot but my understanding is either the pilotis in control or the co-pilot is in
 control and we have the same kind of transitionsystem either open pilot is engaged or
 open pilot is disengaged engage with cruise control disengagewith either gas break or cancel


Speaker 0 :let's talk about money what's uh the
 business strategy for comma profitable well it's you're goodso congratulations yeah uh what uh
 so basically selling so we should say combo cost uh

Speaker 1 :a thousand bucks comment 200 for the
 interface to the car as well it's 1200 all said done

Speaker 0 :nobody's usually up front like this yeah


Speaker 1 :you got it you got to have the tac


Speaker 0 :on right yeah i love it this side i'm


Speaker 1 :not going to lie to you
 trust me it will add 1200 value to your life yes

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :it's still super cheap 30 days no
 questions asked money back guarantee and prices are only going up you know ifthere ever is future hardware
 it could cost a lot more than twelve

Speaker 0 :hundred dollars so comma three is in the
 works

Speaker 1 :so it could be all i will say is future
 hardware is going to cost a lot more than the current hardware

Speaker 0 :yeah like i mean the people that use uh
 the people i've spoken with that use commause open pilot they first of all they
 use it a lot so people that use it they they fall in

Speaker 1 :love with oh our retention rate is
 insane

Speaker 0 :this is a good sign yeah it's a really
 good sign um

Speaker 1 :70 of comma 2 buyers are daily active
 users

Speaker 0 :yeah it's amazing


Speaker 1 :um oh also we don't plan on stopping
 selling the comma too like like it's you know so whatever you

Speaker 0 :create that's beyond comma two
 it would be uh it would be potentially a phase shiftlike it's you it's so much better that
 like you could use comma two and you can usecomma depends what you want it's three
 point four one kind of 42

Speaker 1 :yeah you know autopilot hardware one
 versus hardware two yeah the comma two is kind of like hardware one got it gotit


Speaker 0 :got it got it i think i heard you talk
 about retention rate with the vr headsets that the average is justonce yeah which is fast i mean it's such
 a fascinating way to think about technologyand this is a really really good sign
 and the other thing that people say about comm is like they can't believethey're getting this for a thousand
 bucks right it's it seems it seems like a somekind of steal
 so but in terms of like long-term business strategies it basically toput so it's currently in like a thousand
 plus cars

Speaker 1 :1200 more uh
 so yeah dailies is about uh dailies is about 2 000 weekly is about 2500. monthlies is over 3 000.
 wow we've grown a lot since we've stopped

Speaker 0 :is the goal like can we talk crazy for a
 second i mean what's the goal to overtake tesla let's talkokay so i mean android did overtake ios
 yeah that's exactly it right so yeah they did it i actually don't knowthe timeline of that one
 they but let let's talk uh because everything is in alpha now theautopilot you could argue is in alpha in
 terms of towards the big mission of autonomousdriving right and so
 what yes your goal to overtake into millions of carsessentially of course where would it


Speaker 1 :stop
 like it's open source software it might not be millions of cars with a piece ofcomma hardware but yeah
 i think open pilot at some point will cross over autopilot in in usersjust like android crossed over ios


Speaker 0 :how does google make money from android
 uh it's it's complicated their own devices make money

Speaker 1 :google google makes money by just kind
 of having you on the internet uh yes google search is built in gmailis built in
 android is just a shill for the rest of

Speaker 0 :google's ecosystem yeah but the problem
 is android is not is a brilliant thing imean
 android arguably changed the world so there you go that'syou can you can feel good ethically
 speaking but as a business strategy it's questionable i'll sell hardware so

Speaker 1 :hardware i mean it took google a long
 time to come around to it but they are now making money on the pixel

Speaker 0 :you're not about money you're more about


Speaker 1 :winning yeah of course
 but if only if only 10 percent of open pilot devicescome from comma ai we still make a lot
 that is still yes that is a ton of money

Speaker 0 :for our company but can't somebody
 create a better comma using open pilot oryou're basically saying well i'll
 compete well i'll compete

Speaker 1 :is can you create a better android phone
 than the google pixel right i mean you can but like i love that so

Speaker 0 :you're confident
 like you know what the hell you're doing yeah it'sit's uh confidence in merit i mean our


Speaker 1 :money yeah our money comes from we're a
 consumer electronics company yeah and put it this way so we sold wesold like three thousand company's
 um i'm 2500 right now uh and likeokay we're probably going to sell 10 000
 units next year right 10 000 units even just a thousand dollars a unit okaywe're 10 million in uh
 in in in in revenue um get that up to a hundred thousandmaybe double the price of the unit now
 we're talking like 200 million in revenue yeah

Speaker 0 :actually making money uh one of the rare
 semi-autonomous or autonomous vehicle companies that are actually makingmoney yeah yeah you know


Speaker 1 :if you have if you look at a model when
 we were just talking about this yesterday if you look at a modeland like you're testing like you're a b
 testing your model and if you're you're you'reone branch of the a b test the losses go
 down very fast in the first five epochs yeahthat model is probably going to converge
 to something considerably better than the one where the losses are going downslower
 why do people think this is going to stop why do people think one day there'sgoing to be a great like
 well waymo's eventually going to surpass you guys

Speaker 0 :no they're not you see like a world
 where like a tesla or a car like a tesla would beable to
 basically press a button and you like switch to open pilotyou know you know they load in i don't


Speaker 1 :know so
 i think so first off i think that we may surpass teslain terms of users uh i do not think
 we're gonna surpass tesla ever in terms of revenuei think tesla can capture a lot more
 revenue per user than we can um but this mimics the android ios modelexactly
 there may be more android devices but you know there's a lot more iphones thangoogle pixels
 so i think there'll be a lot more tesla cars sold than pieces of comma hardwareum and then as far as a
 tesla owner being able to switch to open pilotuh does ios does iphones run android


Speaker 0 :no but you can if you really want to do


Speaker 1 :it but it doesn't really make sense like
 it's not

Speaker 0 :it doesn't make sense who cares what
 about if uh a large company like automakers 4g m toyota came to georgehotz or
 on the tech space amazon facebook google came with a large pile of cashwould would you consider being
 purchased do you see that as a one possible not

Speaker 1 :seriously now
 um i would probably uh see how much uh they'll entertainfor me
 um and if they're willing to like jump through a bunch of my hoops then maybebut like no not the way that m a works
 today i mean we've been approached and i laugh in these people's faces i'mlike are you kidding me


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah you know because you're so it's so
 it's so demeaning the m a people are so demeaning to companies they treat thestartup world
 as their innovation ecosystem and they think that i'm cool with going alongwith that
 so i can have some of their scam fake fed dollars you know fedcoin i don'twhat am i gonna do with more fedcoin you
 know i had coin fat coin man

Speaker 0 :i love that so that's the cool thing
 about podcasting actually is uh people criticize i don't know if you'refamiliar with the spotify
 uh giving joe rogan a hundred million

Speaker 1 :and something about that


Speaker 0 :and you know they respect
 despite all the that people are talking about spotifypeople understand that podcasters like
 joe rogan know what the hell they're doing yeah sothey give them money
 and say just do what you do and like the equivalent for you would belike
 george do what the hell you do because you're good at it try not to murder toomany people
 like try like there's some kind of common sense things likejust don't go on a weird rampage of


Speaker 1 :yeah it comes down to what companies i
 could respect right um you know could i respect gmnever
 um no i couldn't i mean could i respect likea hyundai more so right that's that's a
 lot closer toyota what's your nah nah it's korean is theway
 i think i think that you know the japanese the germans the us they're alltoo
 they're all too you know they all think

Speaker 0 :they're too great what about the tech
 companies

Speaker 1 :apple apple is of the tech companies
 that i could respect apple's the closest yeah i mean i could never subscribe it

Speaker 0 :would be ironic
 oh if uh if common ai is acquired by apple

Speaker 1 :i mean facebook look i quit facebook 10
 years ago because i didn't respect the business modelum google has declined so fast in the
 last five years

Speaker 0 :what are your thoughts about waymo as
 present and future so let me let me see let me start by saying something uh nicewhich is uh
 i've visited them a few times and i've [Music]have ridden in their cars and
 the engineering that they're doing both the research and the actualdevelopment and the engineering they're
 doing and the scale they're actually achievingby doing it all themselves
 is really impressive and the the balance of safety and innovationand like the cars work
 really well for the routes they drive like they drivefast which was very surprising to me
 like it drives like the speed limit or faster the speedlimit it goes
 and it works really damn well and the interface is nice and chandler arizonayeah yeah yeah in challengers in a very
 specific environment so it i you know it gives me enoughmaterial
 in my mind to push back against the madman of the world likegeorge hotz to be like
 like because you kind of imply there's zero probability they're going to win

Speaker 1 :yeah and and after i've used


Speaker 0 :after i've written in it to me it's not


Speaker 1 :zero oh it's not for technology reasons
 bureaucracy no it's worse than that it's actually for product reasons i think

Speaker 0 :oh you think they're just not capable of
 creating an amazing product uh

Speaker 1 :no i think that the product that they're
 building doesn't make sense um so a few things uh you say the weimosare fast
 um benchmark away mo against a competent uber driverright right the uber driver is faster


Speaker 0 :it's not even about speed it's the thing
 you said it's about the experience of being stuckat a stop sign
 because pedestrians are crossing non-stop

Speaker 1 :i like when my uber driver doesn't come
 to a full stop at the stop sign yeah you know and solet's say the waymo's are 20 slower than
 than an uber right um you can argue they're going tobe cheaper
 and i argue that users already have the choice to trade off money for speedit's called uberpool um i think it's
 like 15 of rides or uber pools right users arenot willing to trade off
 money for speed so the whole product that they're buildingis not going to be competitive with
 traditional ride sharing networks right um like and alsowhether there's profit to be made
 depends entirely on one company having a monopolyi think that the level for autonomous
 ride sharing vehicles market is going to look a lot like thescooter market if even the technology
 does come to exist which i question who's doing well in that market yeahit's a race to the bottom


Speaker 0 :you know well they could be it could be
 closer like an uber and a lyft where it's just a one or two playerswell


Speaker 1 :the scooter people have given up trying
 to market scooters as a practical means of transportationand they're just like
 they're super fun to ride look at wheels i love those things and they're great onthat front
 yeah but from an actual transportation product perspectivei do not think scooters are viable and i
 do not think level 4 autonomous cars are viable

Speaker 0 :if you uh let's play a fun experiment if
 you ran let's do a tesla and let's do waymoif uh elon musk took a vacation for
 a year he just said screw it i'm gonna go live on an islandno electronics and the board decides
 that we need to find somebody to run the companyand they they decide that you should run
 the company for a year how do you run tesla differently i

Speaker 1 :wouldn't change much


Speaker 0 :do you think they're on the right track


Speaker 1 :i wouldn't change i mean i'd have some
 minor changes but even even my debate with teslaabout you know end to end versus segnets
 like that's just software who cares rightlike it's not gonna it's not like you're
 doing something terrible with segnats you're probably building somethingthat's at least going to help you debug
 the end-to-end system a lot right it's very easy to transition fromwhat they have
 to like an end-to-end kind of thing

Speaker 0 :and then i presume you would uh
 in the model y or maybe in the model 3 start adding driver sensing with

Speaker 1 :infrared yes i would add i would
 i would add infrared camera infrared lightsright away to those cars um


Speaker 0 :and start collecting that data and do
 all that kind of stuff yeah

Speaker 1 :very much i think they're already kind
 of doing it it's it's an incredibly minor changeif i actually were ceo of tesla first
 off i'd be horrified that i wouldn't be able to do a good job as elonand then i would try to you know
 understand the way he's done things

Speaker 0 :before he would also have to take over
 his twitter so god i don't tweet yeah what's yourtwitter situation why
 why why are you so quiet on twitter comma islike what what's your social network
 presence like because you you on instagram you're you're you uh you dolive streams you're
 you're you're um you understand the music of the internetbut you don't always fully engage into
 it you're part-time i used to have a

Speaker 1 :twitter
 yeah i mean it's the pr instagram is a pretty placeinstagram is a beautiful place it
 glorifies beauty i like i like instagram's values as a networkum twitter glorifies conflict glorifies
 you know like like like like like you know justshots
 taking shots at people and it's like you know wellyou know twitter and donald trump are


Speaker 0 :perfectly
 they're perfect for each other so tesla's on uh tesla's on the right trackin your view yeah
 okay so let's try let's like really try this experiment if you ranway more let's say they're i don't know
 if you agree but they seem to be at the head of the packof the kind of
 uh what would you call that approach like it's not necessarily lighter basedbecause it's not about lighter but
 before robot taxi level four robot taxi all in before anybefore making your revenue
 uh so they're probably at the head of the pack if you weresaid hey george can you please run this
 company for a year how would you

Speaker 1 :change it uh i would go i would get
 anthony levandowski out of jail and i would put him in charge of the

Speaker 0 :company
 um let's try to break that apart why do you do you want to make do youwant to destroy the company by doing
 that or do you mean or do you mean uh you likerenegade style thinking that uh pushes
 that that like throws away bureaucracy and goes to first principle thinkingwhat
 what do you mean by that um i think

Speaker 1 :anthony lewandowski is a genius
 and i think he would come up with a much better idea of what to do with waymothan me


Speaker 0 :so you mean that unironically he is a
 genius oh yes oh absolutely

Speaker 1 :without a doubt i mean i'm not saying
 there's no shortcomings but in the interactions i've had withhim yeah
 what um he's also willing to take like who knows what he would do with waymoi mean he's also out there like far more
 out there than i am yeah there's big

Speaker 0 :risks
 yeah what do you make of him i was i was going to talk to him in this podcast andi was going back and forth
 i'm i'm such a gullible naive human like i see the best in peopleand i slowly started to realize that
 there might be some people out there that like have multiple faces to theworld
 they're like deceiving and dishonest i stillrefuse to like i i just i trust people
 and i don't care if i get hurt by it but likeyou know sometimes you have to be a
 little bit careful especially platform wise andpodcast wise what do you what am i
 supposed to think so you think you think he's a goodperson


Speaker 1 :oh i don't know i don't really make
 moral judgments

Speaker 0 :and it's difficult to oh oh i mean this


Speaker 1 :about the waymo actually i mean that
 whole idea very non-ironically about what i would dothe problem with putting me in charge of
 waymo is waymo is already 10 billion dollars in the hull rightwhatever idea waymo does look
 com is profitable comes raised 8.1 million dollars that's smallyou know that's small money like i can
 build a reasonable consumer electronics companyand succeed wildly at that and still
 never be able to pay back weight most 10 billion

Speaker 0 :so i i think the basic idea with women
 well forget the 10 billion because they have some backing butyour basic thing is like what can we do
 to stop making some money

Speaker 1 :well no i mean my bigger idea is like
 whatever the idea is that's going to save waymoi don't have it it's going to have to be
 a big risk idea and i cannot think of a better person than anthony lewandowskito do it
 so that is completely what i would do as ceo of waymo i call myself atransitionary ceo
 do everything i can to fix that situation yeah

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :uh yeah cause i can't i can't do it
 right like i can't i can't oh i mean i can talk about how what ireally want to do is just apologize for
 all those corny uh you know ad campaigns and be likehere's the real state of the technology


Speaker 0 :yeah um like i have several criticism
 i'm a little bit more bullish on waymo than than you seem to be butone criticism i have is it went into
 corny mode too early like it's still a startup it hasn'tdelivered on anything so
 it should be like more renegade and show off the engineering that they're doingwhich just can be impressive as opposed
 to doing these weird commercials of like your friendly yeah your friendly carcompany


Speaker 1 :i mean that's my biggest my biggest
 snipe at waymo was always that guy's a paid actorthat guy's not a waymo user he's a paid
 actor look here i found his call sheet

Speaker 0 :do kind of like what spacex is doing
 with uh the rocket launchers just get put the nerds up front put theengineers up front and just like
 show failures too just i love i love

Speaker 1 :spacex's


Speaker 0 :yeah yeah the thing they're doing is
 right and it just feels like the right but we're all so

Speaker 1 :excited to see them succeed
 yeah i can't wait to see when it won't fail you know like you lie to me i wantyou to fail
 you tell me the truth you'll be honest with me i want you to succeed yeah

Speaker 0 :uh yeah and that requires the uh the
 renegade ceo right i'm with you i'm with you i stillhave a little bit of faith in waymo to
 for for the renegade ceo to step forward but

Speaker 1 :it's not it's not john krafter yeah


Speaker 0 :it's uh you can't it's not chris


Speaker 1 :holmstone
 and those people may be very good at certain things yeahbut they're not renegades because these


Speaker 0 :companies are fundamentally even though
 we're talking about billion dollars all these crazy numbers they're stilllike early stage startups


Speaker 1 :i mean i i just i if you are pre-revenue
 and you've raised 10 billion dollars i have no idea likelike this just doesn't work no it's
 against everything silicon valley where's your minimum viable productyou know where's your users what's your
 growth numbers this is traditional silicon valley whydo you not apply it to what you think
 you're too big to fail already

Speaker 0 :like how do you think autonomous
 driving will change society so the mission isfor comma to uh solve
 self-driving do you have like a vision of the world of howit'll be different
 is it as simple as a to b transportation or is there likebecause these are robots it's not about


Speaker 1 :autonomous driving in and of itself it's
 what the technology enables it's i think it's the coolest applied aiproblem i like it because it has a clear
 path to monetary value um but as far as that being the thing thatchanges the world
 i mean no like like there's cute things we're doing in common like who thoughtyou could stick a
 phone on the windshield middle drive um but like really the product that you'rebuilding is not
 something that people were not capable of imagining 50 years agoso no it doesn't change the world in
 that front could people imagine the internet 50 years ago only truejunior genius visionaries yeah everyone
 could have imagined autonomous cars 50 years agoit's like a core but i don't drive it


Speaker 0 :see i i have this sense
 and i told you like i'm my long-term dreamis robots with which you have deep
 with whom you have deep connections rightand there's different trajectories
 towards that and i've been thinking so i've beenthinking of launching a startup
 i see autonomous vehicles as a potential trajectory to that thati'm that's not where the direction i
 would like to go but i also see tesla or even kamehameha likepivoting into
 into robotics broadly defined that's at some stage in the way likeyou're mentioning the internet didn't
 expect

Speaker 1 :let's solve you know when i say a comma
 about this we could talk about this but let's solve self-driving cars firstgot to stay focused on the mission don't
 don't don't you're not too big to fail for however much i think kama's winninglike no no
 no you're winning when you solve level five self-driving cars and until thenyou haven't win and
 one and you know again you want to be arrogant in the face of other peoplegreat you want to be arrogant in the
 face of nature you're an idiot right

Speaker 0 :stay mission focused brilliantly put uh
 like i mentioned thinking of launching a startup i'vebeen considering actually before
 cove i've been thinking of moving to san francisco oh

Speaker 1 :oh i wouldn't go there so why is uh


Speaker 0 :okay well and now i'm thinking about
 potentially austin um and we're in san diego now san diegocome here
 so why what um i mean you're such an interesting humanyou've launched so many successful
 things what uh why san diego what do yourecommend why not san francisco
 have you thought so for in your case san diego with qualcomm and snapdragon imean
 that's an amazing combination but that wasn't really why

Speaker 1 :that wasn't the why no i mean qualcomm
 was an afterthought qualcomm was it was a nice thing to think about it's likeyou can have
 a tech company here and a good one i mean you know i like qualcomm but

Speaker 0 :no um what's the west san diego better
 than stephanie why does san francisco suck

Speaker 1 :well so okay so first off we all kind of
 said like we want to stay in california people like the ocean you knowcalifornia
 for for its flaws it's like a lot of the flaws of california are not necessarilycalifornia as a whole and they're much
 more san francisco specific yeah um san francisco so i think firstyear cities in general
 have stopped wanting growth uh well you have like in san francisco youknow the voting class always votes to
 not build more houses because they own all the houses and they're like wellyou know once people have figured out
 how to vote themselves more money they're going to do itit is so insanely corrupt um it is not
 balanced at all like political party-wise you know it'sit's a one-party city and


Speaker 0 :for all the discussion of diversity it's
 has it's stops lacking real diversity of thought of background of uhapproaches to strategies of yeah ideas
 it's it's kind of a strange place that it's the loudestpeople about diversity and the biggest
 lack of diversity

Speaker 1 :well i mean that's that's what they say
 right it's the projection

Speaker 0 :projection yeah yeah it's interesting
 and even people in silicon valley tell me that's uhlike high up people but everybody is
 like this is a terrible place it doesn't

Speaker 1 :make i mean and coronavirus is really
 what killed it yeah san francisco was the number one uhexodus


Speaker 0 :during coronavirus we still think san
 diego is a good place to be

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah i mean we'll see
 we'll see what happens with california a bit longer term yeah i like austriansand austin's an interesting choice i
 wouldn't i wouldn't i don't have really anything bad to say about austineither except for the extreme heat in
 the summer um which you know but that's like very on the surface right i thinkas far as like an ecosystem
 goes it's it's cool i personally love coloradocolorado uh yeah i mean you have these
 states that are you know like just way better runum california is you know it's
 especially san francisco so it's high horse and like

Speaker 0 :yeah can i ask you for advice
 to me and to others about what's it take to build a successful

Speaker 1 :startup oh i don't know i haven't done
 that talk to someone who did that well you

Speaker 0 :know
 uh this is like another book of years that i'll buy for 67i suppose uh so there's um


Speaker 1 :one of these days will sell out yeah
 that's right jail breaks are going to be a dollar and books are going to be 67.

Speaker 0 :how i uh how i joe broke the iphone by
 george cotts that's right

Speaker 1 :how i jailbroke the iphone and you can


Speaker 0 :do it
 that's right that's right oh god okay i can't wait butquite so you haven't introspected you
 have built a very unique company i meannot not you but you and others
 but i don't know um there's no there's nothing you have an interest butyou haven't really sat down and thought
 about like well like if you and i we're having abunch of we're having some beers
 and you're seeing that i'm depressed and whatever i'm strugglingthere's no advice you can give oh i mean


Speaker 1 :more beer more beer
 yeah i think it's all very like situation dependentum here's okay if i can give a generic
 piece of advice it's the technology always wins thebetter technology
 always wins and lying always loses build technologyand don't lie i'm with you i agree very


Speaker 0 :much
 the long run long run sure it's the long

Speaker 1 :run you know what the market can remain
 irrational longer than you can remain solventtrue fact well this is this is an


Speaker 0 :interesting point because i
 ethically and just as a human believe that umlike sm like hype and smoke and mirrors
 is not at any stage of the company is a good strategyi mean there's some like you know pr
 magic kind of like you know you want a new product yeah if

Speaker 1 :there's a call to action
 if there's like a call to action like buy my new gpu look at it it takes upthree slots and it's this big it's huge
 buy my g for you yeah

Speaker 0 :that's great if you look at you know
 especially in that in the ai space broadly but autonomous vehicleslike you can raise a huge amount of
 money on nothing and the question to me is like i'magainst that i'll never be
 part of that i don't think i hope not willingly not but like is theresomething to be said
 to uh essentially lying to raise money like fake it till you make it kindof thing


Speaker 1 :i mean this is billy mcfarland the fire
 festival like we all we all experienced uh you know what happenswith that no
 no don't fake it till you make it be honestand hope you make it the whole way the


Speaker 0 :technology wins


Speaker 1 :right the technology wins and like there
 is i'm not i use like the anti-hype you know that'sthat's a slava kpss reference but
 um hype isn't necessarily bad i loved camping out for the iphonesum you know and as long as the hype is
 backed by like substance as long as it's backed bysomething i can actually
 buy and like it's real then hype is great and it's a greatfeeling it's when the hype is backed by
 lies that it's a bad feeling

Speaker 0 :i mean a lot of people call elon musk a
 fraud how could he be a fraud i've noticed this this kind ofinteresting effect which is
 he does tend to over promise and deliver what's what's the better wayto phrase it
 promise a timeline that he doesn't deliver on he delivers muchlater on what do you think about that
 because i do that i think that's a programmer thingyeah i do that as well you think that's
 a really bad thing to do or is that okay i think that's again as

Speaker 1 :long as like
 you're working toward it and you're gonna deliver on itit's not too far off right
 right like like you know the whole the wholeautonomous vehicle thing it's like i
 mean i still think tesla's on track to beat us i stillthink even with their even with their
 missteps they have advantages we don't have umyou know illness is better than me at
 at like marshaling massive amounts of resourcesso you know i still think given the fact
 they're maybe making some wrong decisionsthey'll end up winning and like
 it's fine to hype it if you're actually gonna winright if elon says look we're gonna be
 landing rockets back on earth in a year and it takes fourlike you know he landed a rocket back on
 earth and he was working toward it the wholetime i think there's some amount of like
 i think when it becomes wrong is if you know you're not gonna meet that deadlineif you're lying yeah that's brilliantly


Speaker 0 :put like
 this is what people don't understand i thinklike elon believes everything he says he
 does

Speaker 1 :as far as i can tell he does and i i


Speaker 0 :detected that
 in myself too like if i it's only  ifyou're like conscious of yourself lying
 yeah i think so yeah you know you can't

Speaker 1 :take that to such an extreme
 right like in a way i think maybe billy mcfarland believed everything he saidtoo


Speaker 0 :right that's how you started cult and
 everybody uh kills themselves

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah like it's you need you need if
 there's like some factor on it it's fine and you need somepeople to like
 you know keep you in check but like if you deliver on most of the things yousay and just the timelines are off


Speaker 0 :yeah it does piss people off though i
 wonder but who cares in the long arc of historythe people
 everybody gets pissed off at the people who succeed which isone of the things that frustrates me
 about this world is uh they don't celebratethe success of others like
 there's so many people that want elon to failit's so fascinating to me like what
 is wrong with you like so elon musk talks about like people shortlike they talk about financial
 yeah but i think it's much bigger than the financials i've seen like the humanfactors community they
 want they want other people to fail why why why like even people theharshest thing is like
 you know even people that like seem to really hate donald trumpthey want him to fail yeah or like the
 other president or they want barack obama to fail it's like

Speaker 1 :we're almost involved it's weird but i


Speaker 0 :i want that i would love to inspire that
 part of the world to change because well damn it if the humanspecies is going to survive we should
 celebrate success like it seems like the efficient thingto do in this objective function that
 like we're all striving for is to celebrate the ones that likefigure out how to like do better
 at that objective function as opposed to like dragging them downback into them into the mud i think


Speaker 1 :there is
 this is the speech i always give about the commenters on hacker newsum so first off something to remember
 about the internet in general is commenters are not representative ofthe population
 yeah i don't comment on anything i don't you knowcommenters are are representative of a
 certain sliver of the population and on hacker news a common thing i'llsay is when you'll see something that's
 like you know promises to be wild out thereand
 in innovative there is some amount of you know checking them back to earth butthere's also some amount of
 if this thing succeeds well i'm 36 and i've worked at large techcompanies my whole life
 they can't succeed because if they succeed that would mean that i couldhave done something different with my
 life but we know that i couldn't have we knowthat i couldn't have and and that's why
 they're going to fail and they have to root for them to failto kind of maintain their world image


Speaker 0 :so tune it out and they comment well
 it's hard i uh so one of the things one of the things i'm consideringstartup wise is to change that
 because i think the i think it's also a technology problem it's a platformproblem i agree it's like
 because the thing you said most people don't commenti think most people want to comment
 they just don't because it's all the  for commenting exactly i don't

Speaker 1 :want to be grouped in with that or not


Speaker 0 :you don't want to be in a at a party
 where everyone is an yeah so they but that's a platformproblem that's


Speaker 1 :i can't believe what reddit's become i
 can't believe the group think in reddit comments

Speaker 0 :there's a red is an interesting one
 because they're subreddits and so you can still see especiallysmall subreddits
 that like that are little like havens of likejoy and positivity and like deep
 even disagreement but like nuanced discussion but it's only like smalllittle pockets
 but that's uh that's emergent the platform's not helping that orhurting that so i guess naturally
 something about the internet uh if you don't put in a lot of effort toencourage
 nuance and positive good vibes it's naturally going to decline into chaos

Speaker 1 :i would love to see someone do this well
 yeah um i think it's yeah very doable this is uh i think

Speaker 0 :actually so
 i i feel like twitter could be

Speaker 1 :overthrown joshua bach talked about how
 like uh if you have like and retweet likethat's only positive wiring right
 the only way to do anything like negative thereis um with a comment and
 that's like that asymmetry is what gives you know twitter its particulartoxicness
 whereas i find youtube comments to be much better because youtube commentshave a have a
 of an up and a down and they don't show the downloads

Speaker 0 :without getting into depth of this
 particular discussion the point is to explore possibilitiesand get a lot of data on it because uh
 i mean i could disagree with what you just said it's it's uh the point is it'sunclear
 it's a it hasn't been explored in a really rich waylike the these questions of how to
 create platforms that encourage positivity yeahi think it's a it's a technology problem
 and i think we'll look back at twitter as it is now maybe it'll happen withintwitter
 but most likely somebody overthrows them iswe'll look back at twitter and say we
 can't believe we put up with this level of toxicity you need a different

Speaker 1 :business model too
 any any social network that fundamentally has advertising as abusiness model
 this was in the social dilemma which i didn't watch but i liked it it's likeyou know there's always the you know
 you're the product you're not the uh but they had a nuanced take on it that ireally liked and it said
 the product being sold is influence over youthe product being sold is literally your
 you know influence on you likethat can't be if that's your idea okay
 well you know guess what it cannot be toxic

Speaker 0 :yeah
 maybe there's ways to spin it like with with uh givinga lot more control to the user and
 transparency to see what is happening to them as opposed toin the shadows as possible but that
 can't be the primary source of but the users aren't no one's going to

Speaker 1 :use that it depends


Speaker 0 :it depends it depends i think i think


Speaker 1 :that the you're
 you're not going to you can't depend on self-awareness of the users

Speaker 0 :it's a it's another it's a longer
 discussion because uh you can't depend on it butyou can reward self-awareness
 like if for the ones who are willing to put in the work of self-awarenessyou can reward them and incentivize and
 perhaps be pleasantly surprised how many peopleare are willing to be self-aware on the
 internet like we are in real life like i'mputting a lot of effort with you right
 now being self-aware about if i saysomething stupid or mean
 sure i'll like look at your like body language like i'm putting in that effortit's costly for an introvert it's very
 costly but on the internet itlike most people are like i don't care
 if if this hurts somebody i don't care if this uhis not interesting or if this is yeah
 the mean or whatever

Speaker 1 :i think so much of the engagement today
 on the internet is so disingenuous too yeah you're not doing this out of agenuine this is what you think you're
 doing this just straight up to manipulate others whether you're in youjust became an ad okay


Speaker 0 :okay let's talk about a fun topic which
 is programming here's another book idea for you let mepitch uh what's your uh perfect
 programming setup so like this by george hotz souh like what listen you're


Speaker 1 :giving me give me a macbook air sitting
 in a corner of a hotel room and you know

Speaker 0 :i'll still have so you really don't care
 you don't fetishize like multiple monitorskeyboard


Speaker 1 :uh those things are nice and i'm not
 going to say no to them but do they automatically unlock tons ofproductivity no not at all i have
 definitely been more productive on a macbook air in a corner of a hotel room

Speaker 0 :what about ide
 so uh which operating system do you love what uh text editor do youuse
 ide what um is there is there something thatis like the perfect if you could just
 say the perfect productivity set up for george hawks doesn't matterit doesn't doesn't matter


Speaker 1 :it really doesn't matter you know i
 guess i code most of the time in vim like literally i'm using an editor fromthe 70s you know you didn't
 make anything better okay vs code is nice for reading code there's a fewthings that are nice about
 it uh i think that they're you can build much better toolshow like ida's xrefs work way better
 than vx vs codes why

Speaker 0 :yeah actually that's a good question
 like why i i still use sorry emacs eat for most uhi've actually know i have to confess
 something dark cause i've never used bim yeahit's i think maybe i'm just afraid
 that my life has been a like a waste [Laughter]i'm so i'm not i'm not evangelical about
 emacs i

Speaker 1 :i think this this is how i feel about
 tender flow versus pie torch yeah having just like we've switchedeverything to pie torch now put months
 into the switch i have felt like i've wasted years ontensorflow i can't believe it
 i can't believe how much better pie torch is yeahi've used emacs and them doesn't matter


Speaker 0 :yeah still just my heart
 somehow i fell in love with lisp i don't know why you can'tthe heart wants what the heart wants i
 don't i don't understand it but it just connected with me maybe it's thefunctional language at first i connected
 with maybe it's because so many of the aicourses before the deep learning
 revolution were taught with lisp in mind i don't know i don'tknow what it is but i'm i'm
 stuck with it but at the same time like why am i not using a modern id for someof these programming like i don't know


Speaker 1 :they're not that much better i've used
 modernity to use them but at the same

Speaker 0 :time so
 to just not to disagree with you but like i like multiple monitorslike i've i have to do work on a laptop
 and it's a it's a pain in the ass and alsoi'm addicted to the
 kinesis weird keyboard that you could you could seeuh yeah so you don't have any of that
 you can just be in a macbook

Speaker 1 :i mean look at work i have three 24-inch
 monitors i have a happy hacking keyboard i have arazer death header mouse like but it's


Speaker 0 :not essential for you no
 let's go to a day in the life of george hotz what is theperfect day productivity-wise so we're
 not talking about like hunter s thompson uh drugs yeah and uhlet's let's look at productivity like
 what what's the day look like on like hour byhour is there any
 irregularities that create a magical george hawks experience

Speaker 1 :i can remember three days in my life and
 i remember these days vividly when i've gone through kind ofradical transformations to the way i
 think and what i would give i would pay ahundred thousand dollars if i could have
 one of these days tomorrow um the days have been so impactful andone was first discovering eliezer
 yukowski on the singularity and reading that stuff and like you knowmy mind was blown
 um the next was discovering uh the hutter price and then ai is justcompression
 like finally understanding aix i and what all that wasyou know i like read about it when i was
 18 19 i didn't understand it and then the fact that like lossless compressionimplies intelligence
 the day that i was shown that and then the third one is controversialthe day i found a blog called
 unqualified reservations and uh read that and i was like

Speaker 0 :wait which one is that that's uh what's
 the guy's name curtis garvin yeah so many people tell me i'm supposedto talk to him
 yeah but he looks he sounds insane or brilliantbut insane or both i don't know the day


Speaker 1 :i found that blog was another like this
 was during like like gamergate and kind of the run-up to the2016 election and i'm like
 wow okay the world makes sense now this this like i had a framework now tointerpret this just like i got the
 framework for ai and a framework to interpret technological progress likethose days when i discovered these new
 frameworks were oh interesting it's just

Speaker 0 :not about
 but what was special about those days how did those days come to beis it just you got lucky like sure i
 like well you just encounter hutter prize onuh on hack news or something like that
 um like what but you see i don't think

Speaker 1 :it's just
 see i don't think it's just that like i could have gotten lucky at any point ithink that in a way


Speaker 0 :you were ready at that moment yeah
 exactly to receive the information but is there some magic to the day todayof like
 like eating breakfast and it's the mundane thingsnah nothing no i drift i drift through


Speaker 1 :life


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :without structure i drift through life
 hoping and praying that i will get another day like those days

Speaker 0 :and there's nothing in particular you do
 to uh to be a receptacle for another for day number four

Speaker 1 :no i didn't do anything to get the other
 ones so i don't think i have to really do anything now i took a month-long tripto new york and
 i mean the ethereum thing was the highlight of it but the rest of it waspretty terrible
 i did a two-week road trip and i got i had to turn around i had to turn aroundi'm driving in uh
 in gunnison colorado i passed through gunnison and uhthe snow starts coming down this path up
 there called monarch pass in order to get through to denver you gotta get overthe rockies
 and i had to turn my car around i couldn't i watchedi watched a f-150 go off the road i'm
 like i gotta go back and like that day was meaningful becauselike like it was real like i actually
 had to turn my car around um it's rare that anything even realhappens in my life even as
 you know mundane is the fact that yeah there was snowi had to turn around stay in gunnison
 and leave the next day something about

Speaker 0 :that moment for
 real okay so actually it's interesting to break apart the three moments youmentioned
 if it's okay so uh i always have trouble pronouncing his name butallows yakowski yeah
 so what how did your world view change in starting toconsider
 the the exponential growth of ai and agi thathe thinks about and the the the threats
 of artificial intelligence and all that kind of ideas likecan you is it j like can you maybe uh
 break apart like what exactly was so magical to use atransformational experience


Speaker 1 :today everyone knows him for threats and
 ai safety um this was pre that stuff there was i don't think amention of ai safety on the page
 um this is this is old yukowski stuff he'd probably denounce it all now he'dprobably be like that's exactly what i
 didn't want to happen well sorry man

Speaker 0 :is there something specific you can take
 from his work that you can remember

Speaker 1 :yeah uh it was this realization that
 uh computers double in power every 18 monthsand humans do not and they haven't
 crossed yet but if you have one thing that'sdoubling every 18 months and one thing
 that's staying like this you know here's your log graph here'syour line
 you know you calculate that

Speaker 0 :and that did that open the door to the
 exponential thinking like thinking that like you know whatwith technology we can actually
 transformed the world

Speaker 1 :it opened the door to human obsolescence
 it opened the door to realize that in my lifetimehumans are going to be replaced


Speaker 0 :and then the matching idea to that of
 artificial intelligence with the hutter prizeyou know i'm torn i go back and forth on
 what i think about it yeah but the the the basic thesisis it's nice to com it's a nice
 compelling notion that we can reduce the task of creating anintelligent system a general
 intelligence system into the task of compression so you canthink of all of intelligence in the
 universe in fact as a kind of compressiondo you find that was that just at the
 time you found that as a compelling idea do you still find that

Speaker 1 :a compelling idea i still find that
 compelling idea um i think that it's not that useful dayto day
 but actually um one of maybe my quests before that was a search for thedefinition of the word intelligence
 and i never had one and i definitely have a definition of the wordcompression
 it's a very uh simple uh straightforward oneand uh you know what confession is you
 know what lossless is lossless compassion not lossy losslesscompression
 and that that is equivalent to intelligence which i believei'm not sure how useful that definition
 is day to day but like i now have a framework to understand what it is

Speaker 0 :and he just 10x 10xed the uh the prize
 for that competition like recently a few months agoyou ever thought of taking a crack at


Speaker 1 :that oh i did
 oh i did i spent i spent the next after i found the prize i spent the nextsix months of my life trying it and uh
 well that's when i started learning everything aboutai and then i worked vicarious for a bit
 and then i learned read all the deep learning stuff and i'mlike okay now i like i'm called up to
 modern ai wow and i had i had a really goodframework to put it all in from the
 compression stuff right like some of the first uh some ofthe first deep learning models i played
 with were uh like gpt basically but beforetransformers before it was still
 uh rnn's to to do uh character prediction but by the way on

Speaker 0 :the compression side
 i mean the especially neural networks what do you make of the losslessrequirement with the hudder prize so
 you know human intelligence and neural networks can probably compressstuff pretty well but it would be lossy
 it's imperfect

Speaker 1 :uh you can turn a lossy compressor into
 a lossless compressor pretty easily using an arithmetic encoder right youcan take an arithmetic encoder
 and you can just encode the noise with maximum efficiencyright so even if you can't predict
 exactly what the next character is the better a probability distributionyou can put over the next character
 you can then use an arithmetic encoder to uh right you don't have to knowwhether it's an e or an i
 you just have to put good probabilities on them and then you know code thoseand if you have it's a bits of entropy
 thing right

Speaker 0 :so let me on that topic could be
 interesting as a little side tour what are your thoughts in this yearabout gpt3
 and these language models and these transformers is there somethinginteresting
 to you as an ai researcher or is there something interesting to youas an autonomous vehicle developer nah i


Speaker 1 :think uh
 i think it's overhyped i mean it's not like it's cool it's cool for what it isbut no
 we're not just going to be able to scale up to gpg 12 and getgeneral-purpose intelligence like your
 loss function is literally just you know you knowcross-entropy loss on the character
 right like that's not the loss function of general intelligence

Speaker 0 :is that obvious to you yes can you
 imagine that like to play devil's advocate onyourself is it
 possible that you can the gpt-12 will achieve general intelligencewith something as dumb as this kind of
 loss function

Speaker 1 :i guess it depends what you mean by
 general intelligence so there's another problem with the gptsand that's that they don't have
 a uh they don't have long-term memory right right so like justgpt 12 a scaled up version of gpt two or
 three i find it hard to believe

Speaker 0 :well you can scale it in it's yeah so
 it's a hardcore hard-coded length but you can make itwider and wider and wider yeah


Speaker 1 :you're gonna get you're gonna get cool
 things from those systems but i i don't think you're ever gonnaget something that can like
 you know build me a rocket ship what

Speaker 0 :about solve driving
 so you know you can use transformer with video for exampleyou think is there something in there no


Speaker 1 :because
 hey look we use we as a group we use a group we could change that group out toa transformer
 um i think driving is much more markovian than language

Speaker 0 :so markov you mean like the memory which
 which aspect of uh

Speaker 1 :i mean that like most of the information
 in the state at t minus one is also in the in is in statet yeah right and it kind of like drops
 off nicely like this where sometime withlanguage you have to refer back to the
 third paragraph on the second page i feel like there's not many like likeyou can say like speed limit signs but
 there's really not many things in autonomous driving that look like that

Speaker 0 :but if you look at uh to play devil's
 advocate is uh the risk estimation thing thatyou've talked about it's kind of
 interesting is uh it feels like there might be somelonger term
 uh aggregation of context necessary to be able to figure out likethe context yeah i'm not even sure i'm
 i'm believing my my own devil's we have

Speaker 1 :a nice we have a nice like vision model
 which outputs like a a one two four dimensional perceptionspace um
 can i try transformers on it sure i probably willat some point we'll try transformers and
 then we'll just see do they do better sure

Speaker 0 :i'm well it might not be a game changer


Speaker 1 :no well i'm not like like
 might transformers work better than grooves for autonomous driving suremight we switch sure is this some
 radical change no okay we use a slightly different youknow we switch from rnns to grooves
 like okay maybe it's greased to transformers but no it's not

Speaker 0 :yeah i well on the on the topic of
 general intelligence i don't know how much i've talked to you about itlike what um
 do you think will actually build an agi like if if you look at ray kurzweil witha singularity do
 you have like an intuition about you're kind of saying driving is easyyeah and i
 i tend to personally believe that solving drivingwill have really deep important
 impacts on our ability to solve general intelligencelike i i think driving doesn't require
 general intelligence but i think they're going to beneighbors in a way that it's like deeply
 tied because it's so like driving is sodeeply connected to the human experience
 that i think solving one will help solve the otherbut but so i don't see i don't see
 driving is like easy and almost like separate thangeneral intelligence but like what's
 your vision of a future with a singular doyou see there'll be a single moment like
 a singularity where it'll be a phase shiftare we in the singularity now like what
 do you have crazy ideas about the future in terms of

Speaker 1 :agi we're definitely in the singularity
 now um we are coolers of course look at the bandwidthbetween people the bandwidth between
 people goes up all right um the singularity is just youknow when the bandwidth but


Speaker 0 :what do you mean by the bandwidth of the


Speaker 1 :people communications tools the whole
 world is networked the whole world is networked and weraise the speed of that network right


Speaker 0 :oh so you think the communication of
 information in a distributed way is a empowering thingfor collective intelligence


Speaker 1 :oh i didn't say it's necessarily a good
 thing but i think that's like when i think of the definition of thesingularity yeah it seems kind of right


Speaker 0 :i see like it's a change in the world
 beyond which like the world be transformed in waysthat we can't possibly imagine no i mean


Speaker 1 :i think we're in the singularity now in
 the sense that there's like you know one world and a monoculture and it's alsolinked
 yeah i mean i i kind of shared the

Speaker 0 :intuition that
 the the singularity will originate from the collective intelligenceof us ants versus the like some single
 system agi type thing oh i totally agree with that

Speaker 1 :yeah i don't i don't really believe in
 like like a hard take off agi kind of thingum yeah i don't think i don't even think
 ai is all that different in kind from what we've already beenbuilding
 um with respect to driving i think driving is a subset of generalintelligence and i think it's a pretty
 complete subset i think the tools we develop at commawill also be extremely helpful
 to solving general intelligence and that's i think the real reason why i'mdoing it
 i don't care about self-driving cars it's a cool problem to beat people at

Speaker 0 :but yeah i mean yeah you're kind of
 you're of two minds so one you do have to have a mission andyou want to focus and make sure you
 get you get there you can't forget that butat the same time there is a thread
 that's much bigger than uh the connects the entiretyof your effort that's much bigger than
 just driving

Speaker 1 :with ai and with general intelligence it
 is so easy to delude yourself into thinking you've figured somethingout when you haven't if we build a level
 5 self-driving car we have indisputably built somethingyeah
 is it general intelligence i'm not going to debate that i will say we've builtsomething
 that provides huge financial value yeah

Speaker 0 :beautifully put that's the engineering
 credo like just just build the thing it's like that's why i'm with uh withthe with elon on uh
 go to mars yeah that's a great one you can argue likewho the hell cares about going to mars
 but the reality is set that as a mission get it done yeahand then you're going to crack some pro
 problem that you've never even expected in the process of doing that yeah

Speaker 1 :yeah i mean no i think if i had a choice
 between humanity going to mars and solving self-driving cars i think goingto mars is uh
 better but i don't know i'm more suited for self-driving cars i'm an informationguy i'm not a modernist i'm a
 postmodernist

Speaker 0 :post modernist all right beautifully put
 let me let me drag you back to programming for a sec whatthree maybe three to five programming
 languages should people learn do you think like if you look atyourself what did you get the most out
 of from learning uh well so everybody

Speaker 1 :should learn
 c and assembly we'll start with those two right assemblyyeah if you can't code in assembly you
 don't know what the computer's doing you don't understand like you don't haveto be great in assembly but you have to
 code in it and then like you have to appreciate assembly in order toappreciate all the great things c
 gets you and then you have to code and see in order to appreciate all the greatthings python gets you
 so i'll just say assembly c and python we'll start with those three

Speaker 0 :the memory allocation of of c and the
 the the fact that so assemblies give you a sense of just how many levels ofabstraction
 you get to work on in modern day programs yeah yeah graph coloring for

Speaker 1 :assignment register assignment and
 compilers yeah like you know you got to do you know the compiler your computeronly has a certain number of registers
 you can have all the variables you want a cfunction you know so you get to start


Speaker 0 :your build intuition about
 compilation like what a compiler gets you

Speaker 1 :what else um well then there's then
 there's kind of uh so those are all very imperativeprogramming languages um
 then there's two other paradigms for programming that everybody should befamiliar with
 i'm one of them is functional uh you should learn haskell and take that allthe way through
 learn a language with dependent types likelearn that whole space like the very pl
 theory heavy languages and haskell is your

Speaker 0 :favorite functional
 what is that the go-to you would say

Speaker 1 :yeah i'm not a great haskell programmer
 i wrote a compiler in haskell once there'sanother paradigm and actually there's
 one more paradigm that i'll even talk aboutafter that that i never used to talk
 about when i would think about this but the next paradigm is learn verilog ofhdl
 um understand this idea of all of the instructions execute at onceif i have a block in verilog and i write
 stuff in it it's not sequential they all execute itonce
 and then like think like that that's how hardware works

Speaker 0 :to be so i guess assembly doesn't quite
 get you that assembly's more about compilation andverilog is more about the hardware
 like giving a sense of what actually is the hardware is doing

Speaker 1 :assembly c python are straight like they
 sit right on top of each other in fact c is well let's see it's kind of coded inc but you could imagine the first c was
 coded in assembly and python is actually coded in cum so you know you can straight up go on
 that

Speaker 0 :got it and then verilog gives you that's
 brilliant

Speaker 1 :okay and then i think there's another
 one now everyone should carpathi calls it programming 2.0which is learn a i'm not even gonna
 don't learn tensorflow learn pi torch so

Speaker 0 :machine learning
 we've got to come up with a better term than programming 2.0 or um

Speaker 1 :but yeah it's a programming language


Speaker 0 :i wonder if it could be formalized a
 little bit better which we feels like we're in the early daysof what that actually entails


Speaker 1 :data-driven programming


Speaker 0 :data-driven programming yeah but it's so
 fundamentally different as a paradigm than the others uh like it almostrequires a different skill set
 but you think it's still yeah and ply torch versus tensorflow pytorchwins it's the fourth paradigm it's the


Speaker 1 :fourth paradigm that i've kind of seen
 there's like this you know imperative functional hardware i don't know abetter word for it


Speaker 0 :and then ml do you have advice
 for people uh that want to you know get into programming want to learnprogramming you have a
 a video uh what is programming new blessings exclamation pointand i think the top comment is like
 warning this is not for noobs uh do you have a noob like uhtldw for that video but also uh
 a new but friendly advice on how to get into programming you are

Speaker 1 :never going to learn programming by
 watching a video called learn programming the only way tolearn programming i think and the only
 one is the only way everyone i've ever met who can programwell learned it all in the same way they
 had something they wanted to do and then they tried to do it and thenthey were like
 oh well okay this is kind of you know be nice if the computer could kind of dothis thing and then
 you know that's how you learn you just keep pushing on a projectum so the only advice i have for
 learning programming is go program

Speaker 0 :somebody wrote to me a question like we
 don't really they're looking to learn about recurringneural networks
 he's saying like my company is thinking of doing recruit using recurring neuralnetworks for time series data
 but we don't really have an idea of where to use it yetwe just want to like do you have any
 advice on how to learn about these are these kind of general machinelearning questions and i think
 the answer is like actually have a problem that you're trying tosolve and and just i see that stuff oh


Speaker 1 :my god when people talk like that
 they're like i heard machine learning's importantcould you help us integrate machine
 learning with macaroni and cheese productionyou just i don't even you can't help
 these people like who lets you run anything who lets that kind of personrun anything


Speaker 0 :i think we're we're all um we're all
 beginners at some point so it's not like they're a beginner it's

Speaker 1 :it's like
 my problem is not that they don't know about machine learning my problem isthat they think that
 machine learning has something to say about macaroni and cheese productionor like i heard about this new
 technology how can i use it for why like i don't know what it is but how cani use it for why


Speaker 0 :that's true you have to build up an
 intuition of how because you might be able to figure out a way butlike the prerequisites you should have a
 macaroni and cheese problem to solve firstexactly and then two you should
 have more traditional like in the learning process should involvemore traditionally applicable problems
 in the space of whatever that is of machine learningand then see if it could be applied to


Speaker 1 :background at least start with tell me
 about a problem like if you have a problem you're likeyou know some of my boxes aren't getting
 enough macaroni in them um can we use machine learning to solvethis problem that's
 much much better than how do i apply machine learning to macaroni and cheese

Speaker 0 :one big thing maybe this is me uh
 talking to the audience a little bit because i get these daysso many messages a device on how to like
 learn stuff okay my this this this is not me being mean ithink this is quite a profound actually
 is you should google it oh yeah like one of the uhlike skills that you should really
 acquire as an engineer as a researcher as a thinker like onethere's two
 two complementary skills like one is with a blank sheet of paper with nointernet to think deeply
 and then the other is to google the crap out of the questions you have likethat's actually a skill i
 don't people often talk about but like doing research like pulling at thethread like looking up different words
 going into like github repositories with two stars andlike looking how they did stuff like
 looking at the code or going on twitter seeing like there's little pockets ofbrilliant people that are like having
 discussions like if you're a neuroscientist go intosignal processing community if you're an
 ai person going into the psychology community like like switchcommunities that keep searching
 searching searching because it's so much betterto invest in like finding somebody else
 who already solved your problem than than this to try to solve theproblem and because they've
 often invested years of their life like entire communitiesare probably already out there who have
 tried to solve your problem

Speaker 1 :i think they're the same thing i think
 you go try to solve the problem and then in trying to solve the problemif you're good at solving problems
 you'll stumble upon the person who solved it already yeah

Speaker 0 :but the stumbling is really important i
 think that's a skill that people should really approach especially in undergradlike search if you ask me a question how
 should i get started in deep learning like especiallylike that is just so google like
 the whole point is you google that and you get a million pagesand just start looking at them yeah
 start pulling at the thread start exploring start taking notes startgetting it
 advice from a million people that already like spent theirlife answering that question actually oh


Speaker 1 :well yeah i mean that's definitely also
 yeah when people like ask me things like that i'm like trust me the top answer ongoogle is much much better than anything
 i'm going to tell you

Speaker 0 :right yeah people ask
 it's an interesting question let me know if you have any recommendations whatthree books
 technical or fiction or philosophical had an impacton your life or you would recommend
 perhaps uh

Speaker 1 :maybe we'll start with the least
 controversial uh infinite jest um infinite jest is a

Speaker 0 :david foster wallace yeah it's a book


Speaker 1 :about wireheading really
 very enjoyable to read very uh well-writtenyou know you will you will you will grow
 as a person reading this book uh it's effort um and i'll set that upfor the second book which is pornography
 it's called atlas shrugged um uh which um atlas drug is pornography

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :i mean it is i will not i will not
 defend the i will not say atlas shrugged is a well-written bookit is entertaining to read certainly
 just like pornography the production value isn't great um youknow there's a 60-page
 monologue in there that ann rand's editor really wanted to take outand she uh paid she paid out of her
 pocket to keep that 60 page monologue in the bookum but it is a great book for a kind of
 framework um of human relations and i know a lot of people are like yeahbut it's a terrible framework
 yeah but it's a framework just for

Speaker 0 :context
 in a couple days i'm speaking with for uhprobably four plus hours with euron
 brook who's the main living remaining objectivistsobjectivist interesting uh so
 i've always found this philosophy quite interesting on many levels one of howrepulsive
 some percent of large percent of the population find itwhich is always uh always funny to me
 when people are like unable to even read aphilosophy
 because uh of some i think that says more about their psychologicalperspective on it
 yeah but but there is something about objectivism and iran's philosophy that'svery deeply connected to this idea of
 capitalism of uh the ethical life is the productivelife
 um that was always um compelling to me it didn't seem as likei didn't seem to interpret it in the
 negative sense that some people do

Speaker 1 :to be fair i read that book when i was
 19. so you had an impact at that point

Speaker 0 :yeah


Speaker 1 :yeah and the the bad guys in the book
 have this slogan from each according to their ability to each according to theirneed
 and i'm looking at this and i'm like these are the most cards this is teamrocket level cartoonishness
 right no bad guy and then when i realized that was actually the slogan ofthe communist party
 i'm like wait a second wait no no no no no just you're telling me this reallyhappened yeah it's interesting i mean


Speaker 0 :one of the criticisms of her work is she
 has a cartoonish view of good and evil likethat there's like the the reality isn't
 jordan peterson says this is that each of us have the capacity forgood and evil in us as opposed to like
 there's some characters who are purely evil and some characters are purely goodand that's in a way why it's


Speaker 1 :pornographic


Speaker 0 :the production value i love it well evil


Speaker 1 :is punished and there's very clearly
 you know there's no there's no you know uh just like porn doesn't have uh youknow like character growth well you know
 neither does alex shrugged like

Speaker 0 :brilliant well put but as a 19 year old
 george cotts it was it was good enough yeah yeah what uhwhat's the third


Speaker 1 :you have something um i i could give
 these these two i'll just throw out uh there's sci-fi uh permutation cityum great things to start thinking about
 copies of yourself and then um that is uh greg eganuh he's uh that might not be his real
 name some australian guy might not be australiani don't know um and then this one's
 online it's called the metamorphosis of prime intellectum it's a story set in a
 post-singularity world it's interesting

Speaker 0 :is there uh can you if either of the
 worlds do you find something uh philosophy interesting in them that youcan comment on


Speaker 1 :i mean it is clear to me that uh
 metamorphosis prime intellect is like written byan engineer uh which is
 it's very it's very almost a pragmatic take on a utopia in a way

Speaker 0 :positive or negative well that's up to


Speaker 1 :you to decide reading the book
 and the ending of it is very interesting as well and i didn't realize what it wasi first read that when i was 15. i've
 reread that book several times in my lifeand it's sure it's 50 pages everyone
 should go read it

Speaker 0 :what's uh sorry this is a little tangent
 i've been working through the foundation i've been i've haven't read much sci-fimy whole life and i'm trying to fix that
 the last few months that's been a little side projectwhat's uh to use the greatest sci-fi
 novel uh that uh people should read or is thator


Speaker 1 :i mean i would yeah i would i would say
 like yeah permutation city metamorphosis environmental i got itum i don't know i i didn't like
 foundation uh i thought it was way too modernist

Speaker 0 :i feel like dune i've never read dune


Speaker 1 :i've never read dune i have to read it
 uh fire upon the deep is interesting uhokay i mean look everyone should read
 everyone's reading romance everyone should read snow crashif you haven't read those like start
 there um yeah i haven't read snow questionsyeah no it means very entertaining go to
 lecture bach and if you want the controversial onebronze age mindset


Speaker 0 :all right i'll look into that one those


Speaker 1 :aren't sci-fi
 but just to round out books so

Speaker 0 :a bunch of people asked me on twitter
 and read it and so on for advice so what advice would you give a youngperson today about life


Speaker 1 :another way


Speaker 0 :what uh yeah i mean looking back
 especially when you're young younger you did and you continuedit
 you've accomplished a lot of interesting thingsis there some advice from those


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :i'm that life of yours that you can pass


Speaker 1 :on if college ever opens again i would
 love to give a graduation speech um at that point i will put a lot ofsomewhat satirical effort into this
 question

Speaker 0 :yeah at this you haven't written
 anything at this point

Speaker 1 :oh you know what always wear sunscreen
 this is water

Speaker 0 :like you're plagiarizing i mean you know


Speaker 1 :but that's the that's the like clean
 your room you know yeah you can play drugs fromfrom all this stuff and it's it's
 there is no self-help books aren't designed to help you they're designed tomake you feel good
 like whatever advice i could give you already knoweveryone already knows sorry it doesn't
 feel good

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :right like you know you know what what
 if if i tell you that you should you knoweat well and and and read more and
 it's not gonna do anything i think the whole like genre of those kind ofquestions is
 is is meaningless i don't know if anythingit's don't worry so much about that
 stuff don't be so caught up in your head

Speaker 0 :right i mean you're yeah in the sense
 that your whole life is your whole existence is like movingversion of that advice
 i don't know yeah there's there's something i mean there'ssomething in you that resists that kind
 of thinking and that in itself is it's just illustrative of uhwho you are and there's something to
 learn from that i think you're you're clearly notoverthinking stuff


Speaker 1 :yeah and you know it's a gut thing i
 even when i talk about my advice i'm like my advice is only relevant to meit's not relevant to anybody else i'm
 not saying you should go out if you're the kind of person who overthinks thingsto stop overthinking things it's not bad
 it doesn't work for me maybe it works for you i you know i don't know

Speaker 0 :let me ask you about love yeah
 uh so i think last time we talked about the meaning of lifeand it was it was kind of about winning
 of course uh i don't think i've talked to you aboutlove much whether romantic or just love
 for the common humanity amongst us all whatrole has love played in your life in
 this in this quest for winning where doeslove fit in


Speaker 1 :well the word love i think means uh
 several different things there's uh love in the sense of maybe i couldjust say there's like love in the sense
 of opiates and love in the sense of uh oxytocin and then love in the senseof
 maybe like a love for math i don't think fits into either those first twoparadigms


Speaker 0 :uh so each of those have they uh
 have they have they given something to youin your life i'm not that big of a fan


Speaker 1 :of the first two
 um what

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :the same reason i'm not a fan of you
 know the same reason i don't do opiates and don't take ecstasyright
 and there were times look i've tried both umi like opiates way more than i liked
 ecstasy uh but they're not the ethical life is the productive lifeso maybe that's
 my problem with with those and then like yeah a sense ofi don't know like abstract love for
 humanity i mean the abstract love for humanityi'm like yeah i've always
 felt that and i guess it's hard for me to imagine not feeling it and maybethere's people who don't and


Speaker 0 :i don't know but yeah that's just like a
 background thing that's there i mean since we brought up uh drugs letme ask you
 this is becoming more and more part of my life because i'm talking a fewresearchers that are working on
 psychedelics i've eaten shrooms a couple times and itwas
 fascinating to me that like the mind can golike it's fascinating the mine can go to
 places i didn't imagine it could go and it wasvery friendly and and positive and
 exciting and everything was kind of hilarious in thein the place wherever my mind went
 that's where i went is uh what do you think aboutpsychedelics do you think they have
 where do you think the mind goes have you done psychedelicswhere do you think the mind goes uh is
 there something useful to learn about the places it goesonce you come back you know i find it


Speaker 1 :interesting
 that this idea that psychedelics have something to teachis almost unique to psychedelics right
 people don't argue this about amphetamines and

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :that's true and i'm not really sure why
 yeah i think all of the drugs have lessons to teach ithink there's things to learn from
 opiates i think there's things to learn from amphetamines i think there's thingsto learn from psychedelics things to
 learn from marijuana um but also at the same timerecognize that i don't think you're
 learning things about the world i think you're learning things about yourselfyes um and you know what's the
 even though it might have even been uh might have been a timothy leary quote idon't want to miss about him but the
 idea is basically like you know everybody should look behindthe door but then once you've seen
 behind the door you don't need to keep going backum so i mean and that's my thoughts on
 on all real drug use too except maybe for caffeine it's a it's a

Speaker 0 :little experience
 that uh it's good to have but oh yeah no

Speaker 1 :i mean
 yeah i guess yeah psychedelics are definitely um

Speaker 0 :so you're a fan of new experiences i
 suppose yes because they all contain a little especially the firstfew times it contains some lessons that
 could be picked up

Speaker 1 :yeah and i'll i'll revisit psychedelics
 maybe once a year um usually small smaller dosesmaybe they turn up the learning rate of
 your brain i've heard that

Speaker 0 :i like that yeah that's cool big


Speaker 1 :learning rates have pros and cons


Speaker 0 :last question this is a little weird one
 but you've called yourself crazy in the past uhfirst of all on a scale of one to ten
 how crazy would you say

Speaker 1 :are you oh i mean it depends how you you
 know when you compare me to elon musk and anthony lewandowski not so crazy

Speaker 0 :so like like a seven let's go with six


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :six yes six what uh


Speaker 1 :well like seven seven's a good number


Speaker 0 :seven sorry well yeah i'm sure
 day by day changes right so but you're in thatin that area what uh
 in thinking about that what do you think is the role of madnessis that a feature or a bug if you were
 to uh dissect your

Speaker 1 :brain so okay from like a
 like mental health lens on crazy i'm not sure i really believe in thati'm not sure i really believe in like
 a lot of that stuff right this concept ofokay you know when you get over to like
 like like like hardcore bipolar and schizophrenia thesethings are clearly
 real somewhat biological and then over here on the spectrum you have likea dd and oppositional defiance disorder
 and these things that are like wait this isnormal spectrum human behavior like this
 isn't you know where's the the line here andwhy is this like a
 problem so there's this whole this you know the neurodiversity of humanity ishuge like people think i'm always on
 drugs people are saying this to me on my streams and like guys you know like i'mreal open with my drug use i'd tell you
 if i was on drugs yeah i had like a cup of coffee thismorning but other than that this is just
 me

Speaker 0 :you're witnessing my brain and action
 so so the word madness doesn't even uh make sense and then you're in the richneurodiversity of


Speaker 1 :humans i think it makes sense but only
 for like some insane extremes like if youare
 actually like visibly hallucinating um you know that's okay but there is the

Speaker 0 :kind of spectrum on which you stand out
 like that that's uh like if i were to look you know at decorations on achristmas tree or something like that
 like if you were a decoration out that would catch my eye likethat thing is sparkly
 whatever the hell that thing is uh there's something to thatjust like refusing to be um
 boring or maybe boring is the wrong word but to umyeah i mean be willing to sparkle


Speaker 1 :you know it's it's like somewhat
 constructed i mean i am who i choose to be uhi'm gonna say things as true as i can
 see them i'm not gonna i'm not gonna

Speaker 0 :lie and but that's a really important
 feature in itself so like whatever the neurodiversity of yourwhatever your brain is not putting um
 constraints on it that force it to to fit into the mold of what society islike
 defines what you're supposed to be so you're one of the specimens thatthat doesn't mind being yourself


Speaker 1 :being right is super important
 except at the expense of being wrong

Speaker 0 :without breaking that apart i think it's
 a beautiful way to end it and george you're one of the most special humans iknow it's truly an honor to talk to you
 thanks so much for doing it thank you

Speaker 1 :for having me
