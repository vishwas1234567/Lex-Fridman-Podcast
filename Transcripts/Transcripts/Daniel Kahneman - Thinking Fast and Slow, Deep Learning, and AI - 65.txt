Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 Daniel Kahneman winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics for his integrationof economic science with a psychology of
 human behavior judgment and decision-making he's the author of thepopular book Thinking Fast and Slow that
 summarizes in an accessible way his research of several decades often incollaboration with Amos Tversky a
 cognitive biases prospect theory and happiness the central thesis of thiswork is the dichotomy between two modes
 of thought what he calls system one is fast instinctive and emotional systemtwo is slower more deliberative and more
 logical the book delineates cognitive biases associated with each of these two

 conversation with Daniel Kahneman you tell a story of an SS soldier early inthe war world war two in nazi-occupied
 France and Paris where you grew up he picked you up and hugged you andshowed you a picture of a boy maybe not
 realizing that you were Jewish

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :not maybe certainly not so I told you
 I'm from the Soviet Union that was significantly impacted by the words welland I'm Jewish as well what do you think
 World War two taught us about human

Speaker 1 :psychology broadly well I think the the
 only big surprise is the extermination policy genocide by the German peoplethat's when you look back on it and you
 know I think that's a major surprise

Speaker 0 :it's a surprise because it's a surprise


Speaker 1 :that they could do it it's a surprise
 that they that enough people willingly participated in that this is this is asurprise
 now it's no longer a surprise but it's changed many people's views I thinkabout about human beings certainly for
 me the Ackman trial in a teaches you something because it's very clear thatif it could happen in Germany it could
 happen anywhere it's not that the Germans were special this could happen

Speaker 0 :anyway so what do you think that is do
 you think we're all capable of evil we're all capable of cruelty I don't

Speaker 1 :think in those terms I think that what
 is certainly possible is you can dehumanize people so thatthere you treat them
 not as people anymore but as animals and and the same way that you can slaughteranimals without feeling much of anything
 it can the same and when you feel that the I think the combination ofdehumanizing the other side and and
 having uncontrolled power over other people I think that doesn't bring outour the most generous aspect of human
 nature so that Nazi soldier you know he he was a good man I mean you know and hewas perfectly capable of killing a lot
 of people and I'm sure he did

Speaker 0 :but what what did the Jewish people mean
 to Nazis so what the dismissal of Jewish

Speaker 1 :as well worthy of again this is
 surprising that it was so extreme but it's not one thing in human nature Idon't want to call it evil but the
 distinction between the in-group and the out-group that is very basicso that's built in the the loyalty and
 affection towards in-group and the willingness to dehumanize the out-groupthat's that is in human nature and
 that's that's what I think probably didn't need the Holocaust to teach usthat but the Holocaust is a very sharp
 lesson of you know what can happen to people and when the people can do so the

Speaker 0 :effect of the in-group and the out-group


Speaker 1 :you know that it's clear that those were
 people you know you could you could shoot them you could you know they werenot human they were not there was no
 empathy or very very little empathy left so occasionally you know they might havebeen and and very quickly by the way the
 empathy disappeared if there was initially and the fact that everybodyaround you was doing it
 that that completely the group doing it and everybody shooting Jews I think thatthat makes it permissible now how much
 you know whether it would it could happen or in every culture or whetherthe Germans were just particularly
 efficient and and disciplined so they could get away with it that is a

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :question it's an interesting question


Speaker 0 :are these artifacts of history or is it


Speaker 1 :human nature I think that's really human
 nature you know you put some people in a position of power relative to otherpeople and and then they become as human


Speaker 0 :become different but in general and war
 outside of concentration camps in World War twoit seems that war brings out darker
 sides of human nature but also the beautiful things about human nature well

Speaker 1 :no I mean but it what it brings out is
 the loyalty among soldiers I mean it brings out the bonding male bonding Ithink is a very real thing that and that
 happens and so and and there is a student of thrill to friendship andthere is certainly a certain thrill to
 friendship under risk and to shared risk and so people have very profoundemotions up to the point where it gets
 so traumatic that that little is left

Speaker 0 :but so let's talk about psychology a
 little bit in your book Thinking Fast and Slow you described two modes ofthoughts as the one the fast instinctive
 an emotional one is system to the slower deliberate logical one at the risk ofasking Darwin to discuss a theory of
 evolution can you describe distinguishingcharacteristics for people who have not
 read your book of the two systems well I

Speaker 1 :mean the mood
 system is a bit misleading but it's at the same time it's misleading it's alsovery useful but what I call system one
 it's easier to think of it as as a family of activities and primarily theway I describe it is there are different
 ways for ideas to come to my mind and some ideas come to mind automaticallyand the example a standard example is
 two plus two and then something happens to you and and in other cases you've gotto do something you got to work in order
 to produce the idea and my example I always give the same pair of numbers is27 times 14 I think you have to perform


Speaker 0 :some algorithm in your heads and yes and


Speaker 1 :and it takes time it's a very difference
 nothing comes to mind except something comes to mind which is the algorithm Imean that you've got to perform and then
 it's work and it engages short-term memory and thing ages executive functionand it makes you incapable of doing
 other things at the same time so the the main characteristic of system 2 is thatthere is mental effort involved and
 there is a limited capacity for mental effort where a system one is effortlessessentially that's the major distinction


Speaker 0 :so you talk about there you know it's
 really convenient to talk about two systems but you also mentioned just nowand in general that there's no distinct
 two systems in the brain from a neurobiological even from psychologyperspective but why does it seem to from
 the experiments you've conducted there does seem to be kind of emergent twomodes of thinking so at some point these
 kinds of systems came into a brain architecturemaybe ma'am will share it but the or do
 you not think of it at all in those terms that it's all on mush and these

Speaker 1 :two things just emerge you know
 evolutionary theory saying about this is cheap and easier so it's the way I thinkabout it is that it's very clear that
 animals have a perceptual system and that includes an ability to understandthe world at least to the extent that
 they can predict they can't explain anything but they can anticipate what'sgoing to happen and that's the key form
 of understanding the world and my crude idea is that we would I call system -well system - grew out of this and you
 know there is language and there is the capacity of manipulating our ideas andthe capacity of imagining futures and of
 imagining counterfactuals thing that haven't happened and and to doconditional thinking and there are
 really a lot of abilities that without language and without the the very largebrain that we have compared to others it
 would be impossible now system one is more like what the animalsare but system one also can talk I mean
 it has language it understands language indeed it speaks for us I mean you knowI'm not choosing every word you know as
 a deliberate process the words I have some idea and then the words come outand that's automatic and effortless and


Speaker 0 :many of experiments you've done is to
 show that listen system won't exist and it does speak for us and we should becareful about it's the voice it provides


Speaker 1 :well it's I mean you know we have to
 trust it because it's the speed at which it acts a system is usable if we if wedepend on one system to for survival we
 wouldn't survive very long because it's

Speaker 0 :very slow yeah crossing the street


Speaker 1 :crossing a street I mean many things
 depend on there being automatic one very important aspect of system one is thatit's not instinct
 you use the word instinct that it contains skills that clearly have beenlearned so that skilled behavior like
 driving a car or speaking in fact skilled behavior has to be learned andso it doesn't you know you don't come
 equipped with with driving you have to learn how to drive and and you have togo through a period where driving is not
 automatic before it becomes automatic

Speaker 0 :so yeah you construct I mean this is
 where you talk about heuristic and biases you to make it automatic youcreate a pattern and then system one
 essentially matches a new experience against a previously seen pattern andwhen that match is not a good one that's
 when the cognate all of them all the mess happens but it's most of the timeit works and so it's pretty most of the


Speaker 1 :time the anticipation of what's going to
 happen next is correct and and most of the time the plan about what you have todo is correct and so most of the time
 everything works just fine what's interesting actually is that in somesense system one is much better at what
 it does and system tool is at what it does thatis there is that quality of effortlessly
 solving enormous ly complicated problems which clearly exists so that the chessplayer a very good chess player all the
 moves that come to their mind are strong moves so all the selection of strongmoves happens unconsciously and
 automatically and very very fast and and all that is in system one so you asystem two verifies so along this line


Speaker 0 :of thinking really what we are our
 machines that construct a pretty effective system one you could think ofit that way so so we're now talking
 about humans but if we think about building artificial intelligence systemsrobots do you think all the features in
 bug that you have highlighted in humanbeings are useful for constructing AI
 systems so both systems are useful for perhaps while instilling in robots what

Speaker 1 :is happening these days is that actually
 what is happening in deep learning is is more like a system one product than likea system to product I mean deep learning
 mattress patterns and anticipate what's going to happen so it's highlypredictive what's right what deep
 learning doesn't have and you know many people think that this is the criticalit it doesn't have the ability to reason
 so it it does and there is no system to bear but I think very importantly itdoesn't have any causality or any way to
 represent meaning and to represent real interaction so until that is solved theyou know what can be accomplished is
 marvelous and very exciting but limited

Speaker 0 :that's actually really nice to think of
 current advances in machine learning is essentially system one advances so howfar can we get with just system one if
 we think of learning and artificial

Speaker 1 :systems and we know it's very clear that
 deep mind is already gone we're way beyond what people thought was possibleI think I think the thing that has
 impressed me most about the developments in AI is the speed it's that things atleast in the context of deep learning
 and maybe this is about to slow down but things moved a lot faster thananticipated the transition from solving
 solving chess to solving go was I mean that's the world rain how quickly itwent the move from alphago to alpha 0 is
 sort of bewildering the speed at which they accomplish thatnow clearly there they're eight so there
 are many problems that you can solve that way but there's some problemfor which who needs something else


Speaker 0 :something like a reasoning where


Speaker 1 :reasoning and also you know that one of
 the real mysteries psychologist there Gary Marcus who is also a critic of AI Imean he what he points out and I think
 he has a point is that humans learn quickly children don't need millionexamples they need two or three examples
 so clearly there is a fundamental difference and what enables what enablethe machine to to learn quickly what you
 have to build into the machine because it's that you have to build someexpectations or something in the machine
 to make it ready to learn quickly that's that at the moment seems to beunsolved I'm pretty sure that the mind
 is working on it but yeah there if they have solved it I haven't heard yet

Speaker 0 :they're trying to actually them an open
 they are trying to start to get to use neural networks to reason so assembleknowledge of course causality is
 temporal causality is out of reach to most everybody you mentioned thebenefits of system one is essentially
 that it's fast allows us to function in

Speaker 1 :the world now some skilled you know its
 skill and it has a model of the world you know in a sense I mean there was theearlier phase of a I attempted to moral
 reasoning and they were moderately successful but you know reasoning byitself doesn't get you much deep
 learning has been much more successful in terms of you know what they can dobut now it's an interesting question
 whether its approaching its limits what

Speaker 0 :do you think I think absolutely so I
 just talked to John laocoon he mentioned you know I know him so he thinks thatthe limits were
 not going to hit the limits with you all networks that ultimately this kind ofsystem on pattern matching will start to
 start to look like system two with without significant transformation ofthe architecture so I'm more with the
 but the majority of the people who think that yes new all networks will hit a

Speaker 1 :limit in their capability he on the one
 hand I have heard him tell the missus obvious essentially that you know whatthey have accomplished it's not a big
 deal that they have just touched that basically you know they can't dounsupervised learning in in an effective
 way and but you're telling me that he thinks that the current within thecurrent architecture you can do
 causality and reasoning so he's very

Speaker 0 :much a pragmatist in a sense that saying
 that were very far away that they're still yeah I think there's this ideathat he says is uh we can only see one
 or two mountain peaks ahead and there might be either a few more after orthousands more after yeah so that kind


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :of idea right but nevertheless it
 doesn't see a the final answer not fundamentally looking like one that wecurrently have
 so neural networks being a huge part

Speaker 1 :that you know I mean that's very likely
 because because pattern matching is so much of what's going on and you can

Speaker 0 :think of neural networks as processing
 information sequentially yeah I mean you

Speaker 1 :know there is there is an important
 aspect to for example you get systems that translate and they do a very goodjob but they really don't know what
 they're talking about and and and for that I'm really quite surprised for thatyou would need you would need an AI that
 has sensation an AI that is in touch with the world awareness and maybe even

Speaker 0 :something resembles consciousness kind


Speaker 1 :of ideas li awareness of you know
 awareness of what's going on so that the the words have meaning who canget are in touch with some perception or


Speaker 0 :some action yeah so that's a big thing
 for yarn and as well here first is grounding to the physical space so so

Speaker 1 :that's what we're talking about the same


Speaker 0 :yeah so but so how you ground I mean the


Speaker 1 :grounding without grounding then you get
 you get a machine that doesn't know what it's talking about because it is talkingabout the world ultimately the question


Speaker 0 :open question is what it means to ground
 I mean we're very human centric in our thinking but what does it mean for amachine to understand what it means to
 be in this world does it need to have a body does he need to have a finitenesslike we humans have all of these
 elements it's very nice to know I'm you

Speaker 1 :know I'm not sure about having a body
 but having a perceptual system having a body would be very helpful to me if ifyou think about human mimicking human
 ooh but having a perception that seems to be central so that you can build youcan accumulate knowledge about the world
 so if you can you can imagine a human completely paralyzed and there's a lotthat the human brain could learn you
 know with a paralyzed body so if we got a machine that could do that it would be

Speaker 0 :a big deal and then the flip side of
 that something you see in children and something in machine learning world iscalled active learning maybe it is is
 being able to play with the world how important for developing system ownersor system to do you think it is to play
 with the world be able to interact with

Speaker 1 :me a lot a lot of what you learn as you
 learn to anticipate the outcomes of your actions I mean you can see that howbabies learn it you know with their
 hands they are they learn you know to connect you know the movement so theirhands with something that clearly is
 something that happens in the brain and and and the ability ofthe brain to learn new patterns so you
 know it's the kind of thing that you get with artificial limbs that you connectit and then people learn to operate the
 artificial limb you know really impressively quickly at least from fromwhat I hear so and we have a system that
 is ready to learn the world's reaction

Speaker 0 :at the risk of going into way too
 mysterious of land what do you think it takes to build a system like thatobviously we're very far from
 understanding how the brain works but how difficult is it to build this mind

Speaker 1 :of ours you know I mean I think that
 yonder Coons answer that we don't know how many mountains there are I thinkthat's a very good answer I think that
 you know if you if you look at what cool Ray Kurzweil is saying that strikes meas of the war but but I think people are
 much more realistic than that were actually they Mesa sabe is and Yanis andso the people are actually doing the
 work fairly realistic I think - maybe

Speaker 0 :phrase it another way from a perspective
 not of building it but from understanding it how complicated arehuman beings in the following sense you
 know I work with autonomous vehicles and pedestrians so we tried to modelpedestrians how difficult is it to model
 a human being their perception of the world the two systems they operate undersufficiently to be able to predict
 whether the pedestrians gonna cross the

Speaker 1 :road or not I'm you know I'm fairly
 optimistic about that actually because what we're talking about is a hugeamount of information that every vehicle
 has and that feeds into one system into one gigantic system and so anything thatany vehicle learns becomes part of what
 the whole system knows and with a sister multiplier like thatthere is a lot that you can do so human
 beings are very complicated but and and you know system is going to makemistakes but human makes mistakes I
 think that they'll be able to I think they are able to anticipate pedestriansotherwise a lot would happen they're
 able to you know they're able to get into a roundabout and into the end totraffic so they must know both to expect
 though to anticipate how people will react when they're sneaking in andthere's a lot of learning that's
 involved in that currently the

Speaker 0 :pedestrians are treated as things that
 cannot be hid and not treated as agents with whom you interact in a gametheoretic way so I mean it's not it's a
 totally open problem and every time somebody tries to solve it it seems tobe harder than we think and nobody's
 really tried to seriously solve the problem of that dance because I'm notsure if you've thought about the problem
 of pedestrians but you're really putting your life in the hands of the driver you

Speaker 1 :know there is a dance as part of the
 dance that would be quite complicated but forexample when I cross the street and
 there is vehicle approaching I look the driver in the eye and I think manypeople do that
 and you know that's a signal that that I'm sending and I would be sending thatmachine to an autonomous vehicle and it
 had better understand it because it

Speaker 0 :means I'm crossing so and there's
 another thing you do that actually so I'll tell you what you do because wewatch I've watched hundreds of hours of
 video on this is when you step in the street you do that before you step onthe street and when you step in the
 street you actually look awake away yeah

Speaker 1 :yeah now what what is it what the saying


Speaker 0 :is mean you're trusting that the car who
 hasn't slowed down yet will slow down

Speaker 1 :and you're telling him yeah I'm
 committed yeah I mean this is like in a game of chicken so I'm committed and ifI'm committed I'm looking away so there
 is you you just have to stop so the

Speaker 0 :question is whether a machine that
 observes that needs to understand

Speaker 1 :mortality here I'm not sure that it's
 got to understand so much it's got to anticipate so and here but you knowyou're surprising me because here I
 would think that maybe you can anticipate without understanding becauseI think this is clearly what's happening
 in playing go or in playing trace there's a lot of anticipation and thereis zero understanding so I thought that
 you didn't need a model of the human yes and the model of the human mind to avoidhitting pedestrians but you are
 suggesting that I do yeah you do as and

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :then it's then it's a lot harder so this


Speaker 0 :is all and I have a follow-up question
 to see where your intuition lies is it seems that almost every robot humancollaboration system is a lot harder
 than people realize so do you think it's possible for robots and humans tocollaborate successfully if we talked a
 little bit about semi autonomous vehicles like in the Tesla autopilot butjust in tasks in general if you think we
 talked about current you'll know where it's being kind of system one do youthink those same systems can borrow
 humans for system to type tasks and collaborate successfully well I think

Speaker 1 :that in any system where humans and the
 Machine interact that the human will be superfluous within a fairly short timeand that is if the Machine has advanced
 enough so that it can really help the human then it may not need the human fora long
 now it would be very interesting if if there are problems that for some reasonthe machine doesn't you're not so but
 that people could solve then you would have to build into the machine andability to recognize that it is in that
 kind of problematic situation and and to call the human that that cannot be easywithout understanding that is its it
 must be very difficult to to program a recognition that you are in aproblematic situation without
 understanding the problem but that's

Speaker 0 :very true in order to understand the
 full scope of situations that are problematic you almost need to be smart

Speaker 1 :enough to solve all those problems it's
 not clear to me how much the machine will need the human I think the exampleof chess is very instructive I mean
 there was a time at which Kasparov was saying that human machine combinationswill beat everybody even stockfish
 doesn't need people yeah and alpha zero certainly doesn't need people the

Speaker 0 :question is just like you said how many
 problems are like chess and how many problems are the ones where are not likechess where even well every problem
 probably in the end is like chess the question is how long is that transition

Speaker 1 :period I mean you know that that's a
 question I would ask you in terms of men autonomous vehicle just driving isprobably a lot more complicated than go
 to solve that yes and that's surprising

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :because it's open no I mean you know I
 couldn't that's not surprising to me because the because that there is ahierarchical aspect to this which is
 recognizing a situation and then within the situation bringing bringing up therelevant knowledge and and for that
 hierarchical type of system to work you need a more complicated system

Speaker 0 :currently a lot of people think because
 as human beings this is probably the the cognitive biases they think of drivingis pretty simple because they think of
 their own experience this is actually a big problem for aai researchers orpeople thinking about AI because they
 evaluate how hard a particular problem is based on very limited knowledge butbasically how hard it is for them to do
 the task yeah and then they take for granted I mean maybe you can speak tothat because most people tell me driving
 is trivial and and humans in fact are terrible at driving is what people tellme and I see humans and humans are
 actually incredible at driving and driving is really terribly difficultyeah so is that just another element of
 the effects that you've described in

Speaker 1 :your work on the psychology side oh no I
 mean I haven't really you know I I would say that my research has contributednothing to understanding the ecology
 into understanding the structure of situations yeah and the complexity ofproblems so all all we know is very
 clear that that go it's endlessly complicated but it's very constrained soand in the real world there are far
 fewer constraints and and many more potential surprises so so that's

Speaker 0 :obviously because it's not always
 obvious to people right so when you think about well I mean you know people

Speaker 1 :thought that reasoning was hard and
 perceiving was easy but you know they quickly learned that actually modelingvision was tremendously complicated and
 modelling even proving theorems was relatively straightforward to push back

Speaker 0 :in and out a little bit on the quickly
 part they haven't it took several decades to learn that and most peoplestill haven't learned that I mean our
 intuition of course AI researchers have but you drift a little bit outsidethe specific a I feel the intuition is
 still perceptible yes all no I mean

Speaker 1 :that's true I mean intuitions the
 intuitions of the public haven't changed radically and they are there as you saidthey're evaluating the complexity of
 problems by how difficult it is for them to solve the problems and that's gotvery little to do with the complexities
 of solving them in AI how do you think

Speaker 0 :from the perspective of AI researcher do
 we deal with the intuitions of the public so in trying to think me arguablythe combination of hype investment and
 the public intuition is what led to the AI winters I'm sure that same can beapplied to tech or that the intuition of
 the public leads to media hype these two companies investing in the tech and thenthe text doesn't make the company's
 money and then there's a crash is there a way to educate people is there tofight the let's call it system 1


Speaker 1 :thinking in general no I think that's
 the simple answer and it's going to take a long time before the understanding ofwhere those systems can do becomes you
 know button becomes public knowledge I and and then and the expectations youknow there are several aspects that are
 going to be very complicated that the the fact that you have a device thatcannot explain itself is a major major
 difficulty and and we're already seeing that I mean this is this is reallysomething that is happening so it's
 happening in the judicial system so you haveyou have system that are clearly better
 at predicting parole violations then than judges but but they can't explaintheir reasoning and so people don't want


Speaker 0 :to trust them we are seem to you in
 system one even use cues to make judgments about our environment so thisexplain ability point do you think


Speaker 1 :humans can explain stuff no but so I
 mean there is a very interesting aspect of that humans think they can explainthemselves right so when you say
 something and I ask you why do you believe that then reasons will occur toyou and you were but actually my own
 belief is that in most cases the reasons are very little to do with why youbelieve what you believe so that the
 reasons are a story that that comes to your mind when you need to explainyourself
 but but but people traffic in those explanations I mean the humaninteraction depends on those shared
 fictions and and the stories that people tell themselves you just made me

Speaker 0 :actually realize and we'll talk about
 stories in a second that not to be cynical about it but perhaps there's awhole movement of people trying to do
 explainable AI and really we don't necessarily need to explain hey I justneed to explain itself it just needs to
 tell a convincing story yeah it doesn't missus the story doesn't necessarilyneed to reflect the truth is it just
 needs to be convincing there's something

Speaker 1 :you can say exactly the same thing in a
 way that's sound cynical abysm sounds in a grave and so but but the objectivebrilliant of having an explanation is is
 to tell a story that would be acceptable to people and andand for it to be acceptable and to be a
 robustly acceptable it has to have some elements of truth but but the objectiveis for people to accept it it's quite


Speaker 0 :brilliant actually but so on the and the
 stories that we tell sorry to ask me to ask you the question that most peopleknow the answer to but you talk about
 two cells in terms of how life has lived the experience self and remembering selfand you describe the distinction between


Speaker 1 :the two well sure I mean the there is an
 aspect of of life that occasionally you know most of the time we just live andweb experiences and they're better and
 they are worse and it goes on over time and mostly we forget everything happenswe forget most of what happens then
 occasionally you when something ends or different points you evaluate the pastand you form a memory and the memory is
 schematic it's not that you can roll a film of an interaction you construct ineffect the elements of a story about it
 about an episode so there is the experience and there is a story that iscreated about the experience and that's
 what I call the remember II so I had the image of two selves so there is a selfthat lives and there is a self that
 evaluates life now the paradox and the deep paradox in that is that we have onesystem or one self that does the living
 but the other system the remembering self is all we get to keep and basicallydecision-making and and everything that
 we do is governed by our memories not by what actually happened it's it'sgoverned by by the story that we told
 ourselves or by the story that we're keeping so that that's the distinction I

Speaker 0 :mean there's a lot of
 ideas about the pursuit of happiness that come out of that what are theproperties of happiness which emerge


Speaker 1 :from yourself there are there are
 properties of how we construct stories that are really important so that Istudied a few but but a couple are
 really very striking and one is that in stories time doesn't matter there's asequence of events so there are
 highlight those not and and how long it took you know they lived happily everafter
 and three years later something it time really doesn't matter and in storiesevents matter but time doesn't that that
 leads to a very interesting set of problems because time is all we got tolive I mean you know time is the
 currency of life and yet time is not represented basically in evaluativememories so that that creates a lot of
 paradoxes that I've thought about yeah

Speaker 0 :they're fascinating but if you were to
 [Music] give advice on how one lives a happylife
 well this and such properties what's the

Speaker 1 :optimal you know I give up I abandoned
 happiness research because I couldn't solve that problem I couldn't I couldn'tsee and in the first place it's very
 clear that if you do talk in terms of those two selves then that what makesthe remembering self happy and what
 makes the experiencing self happy are different things and I I asked thequestion of suppose you're planning a
 vacation and you're just told that at the end of the vacation you'll get anamnesic drugs who remember nothing and
 they'll also destroy your your photos so there'll be nothing would you still goto the same vacation
 and and it's it turns out we go to vacations in large part to constructmemories not to have experiences but to
 construct memories and it turns out that the vacation that you would want foryourself if you knew you would not
 remember is probably not the same vacation that you will want for yourselfif you will remember so I have no
 solution to these problems but clearly those are big issues and you've thought

Speaker 0 :about issues you've talked about sort of
 how many minutes or hours you spend about the vacation it's an interestingway to think about it because that's how
 you really experience the vacation outside the being in it but there's alsoa modern I don't know if you think about
 this or interact with it there's a modern way to magnify the rememberingself which is by posting an Instagram on
 Twitter on social networks a lot of people live life for the picture thatyou take that you post somewhere and now
 thousands of people sharing and potentially petitioning millions andthen you can relive it even much more
 than just those minutes do you think about that i magnification much you know

Speaker 1 :I'm too old for social networks I you
 know I've never seen Instagram so I cannot really speak intelligently aboutthose things I'm just too old but it's


Speaker 0 :interesting to watch the exact times you


Speaker 1 :describe I make a very big difference I
 mean and it will make it will also make a difference and that I don't knowwhether it's clear that in some ways
 the devices that serve us supplants function so you don't have to rememberphone numbers you don't have you really
 don't have to know facts I mean the number of conversations I'm involvedwith when somebody says well let's look
 it up so it's it's in a way it's made conversations well it's it means thatit's much less important to know things
 you know it used to be very important to know things this is changing so therequirements of that that we have for
 ourselves and for other people are changing because of all those supportsand because and I have no idea but
 Instagram does connected so well I'll

Speaker 0 :tell you train you I mean I wish I could
 just have the my remembering self could enjoy this conversation but I'll get toenjoy it even more by having watched by
 watching it and then talking to others will be about a hundred thousand peoplescary's is this to say well listen or
 watch this right it changes things it changes the experience of the worldthat you seek out experiences which
 could be shared in that way it's in and I haven't seen it's it's the sameeffects that you described and I don't
 think the psychology of that magnification has been described yetbecause in your world


Speaker 1 :the sharing then was appear there was a
 time when people read books and you could assume that your friends had readthe same books that you read so there


Speaker 0 :was kind of invisible sharing a year it


Speaker 1 :was a lot of sharing going on and there
 was a lot of assumed common knowledge and you know that was built in I mean itwas obvious that you had read the New
 York Times it was obvious that you'd read the reviews I mean so a lot wastaken for granted that was shared
 and you know when they were when there were three television channels it wasobvious that you'd seen one of them
 probably the same so sharing sharing he's always been always was always thereit was just different at the risk of


Speaker 0 :inviting mockery from you let me say
 there that I'm also a fan of Sartre and Camus and existentialist philosophersand I'm joking of course about mockery
 but from the perspective of the two selves what do you think of theexistentialist philosophy of life so
 trying to really emphasize the experiencing self as the proper way toor the best way to live life I don't


Speaker 1 :know enough philosophy to and so that
 but it's not a you know the emphasis on an experience is also the emphasis inBuddhism right it's so that you just
 have got to to experience things and and and not to evaluate and not to passjudgment and not to score not to keep
 score so if when you look at the the

Speaker 0 :grand picture of experience you think
 there's something to that that one one of the ways to achieve contentment andmaybe even happiness is letting go of
 any of the things any of the procedures

Speaker 1 :of the remembering self well yeah I mean
 I think you know if one could imagine a life in which people don't scorethemselves it it feels as if that would
 be a better life as if the self scoring and you know how am i doing a kind ofquestion is not is not a very happy
 thing to have but I got out of that field because I couldn't solve that andand that was because my intuition was
 that the experiencing self that's reality but then it turns out that whatpeople want for themselves
 there's not experience that they want memories and they want a good storyabout their life and so you cannot have
 a theory of happiness that doesn't correspond to what people want forthemselves and when I when I realized
 that this this was where things were going I really sort of left the field ofresearch do you think there's something


Speaker 0 :instructive about this emphasis of
 reliving memories in building AI systems so currently artificial intelligencesystems are more like experiencing self
 in that they react to the environment there's some pattern formation likelearning so on but you really don't
 construct memories except in reinforcement learning everyone swatheryou replay over and over yeah but you


Speaker 1 :know that would in principle would not


Speaker 0 :be you know yes useful do you think it's
 a feature a bug of human beings that we that we look back oh I think that's

Speaker 1 :definitely a feature that's not a bug I
 mean you you have to look back in order to look forward so without withoutlooking back you couldn't you couldn't
 really intelligently look forward you're

Speaker 0 :looking for the echoes of the same kind
 of experience in order to predict what the future holds yeah though ViktorFrankl in his book man's search for
 meaning I'm not sure if you've read describes his experience at theconsecration a concentration camps
 during World War two as a way to describe that finding identifying apurpose in life a positive purpose in
 life can say one from suffering first of all do you connect with the philosophy

Speaker 1 :they he describes they're not really I
 mean the so I can I can really see that somebody who has that feeling ofper person meaning and so on that that
 could sustain you I in general don't have that feeling and I'm pretty surethat if I were in a concentration camp
 and give up and die you know so he talks he is he's a survivor yeah and you knowhe survived with that and I'm and I'm
 not sure how I central to survival the same years yeah I do know when I thinkabout myself that I would have given up
 at oh yeah this isn't going anywhere and there is there is a sort of characterthat that that manages to survive in
 conditions like that and then because they survive they tell stories and itsounds as if they survived because of
 what they were doing we have no idea they survived because the kind of peoplethat they are and the other kind of
 people survives them to tell them such stories of a particular guy so I'm not

Speaker 0 :so that you don't think seeking purpose
 is a significant driver and are the

Speaker 1 :units it's a very interesting question
 because when you ask people whether it's very important to add meaning in theirlife that's oh yes that's the most
 important thing but when you ask people what kind of a day did you have and andyou know what were the experiences that
 you remember you don't get much meaning you get social experiences then and andsome people say that for example in in
 in child you know in taking care of children the fact that they're yourchildren and you're taking care of them
 makes a very big difference I think that's entirely true but it's morebecause the story that we are telling
 ourselves which is a very different story when we're taking care of ourchildren or when we're taking here other


Speaker 0 :thing jumping around a little bit in
 doing a lot of experiments let me ask a questionmost of the work I do for example is in
 the wall in the real world but most of the clean good-sized that you can do isin the lab so that distinction do you
 think we can understand the fundamentals of human behavior through controlledexperiments in the lab if we talk about
 pupil diameter for example it's much easier to do when you can controllighting conditions yeah thanks
 so when we look at driving lighting variation destroys yeah absolutely yourability to use pupil diameter but in the
 lab for as I mentioned semi autonomous autonomous vehicles in drivingsimulators we can't we don't capture
 true honest human behavior in that particular domain so your what's yourintuition how much of human behavior can
 we study in this controlled environment of the lab a lot but you'd have to

Speaker 1 :verify it you know that you'll your
 conclusions are basically limited to the situation to the experimental situationthen you have to jump the big inductive
 leap to the real world so and and that's the Flair that's where the difference Ithink between the good psychologist and
 others of the mediocre is in the sense of that your experiment capturessomething that's important and something
 that's real and others are just running

Speaker 0 :experiments so what is that like the
 birth of an idea to his development in your mind to something that leads to anexperiment is that similar to maybe like
 what I Steiner good physicists do is your intuition you basically use yourintuition to build up but I mean you


Speaker 1 :know it's it's very skilled intuition
 right I mean I just had that experience actually I had an idea that's turned outto be very good idea
 a couple of days ago and and you and you have a sense of that building up so I'mworking with a collaborator and he
 essentially was saying you know what what are you doing what's what's goingon and I was I really I couldn't exactly
 explain it but I knew this is going somewhere but you know I've been aroundthat game for a very long time and so I
 can you you develop that anticipation that yes this this is worth followingnow that he's here that's part of the


Speaker 0 :skill is that something you can reduce
 two words in describing a process in in the form of advice to others know follow

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :your heart essentially you know it's


Speaker 1 :it's like trying to explain what it's
 like to drive it's not you've got to break it apart and it's not and then youlose and then you lose the experience


Speaker 0 :them you mentioned collaboration you've
 written about your collaboration with Amos Tversky that this is you writingthe twelve or thirteen years in which
 most of our work was joint four years of interpersonal and intellectual blisseverything was interesting almost
 everything was funny and that was a current joy of seeing anidea take shape so many times in those
 years we shared the magical experience of one of us saying something which theother one would understand more deeply
 than a speaker had done contrary to the old laws of information theory it wascommon for us to find that more
 information was received than had been sentI have almost never had the experience
 with anyone else if you have not had it you don't know how marvelouscollaboration can be so let me ask a
 bird perhaps a silly question how does one find in create such a collaborationthat may be asking like how does one


Speaker 1 :find love but yeah yeah to be you have
 to be lucky and and I think you have to have the character for that because I'vehad many collaborate
 I mean none worth as exciting as with almost be but Fahad and I'm having itwas very so it's a skill I think I'm
 good at it not everybody is good at it and thenit's the luck of finding people who are
 also good at it is there advice in a

Speaker 0 :forum for a young scientist who also
 seeks to violate this law of information

Speaker 1 :dairy
 I really think it's so much luck is involved and you know in in those reallyserious collaborations at least in my
 experience are a very personal experience and and I have to like theperson I'm working with otherwise you
 know I mean there is that kind of collaboration which is like an exchangea commercial exchange of giving this you
 give me that but the the real ones are interpersonal they're between peoplelike each other and and who like making
 each other think and who like the way that the other person responds to yourthoughts you have to be lucky yeah I


Speaker 0 :mean but I already noticed if I even
 just me showing up here evil you've quickly started to digging in aparticular problem I'm working on and
 already new information started to emerge is that a process you just theprocess of curiosity of talking to
 people about problems and seeing I'm

Speaker 1 :curious about anything to do with AI and
 robotics and on so and I knew that you were dealing with that so it was curious

Speaker 0 :just follow your curiosity jumping
 around and a psychology front the dramatic sounding terminology ofreplication crisis but really just the
 at times this this effect at a time studies do not are not fullygeneralizable they don't you have being


Speaker 1 :polite is it so I'm actually not fully


Speaker 0 :familiar well the memory how bad it is
 right so what do you think is the source

Speaker 1 :where do you think I think I know what's
 going on actually I mean I have a theory about what's going on and what's goingon is that there is first of all a very
 important distinction between two types of experimentsand one type is within subject so it's
 the same person has two experimental conditions and the other type is betweensubjects where some people have this
 condition are the people in that condition they're different world andbetween subject experiments are much
 harder to predict and much harder to anticipate and the reason and they'realso more expensive because you need
 more people and it's just so between subject experiments is where the problemis it's not so much and within subject
 experiments it's really between and there is a very good reason why theintuitions of researchers about between
 subject experiments are wrong and that's because when you are a researcher you'rein a within subject situation and it is
 you are imagining the two conditions and you see the causality and you feel itand but in the between subjects
 condition they don't like they see they live in one condition and the other oneis just nowhere
 so our intuitions are very weak about between subject experiments and that Ithink is something that people haven't
 realized and and in addition because of that we have no idea about the power ofmanipulations of experimental
 manipulations because the same manipulation it's much more powerfulwhen when you are in the two conditions
 then when you live in only one condition and so the experimenters have very poorintuitions about between subject
 experiments and and there is something else which is very important I thinkwhich is that almost all psychological
 hypotheses are true that is in the sense that you know directionally if you havea hypothesis that
 a really causes B that that it's not true that is causes the opposite of Bmaybe a just and very little effect but
 hypotheses are true mostly except mostly they're very weakthey're much weaker than you think when
 you are having images of so the reason I'm excited about that is that Irecently heard about some some friends
 of mine who they essentially funded 53 studies of behavioral change by 20different teams of people with a very
 precise objective of changing the number of time that people go to the gym butyou know and and the success rate was
 zero the knocks one of the 53 studies work now what's interesting about thatis those are the best people in the
 field and they have no idea what's going on so they are not calibrated they thinkthat it's going to be powerful because
 they can imagine it but actually it's just weak because the and you arefocusing on on your manipulation and it
 feels powerful to you there's a thing that I've written about that's calledthe focusing illusion that is that when
 you think about something it looks very important more important than it really

Speaker 0 :is more important than it really is but
 if you don't see that effect the 53 studies doesn't I mean you just reportthat so what was I guess the solution to
 that

Speaker 1 :well I mean the the solution is for
 people to trust their intuitions less all to try out their intuitions before Imean experiments have to be
 pre-registered and by the time you run an experiment you have to be committedto it and you have to run the experiment
 seriously enough and in a public and so this is happeningand the interesting thing is what what
 happens before and how do people prepare themselves and how they run pilotexperiments it's going to train the way
 psychologies done and it's already happening

Speaker 0 :do you ever hope for as my connect to
 the this study sample size yeah I do ever hope for the internet or do you

Speaker 1 :know this is really happening
 MTurk yeah everybody is running experiments on him to look and and it'svery cheap and very effective do you


Speaker 0 :think that changes psychology
 essentially because you're think you can

Speaker 1 :object it then truly it will I mean I
 you know I can't put my finger on how exactly but it that's been true inpsychology with whenever an important
 new method came in it changes the feel so and an M torque is really a methodbecause exact it makes it very much
 easier to do something to do some things

Speaker 0 :is there are undergrad students will ask
 me you know how big a neural network should be for a particular problem solet me ask you an equivalent equivalent
 question how big how many subjects they study have for it to have a conclusive

Speaker 1 :result well depends on the strength of
 the effect so if you're studying visual perception the perception of color manyother are the classic results in in
 visual in color perception we've done on three or four people and I think and oneof them was called a blind but or they'd
 partly colorblind but on vision you know you belong many people don't need a lotof replications for some type of
 neurological experiment neuro when you're studying weaker phenomenaand especially when you're studying them
 between subjects then you need a lot more subjects than people have beenrunning and that is that's one of the
 things that are happening in psychology now is that the power is a statisticalpower the experiment is increasing


Speaker 0 :rapidly does that between subjects as
 the number of subjects goes to infinity

Speaker 1 :approach well I mean you know goes to
 infinity is exaggerated but people the standard number of subjects for anexperiment psychology with 30 or 40 and
 for a weak effect that's simply not enough and you may need a couple ofhundred I mean it's that that sort of
 order of magnitude what are the major

Speaker 0 :disagreements in theories and effects
 that you've observed throughout your careerthat's the stand today well you work on


Speaker 1 :several fields yeah but what still is


Speaker 0 :out there as major disagreement offs in


Speaker 1 :your mind and I've had one extreme
 experience of you know controversy with somebody who really doesn't like thework that they must risky and I did and
 he's been after us for 30 years or more

Speaker 0 :at least when I talk about it well I


Speaker 1 :mean his name is good Giga answer he's a
 well-known German psychologist and that's the one controversy I have whichI it's been unpleasant and no I don't
 particularly want to talk about it but

Speaker 0 :it's there is their open questions even
 in your own mind every once in a while you know we talked about semi autonomousvehicles in my own mind I see what the
 data says but I also constantly torn do you have things where you or yourstudies have found something but you're
 also intellectually torn about what it means and there's been maybedisagreement
 you within your own mind about particularly I mean it's you know one of

Speaker 1 :the things that are interesting is how
 difficult it is for people to change their mind essentially you know oncethey're committed people just don't
 change their mind about anything that matters and that is surprisingly butit's true about scientists so the
 controversy that I described in other it's been going on like thirty years andit's never going to be resolved and you
 build a system and you live within that system and other other systems of ideaslook foreign to you and there is very
 little contact and very little mutual influence that happens a fair amount

Speaker 0 :do you ever hopeful advice or message on
 that we think about science thinking about politics thinking about thingsthat have impact on this world how can
 we change your mind I think that I mean

Speaker 1 :on things that matter or a political or
 a little religious and people just don't don't change their mind and by and largeand there is very little that you can do
 about it the what does happen is that if leaders change their mind so for examplethe public the American public doesn't
 really believe in climate change doesn't take it very seriously but if somereligious leaders decided this is a
 major threat to humanity that would have a big effect so that wewe have the opinions that we have not
 because we know why we have them but because we trust some people and wedon't trust other people and so it's
 much less about evidence than it is about stories so the way one way to

Speaker 0 :change your mind isn't at the individual
 level is that the leaders of the communities you look up with the storieschange
 and therefore your mind changes with them so there's a guy named Alan Turingcame up with a touring test yeah
 what what do you think is a good test of intelligence perhaps we're drifting in atopic that were maybe philosophizing
 about but what do you think is a good test for intelligence for an artificialintelligence system well the standard


Speaker 1 :definition of you know official general
 intelligence is that it can do anything that people can do and it can do thembetter yes what what we are seeing is
 that in many domains you have domain-specific and you know devices orprograms or software and they beat
 people easily in specified way but we are very far from is either generallyability a general-purpose intelligence
 so we in in machine learning people are approaching something more general Imean for alpha 0 ISM was much more
 general than than alphago and but it's still extraordinarily narrow andspecific in what it can do so we're
 quite far from from something that can in every domain think like a human

Speaker 0 :except better what aspects of the Turing
 test has been criticized its natural language conversation you know that it'stoo simplistic guys it's easy to quote
 unquote pass under under constraints specified it what aspect of conversationwould impress you if you heard it is it
 humor is it what what would impress the

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :heck out of you if if you saw it in
 conversation yeah I mean suddenly wit would yeah which would be impressive andand humor would be more impressive than
 just factual conversation which i think is is easy and illusions would beinteresting and metaphors would be
 interesting I mean but new metaphors not practice metaphors so there's a lot thatyou know would be sort of impressive and
 that it's completely natural in conversation but that you reallywouldn't expect there's the possibility


Speaker 0 :of creating and a human level
 intelligence or super human level intelligence system excite you scare you

Speaker 1 :well I mean how does it make you feel I
 find the whole thing fascinating absolutely fascinating exciting I thinkand exciting it's also terrifying you
 know but but I'm not going to be around to see it and so I'm curious about whatis happening now but I also know that
 that predictions about it are silly we really have no idea but it will looklike 30 years from now
 no idea speaking of silly bordering and

Speaker 0 :the profound they may ask the question
 of in your view what is the meaning of it all the meaning of lifehe's a descendant of great apes that we
 are why what drives us as a civilization as a human being as a force behindeverything that you've observed and
 studied is there any answer or is it all just a beautiful mess there is no answer

Speaker 1 :that that I can understand and I'm not
 and I'm not actively looking for one do

Speaker 0 :you think an answer exists no there is


Speaker 1 :no answer that we can understand I'm not
 qualified to speak about what we cannot understand but there is I know that wecannot understand reality you know
 and I mean there's other thing that we can do I mean you know gravity waves andthat's a big moment for Humanity and
 when you imagine that eeep you know being able to to go back to the Big Bangthat's that but but the y-yeah the
 warrior than us the why is hopeless really day thank you
