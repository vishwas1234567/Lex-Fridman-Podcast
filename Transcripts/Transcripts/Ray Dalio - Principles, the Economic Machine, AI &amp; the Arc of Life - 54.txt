Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with Ray
 Dalio he's the founder co-chairman and Co chief investment officer ofBridgewater associates one of the
 world's largest and most successful investment firms that is famous for theprinciples of radical truth and


Speaker 0 :transparency that underlies culture Ray


Speaker 1 :is one of the wealthiest people in the
 world with ideas that extend far beyond the specifics of how he made that wealthhis ideas that are applicable to
 everyone are brilliantly summarized in his book principles there are also evenfurther condensed on several other
 platforms including YouTube where for example the 30 minute video titled howthe economic machine works is one of the
 best educational videos I personally have ever seen on YouTube once again youmay have noticed that the people I've
 been speaking with are not just computer scientists but philosophersmathematicians writers psychologists
 physicists economists investors and soon

Speaker 0 :much more to me AI is much bigger than


Speaker 1 :deep learning bigger than computing it
 is our civilizations journey into understanding the human mind andcreating echoes of it in the machine
 that journey includes the mechanisms of our economy of our politics and the

Speaker 0 :leaders that shape the future of both

 better world and now here's my

Speaker 0 :conversation with Ray Dalio


Speaker 1 :truth or more precisely an accurate
 understanding of reality is the essential foundation of any good outcomeI believe you've said that let me ask an
 absurd sounding question at the - South Col level so what is truth when you'retrying to do something different than
 everybody else is doing and perhaps something that has not been done beforehow do you accurately analyze the
 situation how do you accurately discover the truth the nature of things almost

Speaker 0 :the way you're asking the question
 implies that truth and newness have nothing or almost at odds and I justwant to say that I don't think that
 that's true right so what I mean by truth truth is you know was a realityhow does the reality work and so if
 you're doing something new that has never been done before which is excitingand I like to do the way that you would
 start with that is experimenting on what are the realities and the premises thatyou're using on that and how to stress
 test those types of things I think what you're talking about is instead the factof how do you deal with something that's
 never been done before and deal with the Associated probabilities and so I Ithink in that don't let something that's
 never been done before stand in the way of you doing that particular thing youhave a because almost the only way that
 you understand what truth is is through experimentation and so when you go outand experiment you're going to learn a
 lot more about what truth is but the essence of what I'm saying is that whenyou take a look at that use truth that
 find out what the realities are as a foundation do the independent thinkingdo the experimentation to find out
 what's true and change and keep going after that so I think that the way thatwhen you're thinking about it the way
 you're thinking about it that almost implies that you're you're lettingpeople almost say that they're reliant
 on what's been discovered before to find out what's true and what's beendiscovered before is often not true
 right conventional view of what what is true is very often wrong it'll go in upsand downs and you know I mean there are
 fads and okay this thing it goes this way and that way and so definitions oftruths that are conventional are not the


Speaker 1 :thing to go by how do you know the thing
 that has been done before it might

Speaker 0 :succeed its to do you whatever homework
 that you have in order to try to get a foundation and then to go into worlds ofnot knowing and you go into the world of
 not knowing but not stupidly not naively you know you go into that world of notknowing and then you do experimenting
 and you learn what truth is and what's possible through that process I describeit as a five step process the first step
 is you go after your goals the second step is you identify the problems thatstand in the way of you getting to your
 goals the third step is you diagnose those to get at the root cause of thosethen the fourth step is then now that
 you know the exact truth calls you get you design a way to get around those andthen you follow through and do the
 designs you set out to do and it's the experimentation I think that whathappens to people mostly is that they
 try to decide whether they're going to be successful or notahead of doing it and they don't know
 how to do the process well because the nature of your questions are along thoselines like how do you know well you
 don't know but a practical person who is also used to making dreams happen knowshow to do that process I've given
 personality tests to shapers so the person what I mean by a shaper is aperson who can take something from
 visual as visualization they have an audacious goal and then they go fromvisualization to actualization building
 it out that includes Elon Musk I gave him the personality tests I'm giving itto Bill Gates and give it to many many
 such shapers and they know that process that I'm talking about they experienceit which is a process essentially of
 knowing how to go from an audacious but not in a ridiculous way not a dreamand then to do that learning along the
 way that allows them in a very practical way to learn very rapidly as they're

Speaker 1 :moving toward that goal so the the call
 to adventure the adventure starts not trying to analyze the probabilities ofthe situation but using what instinct
 how do you dive in so let's talk what it

Speaker 0 :is it is being a it's simultaneously
 being a dreamer and a realist it's to know how to do that well the pole comesfrom a pole to adventure for whatever
 reason I can't tell you how much of its genetics and how much its environmentbut there's a early on it's exciting
 that notion is exciting being creative is exciting and so one feels that thenone gets in the habit of doing that okay
 how do I know how do I learn very well and then how do I imagine and then howdo I experiment to go from that
 imagination so it's that process that one and then one more one does it theone more the better one becomes that you


Speaker 1 :mentioned shapers you know musk Bill
 Gates what who are the shapers do you find yourself thinking about when you'reconstructing these ideas the ones that
 define the archetype of a shaper for you

Speaker 0 :well as I say a shaper for me is
 somebody who comes up with a great visualization usually a really uniquevisualization and then actually builds
 it out and makes the world different changes the world in that kind of a wayso when I look at it Marc Benioff with
 Salesforce Chris Anderson with Ted Mohamed Younis with social enterprise inphilanthropy Canada and Harlem
 Children's Zone there are all domains have shapers who have the ability tovisualize and make extraordinary things


Speaker 1 :happen what are the commonalities in


Speaker 0 :some of them the commonalities
 our first of all the excitement of something new that call to adventure andand again that practicality the capacity
 to learn it and the capacity then they're they're able to be in many waysfull rage that means they're able to go
 from the big big picture down to the detail so let's say for example ElonMusk he describes he gets a lot of money
 from selling PayPal his interest in PayPal he said why isn't anybody goingto Mars or out of space what we're gonna
 do if the planet goes to hell and how do i how do we going to get that andnobody's paying attention to that he
 doesn't know much about it he then reads and learns and so on says I'm gonna takeok half of my money and I'm gonna put it
 in there and I'm gonna do this thing and he learns a blood level about and he'sgot creative okay that's one dimension
 and so he and gave me the keys to his car was one just early days into andTesla and he then points out the details
 okay if you push this button here it's this the detail deathso he's simultaneously talking about the
 big the big big big picture okay windows humanity going to abandon the panic buthe will then be able to take it down
 into the detail so he can go let's call it helicoptering he can go up he can godown and see things at those types of
 perspective and they're using it with

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the other shapers and that's a common
 thing that they can do that another important difference that they have inmind is how they deal with people i mean
 meaning there's nothing more important than achieving the mission and so whatthey have in common is that there's a
 test that I give these personality tests because they're very helpful forunderstanding people and so I gave it to
 all these shapers and one of the things in workplace inventory test is this testand it has a category called concern for
 others whatever it's a they were all having concern for others this includesMohan
 Yunis who invented microfinance social enterprise impact investing is MuhammadYunus received the Nobel Peace Prize for
 this Congressional Medal of Honor one of the Fortune determined one of the 10greatest entrepreneurs of our time he's
 built all sorts of businesses to give back money and social enterprise aremarkable man he has nobody that I know
 practically could have more concern for others I'm he lives a life of a saint Imean very modest lifestyle and he puts
 all his money into trying to help others and he tests low on the courts calledconcern for others because what it
 really those the questions under that are questions about conflict to get atthe mission so they all Geoffrey Canada
 change Harlem Children's Zone and developed that to take children inHarlem and get them well taken care of
 not only just in their education but their whole lives harmless in alsoconcern for others what they mean is
 that they can see whether though individuals are performing at a levelthat an extremely high level that's
 necessary to make those dreams happen so when you think of let's say Steve Jobswas famous for being you know difficult
 with people and so on and I don't know Steve Jobs so I can't speak personallyto that but he's comments on Dae players
 and if you have 80 players if you put in B players pretty soon you'll have Cplayers and so on that is a common
 element of them holding people to high standards and not letting anybody standin the way of the the mission what do


Speaker 1 :you think about that kind of idea is
 sorry to pause on that for a second that the a B and C players and the importanceof so when you have a mission to really
 only have a players and be sort of

Speaker 0 :aggressively filtering for that yes but
 I think that there are all different ways of being a players and I think inwhat a great a great team you have to
 appreciate all the differences in ways of being a players ok yes that's thefirst thing and then you always have to
 be super excellent to my opinion you always have to bereally excellent people with people to
 help them understand each other themselves and get in sync with themabout what's true about them and their
 circumstances now they're doing so that they're having a fabulous personaldevelopment experience at the same time
 as you're dealing with them so when I say that they're all different ways thisis one of the than qualities you asked
 me the one of the qualities so one of the third qualities that I would say isto know how to deal well with your not
 knowing and to be able to get the best expertise so that you're a greatOrchestrator of different ways so that
 the people who are really really successful unlike most people believethat they're successful because of what
 they know they're at even more successful by being able to effectivelylearn from others and tapping into the
 skills of people who see things different from them brilliant so how do

Speaker 1 :you when they're that personality being
 first of all open to the fact that there's other people see thingsdifferently than you and at the same
 time have supreme confidence in your vision is there just a psychology ofthat do you see attention there between
 the confidence and the open-mindedness

Speaker 0 :and now it's funny because I think we
 grow up thinking that there's a tension there right that there's a confidenceand and the more confidence that you
 have there's attention with the open-mindedness and not being sure okayconfident and accurate are almost
 negatively correlated many people they're extremely confident and they'reoften inaccurate and so I think one of
 the greatest tragedies of people is not realizing how those things two gotogether because instead it's really
 that by saying I know a lot and how do I know I'm still not wrong and how do Itake that the best thinking of all
 available to me and then raise my probability of learning all these peoplethink for them
 selves okay I mean meaning they're smart but they take in like vacuum cleanersthey take in ideas of others they stress
 test their ideas with others they assess what comes back to them in the form ofother thinking and they also know what
 they're not good at and what other people who are good at the things thatthey're not good at they know how to get
 those people and be successful all around because nobody has enoughknowledge in their heads and that I
 think is one of the great differences Sutton the reason my company has beensuccessful in terms of this is because
 of an idea meritocratic decision-making a process by which you can get the bestideas you know what's an idea
 meritocracy an idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas that are availableout there and to work together with
 other people and the team to achieve

Speaker 1 :that it's an incredible process that you
 describe in several places to arrive at the truth but apologize fromromanticizing the notion blaming linger
 on it just having enough self belief you don't think there's a self delusionthere that's necessary especially in the
 beginning you talk about in the journey maybe the trials or the abyss do youthink there is value to deluding


Speaker 0 :yourself I think what you're calling
 delusion is a bad word yes for uncertainty okay so I mean in otherwords because we keep going back to the
 question how would you know and all of these things know I think that delusionis not going to help you that you have
 to find out truth okay to deal with uncertainty not saying aunt listen Ihave this dream and I don't know how I'm
 going to get that dream I mentioned in my book principles and describe theprocess in a more complete way than
 we're gonna be able to go here but what happens is I say you form your dreamsfirst and you can't judge whether you're
 going to achieve those dreams because you haven't learned the things thatyou're going to learn on the way toward
 those dreams okay so if that isn't delusion I wouldn't usedelusion I think you're over emphasizing
 the importance of knowing whether you're going to succeed or not get rid of thatokay if you can get rid of that and say
 okay no I can have that dream but I'm so realistic in the notion of finding outI'm curious I'm a great learner I'm a
 great experimenter along the way you'll do those experiments which will teachyou more truths and more learning about
 the reality so that you can get your dreams because if you still live in thatworld of delusion okay and you think
 your lusion is helpful no the delusion isn't don't confuse delusion with not

Speaker 1 :knowing yes
 but nevertheless so if we look at the abyss we can look at your own that youdescribe it's difficult psychologically
 for people so in many people quit many people choose a path that is morecomfortable and I mean that the the
 heartbreak of that you know breaks people so if you have the dream and thenthere's this cycle of learning setting a
 goal and so on what's your value for the psychology of just being broken by these

Speaker 0 :difficult moments well that's that
 that's classically the defining moment it's almost like evolution taking careof okay now you're you crash you're in
 the abyss oh my god that's bad and then the question is what do you do and itsorts people okay and that's what that's
 some people get off the field and they say oh I don't like this and so on andsome people learn and they have decay
 and they have a metamorphosis and it changes their approach to learning itthe number one thing it should give them
 is uncertainty you should take an audacious dreaming guy who wants tochange the world crash okay and then
 come out of that crashing and saying okay I can be audacious and scared thatI'm going to be wrong at the same time
 and then how do I do that because that's the key when you don't lose youraudaciousness and you
 going after your big goal and at the same time you say hey I'm worried thatI'm gonna be wrong you gain your radical
 open-mindedness that allows you to take in the things that allows you to go tothe next level of being successful so


Speaker 1 :your own process I mean you've talked
 about it before but it'll be great if you can describe it because our darkestmoments are perhaps the most interesting
 so your own and what the prediction of the another Depression economicdepression highest apologize economic
 depression can you talk to what you were feeling thinking planning and

Speaker 0 :strategizing in those moments yeah that
 was that was my biggest moment okay building my little company this is in1981-82 I had calculated that American
 banks had given a lot more money to lent a lot more money to Latin Americancountries than those countries were
 going to pay back and that they would have a debt crisis and that this hadsaid the economy tumbling and that was
 an extremely controversial point of view then it started to happen and ithappened in Mexico default that in
 August 1982 I thought that there was going to be a an economic collapse thatwas going to follow because there was a
 series of the other countries it was just playing out it as I had imaginedand that well it couldn't have been more
 wrong that was the exact bottom in the stock market because central bank seesmonetary policy blah blah blah and I
 couldn't have been more wrong and I was very publicly wrong and all of that andI lost money for me and I lost money for
 my clients and I was I only had a small company then but I had these were closepeople I had to let them go I was down
 to me as the last person that I I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dadto help to pay for my family bills very
 painful and at the same time I would say it definitely was one of the best thingsthat ever happened to me maybe the best
 thing for him happened to me because it changed my approach to decision makingit's what I'm saying in other words I
 kept saying okay how do I know whether I'm right how do Iknow what I'm not wrong it gave me that
 and now and it didn't give up by audaciousness because I was in aposition what am I going to do am I
 gonna go down back put on a tie go to Wall Street and D and just do thosethings no I can't bring myself to do
 that so I'm in a juncture how do I deal with my risk and how do I deal with thatand it tells me how to deal with my
 uncertainties and that taught me for example a number of techniques first tofind the smartest people I could find
 who disagreed with me and to have quality disagreement I learned the artof thoughtful disagreement I learned how
 to produce diversification I learned how to do a number of things that's is whatled me to create an idea meritocracy in
 other words person by person I hired them and I wanted the smartest peoplewho would be independent thinkers who
 would disagree with each other and me well so that we could be independentthinkers to go off to produce those
 audacious dreams because you have to be an independent thinker to do that and todo that not independently of the
 consensus independently of each other and then work ourselves through thatbecause who know whether you're gonna
 have the right answer and by doing that then that was the key to our successand the things that I want to pass along
 to people the reason I'm doing this podcast with you is you know I'm 70years old and that is a magical way of a
 achieving success if you can create an idea meritocracy it's it's so muchbetter in terms of achieving success and
 also quality relationships with people but that's what that experience gave me

Speaker 1 :so if we can look around a little bit
 longer the idea of an idea meritocracy it'sfascinating but especially because it
 seems to be rare not just in companies but in society so there's a lot ofpeople on Twitter and public discourse
 and politics and so on that are really stuck in certain sets of ideas whateverthey are so when you're confronted with
 it with an idea that said that's different than your own about aparticular topic what kind of process do
 you go through mental are you arguing through the idea withthe person sort of present is almost
 like a debate or do you sit on it and consider the world sort ofempathetically if this is true then what
 is that war look like does that world make sense and so on so what's theprocess of considering those conflicting


Speaker 0 :ideas I'm gonna answer that question but
 after saying first imposed implicit in your question is it's not common okaywhat's common produces only common
 results okay so don't judge yes anything that is good based on whether it'scommon because you're on its only going
 to give you common results if you want unique you have a unique approach yesokay and so that art of thoughtful
 disagreement is the is the capacity to hold two things in your mind at the sametime the G I think this makes sense and
 then saying I'm not sure it makes sense and then try to say why does it makesense and then to triangulate with
 others so if I'm having a discussion like that and I work myself through andI'm not sure then I have to do that in a
 good way so I always give attention for example what let's start off what doesthe other person know relative to what I
 know so if a person has a higher expertise or things I'm much moreinclined to ask questions I'm always
 asking questions if you want to learn you're asking questions you're notarguing okay you're taking in your
 assessing when it comes in to you does that make sense so you're learningsomething are you getting epiphanies and
 so on and I try to then do that if the conversation it as we're trying todecide what is true and we're trying to
 do that together and we see truth different then I might even call inanother really smart capable person and
 try to say what is true and how do we explore that together and you go throughthat same thing so I would I said I
 describe it as having open mindedness and assertiveness at the same time thatyou can simultaneous
 be open-minded and taken with that curiosity and then also be assertive andsay but that doesn't make sense why
 would this be the case and you do that

Speaker 1 :back and forth and when you're doing
 that kind of back and forth on the topic like the economy which you have to me orhave some naive but it seems both
 incredible and incredibly complex the economy the trading the transactionsthat these transactions between two
 individuals somehow add up to this giant mechanism you've put out a thirty minutevideo you have a lot of incredible
 videos online that people should definitely watch on YouTube but you'veput out this thirty minute video titled
 how the economic machine works that is probably one of the best if not the bestvideo I've seen that the internet in
 terms of educational videos so people should definitely watch it especiallybecause it's not that the individual
 components of the video are somehow revolutionary but the simplicity and theclarity of the different components just
 makes you there's a few light bulb moments there about what how the economyworks as a machine so as you described
 there's three main forces that drive the economy productivity growth short termdebt cycle long-term debt cycle the the
 former productivity growth is how valuable things how much value peoplecreate valuable things people create the
 latter is people borrowing from the their future selves to hopefully createthose valuable things faster so this is
 an incredible system to me maybe we can linger on in a little bitbut you've also said well most people
 think about as money is actually credit total amount of credit in the u.s. is 50trillion dollars total amount of money
 is three trillion dollars that's just crazy to memaybe maybe I'm silly maybe you can
 educate me but that seems crazy it gives me just pause that the humancivilization has been able to create a
 system that has so much credit so that's a long way to askdo you think credit is good or bad for
 society that system of that's so fundamentally based on credit I think

Speaker 0 :credit is great even though people often
 overdo it the credit is that somebody has earned money yeah and you know andwhat happens is they lend it to somebody
 else who's got better ideas and they cut a deal and then that person with thebetter ideas is gonna pay it back and if
 it works well it helps resource allocations go well providing peopleluck like the entrepreneurs and all of
 those they need capital they don't have capital themselves andso somebody's gonna give them capital
 and they'll give them credit and along those lines then what happens is it'snot managed well in a variety of ways so
 I did a another book on principles principles of big debt crisis that gointo that and it's free by the way I met
 put it free online on as a PDF so if you go online and you look principles forbig debt crisis is under my name you can
 download it in a PDF or you can buy a print book of it and it goes throughthat particular process and so you
 always have it over done in always the same way everything by the way almosteverything happens over and over again
 for the same reasons okay so these debt crisis has all happen over and overagain for the same reasons they get it
 over done in the book it explains how you identify whether it's overdone ornot they get it overdone and then you go
 through the process of making the adjustments according that and then andit explains how they can use the levers
 and so on if you didn't have credit then you would be sort of everybody sort ofbe stuck so credit is a good thing but
 it can easily be overdone so now we get into the quote what is money what iscredit okay you get into money and
 credit so if you're holding credit and you think that's worthwhile keep in mindthat the central bank let's say it can
 print the money what is that problem they you have an IOUthe IOU says you're going to get a
 certain number of dollars let's say or yet nor euros and that is what the IOUis and so the question is will you get
 that money and and what will it be worth and then also you have a governmentwhich is a participant in that process
 because they want they are on the hook they old money and then will they printthe money to make it easy for everybody
 to pay so you have to pay attention to those two I would suggest like you yourecommend to other people just take that
 30 minutes and it in it and it comes across pretty clearly but my conclusionis that of course you want it and even
 if you understand it and the cycles well you can benefit from those cycles ratherthan to be hurt by those cycles because
 I don't know the way the cycle works if somebody gets over indebted they have tosell an asset okay then I don't know me
 that's when assets become cheaper how do you acquire the asset it's a whole

Speaker 1 :process so again maybe another another


Speaker 0 :dumb question but there are no such
 things as dumb questions okay there you go

Speaker 1 :but what is money so you've mentioned
 you know credit and money it's another thing that if I just zoom out from analien perspective and look at human
 civilization it's incredible that we've created a thing that's not that onlyworks because currency because we all
 agree it has value so I guess my question is how do you think about moneyas this emergent phenomenon and what do
 you think is the future of money you've come into that Bitcoin other forms whatdo you think is its history and future
 how do you think about money there are

Speaker 0 :two things that money is for it's a
 medium of exchange and it's a store hold of wealth yes that's that that somemoney you know the so you could say
 something's a medium of exchange and then you could say is it a storehold of wealth okay so those and money
 is that vehicle that is those things and can be used to pay off your debt so whenyou have a debt and you provide it it
 pays off your debt so that that's that

Speaker 1 :process and it's a I apologize to
 interrupt but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth when everybodyrecognizes it to be a value that's right


Speaker 0 :right and so you see in the history and
 you around the world and you go to places I was in an island and thePacific in which they had as money these
 big stones and literally they were taking a boat this this big carved stoneand they were taking it from one of the
 islands to the other and it sank the the the piece of this big stone piece ofmoney that they had and it went to the
 bottom and they still perceived it as having value so that it was even thoughit's in the bottom and it's this big
 hunk of rock the fact that somebody owned it they would say oh I'll loan itfor this and that I've seen beads in
 different places shells converted to this and mediums of exchange and when welook at what we've got you're exactly
 right it is the notion that if I give it to youI can then take it and I can buy
 something with it and that's so it's a matter of perception okay and then we gothrough then the history of money and
 the vulnerabilities of money and what we have is there's through history there'sbeen two types of money those that are
 claims on something of value like the connection of to gold or something thatthat would be an or they just are money
 without any connection which and then we have a system now which is a Fiatmonetary system so that's what money is
 then it will last as long as its captive value and it works theway so let's say central banks when they
 get in the position of like they owe a lot of money like we have the in thecase it's increasingly the case and they
 also another a bind and they have the printing press to print the money andget out of that and you have a lot of
 people might be in that position then you can print it and then it could bedevalued in there and so history is show
 and forget about today history has shown that no currency has laughs everycurrency has either ended as being a
 currency been or devalued as the currency over periods of time longperiods of time so it evolved and it
 changes but everybody needs that medium of exchange and everybody needs thatstore hold of wealth so it keeps
 changing what is money over a period of

Speaker 1 :time but so much is being digitized
 today and there's this ideas that based on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so onso if all currencies like all empires
 come to an end what do you think well do you think something like Bitcoin mightemerge as as a common store value store
 of wealth and a medium of exchange

Speaker 0 :the problem with Bitcoin is that it's
 not a fact the medium exchange like it's not easy for me to go in there and buythings with it and then it's not an
 effective store hold of value because it has a volatility that's based onspeculation and the like so yeah it's
 not a very effective saving that's very different from Facebook's prop of astable value currency which would be
 effective as both a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth because ifyou were to hold it and in the way it's
 linked to number of things that it's linked to would mean that it could be avery effective store hold of wealth then
 you have a digital currency that could be a very effective medium exchange andstore hold of wealth that so in my
 opinion some digital currencies are likely to succeed more orbased on that ability to do it then the
 question is what happens okay what happens is two central banks allow thatto happen
 I really do believe it's possible to get a better form of money that centralbanks don't control okay a better force
 of money that the central banks don't control but then that's not yet happenedand we also have to and so they've got
 to go through that evolutionary process in order to go through that evolutionaryprocess first of all governments have
 got to allow that to happen which is to some extent a threat to themin terms of their power and and that's
 an issue and and then you have to also build the confidence and all of thecomponents of it to say okay that's
 going to be effective because I won't get in I won't have problems owning itso I think that digital currencies have
 a have some element of potential but there's a lot of hurdles that are goingto have to be gotten over I think that
 it'll be a very long time possibly never but anyway a very long time before wehave that let's say get into a position
 that would be you know effective means relative to gold let's say if you werethink of that because gold has a track
 record you know of thousands of years okay Unum all across countries and ithas its mobility it has the ability to
 put it down and has certain abilities it's got disadvantages relative todigital currencies but but central banks
 will hold it like their central banks that worry about others you know theother country central banks might worry
 about whether the US dollar is going to print or not in that and so the thingthey're going to go to is not going to
 be the digital currency thing they're going to go to is is gold or somethingelse some other currency they got a
 ticket and so I think it's a long way to

Speaker 1 :go well you think it's possible then one
 day we don't even have a central bank because of thea currency that doesn't that's cannot be
 controlled by the central bank is the

Speaker 0 :primary currency or is that some very it
 would be very remote possibility or very long in the future got it again may be a

Speaker 1 :dumb question but romanticize one when
 you sit back and you look you describe these transactions between individualssomehow creating short term debt cycles
 long-term debt cycles this productivity growth does it amaze you that this wholething works that that there's however
 many millions and millions of people in the United States globally over sevenbillion people that this thing between
 individual transactions it just it works

Speaker 0 :yeah it amazes me like I go I go back
 and forth between being in it and then I think like how does a credit card thatis that really possible
 I'm still used to I look up credit card and I put it on the guy doesn't know meyeah it'll streamlines okay we're making
 the digital entries is that really secure enough and that that kind ofthing and then it goes back and it goes
 this and it clears and it all happens and it what I marvel at that and thosetypes of things is because of the the
 capacity of the human mind to create abstractions that are true you know it'simagination and then the ability to go
 from one level and then if these things are true then you go to the next leveland if those things are true then you go
 to the next level and all those miracles that we almost become common it's likeit when I'm flying in a plane or what
 I'm looking at all of the things that happen when I get communications in themiddle of I don't know Africa or
 Antarctica and we're communicating in the ways where I see the face on my iPadof somebody my grandkid in someplace
 else and I look at and I say wow yes it all amazes me

Speaker 1 :so while being amazing do you have a
 sense the principles you describe that the whole thing is stable somehow alsoor is this I was just lucky so the the
 principles that you describe are those describing a system that is stablerobust and will remain so or is it a
 lucky accident of our early history my

Speaker 0 :area of expertise is economics and
 market so I get down to it like a real nitty-gritty yes I can tell you whetherthe plane is going to fall out of the
 sky yes because of its particular fundamentals I don't know enough aboutthat but it happens over and over again
 and so on it gives me faith ok so without me knowing it in the markets andthe economy I know those things quote
 well enough in a sense to say that by and large that structure is right whatwe're seeing is right now whether there
 are disruptions and it has effects that can come not because that structure isright I believe that's right
 but whether it can be hurt by let's say connectivity or journal entries theycould take from all the money away from
 you through your digital entries there's all sorts of things that can happen invarious ways that means that that money
 is worthless or the system Falls but from what I see in terms of its basicstructure and those complexities that
 still take my breath away I would say knowing them enough about the mechanicsof them that doesn't worry me


Speaker 1 :have you seen disruptions in your
 lifetime that really surprised you most

Speaker 0 :all the time this is one of the great
 lessons of my life is that there many times I've seen things that I was verysurprised about and that I realized
 almost all of those I was surprised about because they just they were justthe first time it happened to me they
 didn't happen in my lifetime before but when I researched them they happened inother places or other people
 lifetimes so for example I remember 1971 the dollar there was no such thing as adevaluation of a currency didn't
 experience it and with the dollar was connected to gold and I was watchingevents happen and then you get on and
 and he's that definition of money all of a sudden went out the window because itwas not tied to gold
 and then you have this devaluation and so and then or the first oil shock orthe second oil shot or so many of these
 things and when I but almost always I realized that they when I looked inhistory they happened before they just
 happened in other people's lifetimes which led me to realize that I needed tostudy history and what happened in other
 people's lifetimes and what happened in other countries and places so that Iwould have timeless and universal
 principles for dealing with that thing so I oh yeah I've been some you know theimplausible happening but it's like a
 one in a hundred year storm right okay

Speaker 1 :or it's or they've happened before yeah
 nothing just not to you let me talk about if we could about AI a little bitso if Bridgewater associates manage
 about a hundred sixty billion dollars in assets and our artificial intelligencesystems algorithms are pretty good with
 data what role in the future DC AI play in analysis and decision making in thiskind of data rich an impactful area of


Speaker 0 :investment I'm gonna answer that not
 only an investment but I give them more all encompassing rule for AI as I thinkyou know for the last 25 years we have
 taken our thinking and put them in algorithms and so we make decisions thatthe computer takes those
 criteria algorithms and they put them and they're in there and it takes dataand they operate as an independent
 decision-maker power in parallel with our decision-making so for me it's likethere's a chess game playing and on
 person with my chess game and I'm saying it made that move and I'm making themove and how do I compare those two
 moves so so we've done a lot but let me give you an if the future can bedifferent from the past and you don't
 have deep understanding you should not rely on AI okay those two things deep

Speaker 1 :understanding of the cause-effect


Speaker 0 :relationships that are leading you to
 place that bet in anything okay anything important let's say if it was dosurgeries and you would say how do I do
 surgeries I think it's totally fine to watch all the doctors do the surgeriesyou can put it on I take a a digital
 camera and do that convert that into AI algorithms that go to robots and havethem do surgeries and I'd be comfortable
 with that because if it'll do that if the keeps doing the same thing over andover again and you have enough of that
 that would be fine even though you may not understand the algorithms becauseyou're if the things happening over and
 over again and you're not asking the future would be the same thatappendicitis or whatever it is will be
 handled the same way the surgery that's fine however what happens with AI is forthe most part is it takes a lot of data
 and it with a high enough sample size and then it puts together its ownalgorithms okay there are two ways you
 can come up with algorithms you can either take your thinking and expressthem in algorithms or you can say let
 put the data in and say what is the algorithm when you that's machinelearning yeah and when you have machine
 learning it'll give you equations which quite often are notunderstandable you would try to say okay
 now describe what it's telling you it's very difficult to describe and so theycan escape understanding and so it's
 very good for doing those things that could be done over and over again ifyou're watching and you're not taking
 that but if the future is different from the past and you have that then you'reat the future is different from the past
 and you don't have deep understanding you're going to get in troubleand so that's the main thing as far as
 AI is concerned ai and I'd say computer replications of thinking in very ways Ithink it's particularly good for
 processing but but the the notion of what you want to do is better most ofthe time determined by the human mind
 that what are the principles like okay how should I raise my children it'sgonna be a long time before AI you're
 going to say it has a good enough judgment to do that who should I marryon all of those things maybe you can get
 the computer to help you but if you just took data and do machine learning it'snot going to find it if you were to then
 take one of my criteria for any of those questions and then say put them into analgorithm and you'd be a lot better off
 than if you took AI to do it but by and large the mind should be do used forinventing and those creative things and
 then the computer should be used for processing because it could process alot more information a lot faster a lot
 more accurately and a lot less emotionally so any notion of thinking inthe form of processing type thinking
 should be done by a computer and anything that is in the notion of doingthat other type of thinking should be
 operating with with the brain in operating in a way where you know youcan say ah that makes sense you know the


Speaker 1 :process of reducing your understanding
 down to principles is kind of like the process the the first one you mentioneda type of AI algorithm where you're
 encoding your expertise you're trying to program rightthe humanists trying to write a program
 how do you think that's attainable the process of reducing principles to acomputer program or when you when you
 say when you write about when you think of all principles is there still a humanelement that's not reducible to an


Speaker 0 :algorithm my experience has been that
 almost all things including those things that I thought were pretty muchimpossible to express I've been able to
 express in algorithms but that doesn't constitute all things so you can comeyou can who you can express far more
 than you can imagine you'll be able to express so I use the example of okayit's not how do you raise your children
 okay you will be able to take it one piece by piece okay how well at what agewhat school and the way to do that that
 means my experience is to take that and when you're in the momentof making a decision or just past making
 a decision to take the time and to write down your criteria for making thatdecision in words okay that that way
 you'll get your prize your principles down on paper I created an app onlinecall it's right now just on the iPhone
 it'll be in and try getting an Android it'll be an Android it'll be in a fewmonths it'll be on an awesome but it has
 an app in there that helps people write down their own principles because thisis very powerful so when you're in that
 moment where you've just you're thinking about it and you're thinking yourcriteria for you know choosing the
 school for your child or whatever that might be and you write down yourcriteria or whatever they are those
 principles you write down and you you that will at that moment make youarticulate your principles in a very
 valuable way and if you have the way that weoperate that you have easy access so
 then the next time that comes along you can go to that or you can show thoseprinciples to others to see if they're
 the right principles you will get a clarity of that principle that's reallyinvaluable in words and that'll help you
 a lot then but then you start to think how do i express that in data and it'llshock you about how you can do that
 you'll you'll form an equation that will show the relationship between theseparticular parts and then the
 essentially the variables that are going to go into that particular equation andyou will be able to do that and you take
 that little piece and you put it into the computer and then take the nextlittle piece and you put that into the
 computer and before you know it you will have a decision making system that's ofthe sort that I'm describing so that


Speaker 1 :you're almost making an argument against
 the past an earlier statement you've made and you're convinced to me at firstyou said there's no way a computer could
 raise a child essentially but now you've described in making me think of it ifyou have that kind of idea meritocracy
 you have this rigorous approach at Bridgewater takes an investment andapply it to raising a child it feels
 like through the process each is described we could as a society arriveat a set of principles for raising a
 child and encoded into a computer that

Speaker 0 :originality will not come from machine


Speaker 1 :learning the first time you do so that
 the original yes that's what I'm referring to but eventually as wetogether develop it and then we can


Speaker 0 :automate it that's why I'm saying the
 processing yes can be done by the computer so we're saying the same thingwe're not inconsistent and we're saying
 the same thing that the processing of that information in those algorithms canbe done by the computer in a very very
 effective way you don't need to sit there and process and try to weigh allthose things in your equation and all
 those things but that notion of okay how do I get at that principle and you're

Speaker 1 :saying you
 surprised yes you how much you can

Speaker 0 :express that's right you can do that so
 this is where I think you're going to see the future and right now we you knowgo to our devices and we get information
 to a large extent and then we get some guidance we have our GPS and the like inmy opinion principles principles
 principles principles I want to emphasize that you write them downyou've got those principles they will be
 converted into algorithms for decision-making and they're going toalso have the benefit of collective
 decision-making because right now individuals based on what stuck in theirheads are making their decisions in very
 ignorant ways they're not the best decision makers they're not the bestcriteria and they're operating when
 those principles are written down and converted into algorithms it's almostlike you'll look at that and follow the
 instructions and it'll give you better results medic medicine will be much morelike this you can go to your local
 doctor and you could ask his point of view and whatever and he's rushed and hemay not be the best doctor around and
 you're gonna go to this thing and get that same information or justautomatically have it input in that and
 it's gonna tell you okay here's what you should go do and it's going to be muchbetter than your local doctor and that
 that the converting of information into intelligence okayintelligence is the thing we're coming
 out with again I'm 70 and I want to pass all these things along so all thesetools that I've found need to develop
 all over these periods of time all those things I want to make an available andwhat's going to happen as you there
 they're going to see this they're going to see these tools operating much morethat way the idea of converting data
 into intelligence intelligence for example on what they are like right orwhat are your strengths and weaknesses
 intelligence on who why work well with under whatcircumstance analyzed intelligence we're
 gonna go from what are called systems of record which are a lot of okayinformation organized in the right way
 to intelligence and we're going to that Trent that'll be the next big move in myopinion and so you will get intelligence


Speaker 1 :back and that that intelligence comes
 from reducing things down to principles

Speaker 0 :into that's how what happens so what's


Speaker 1 :your intuition if you look at the future
 societies do you think we'll be able to reduce a lot of thethe details of our lives down to
 principles that would be further and further automated I think the real

Speaker 0 :question hinges on people's emotional
 emotions and irrational behaviors I think that there's subliminal thingsthat we want okay and then there's
 cerebral the you know conscious logic oh and the too often are at odds so there'salmost like to use and you write and so
 let's say what do you want and your mind will answer one thing your emotions orlands or something else so when I think
 about it I think emotions are I want inspiration I want love is a good thingbeing able to have a good impact but it
 is in the reconciliation of your subliminal wants and your intellectualwants so that you really say they're
 aligned and so to do that in a way to get what you want so irrationality is abad thing if it means that it doesn't
 make sense in getting you what you want but you better decide what you yoursatisfying is it the lower level you
 emotional subliminal one or is it the other but if you can align them so whatI find is that by going from my you
 experience the decision do this thing subliminally and that's the thing I wantit comes to the surface I find that if I
 can align that with what my logical me wants and does do the devil double-checkbetween them and I get the same sort of
 thing that that helps me a lot I find for example meditation is one of thethings that helps to achieve that
 alignment it's fantastic for achieving that alignment and often then I alsowant to not just do it in my head I want
 to say does that make sense help you you and so I do with other people and I sayokay well let's say I want this thing
 and whatever it does that make sense and when you do that kind of triangulationyou're to use and you do that with also
 the other way then you certainly want to be rationalright
 but rationality has to be defined by

Speaker 1 :those things and then you discover sort
 of new ideas that the drive you're just so-so is you're always at the edge ofthe set of principles you've developed
 you're doing new things always well that's where the intellect is needed

Speaker 0 :well and the inspiration the inspiration
 is needed to do that right like what are

Speaker 1 :you doing it for the segment what is the


Speaker 0 :velocity the hunger what's uh if you can


Speaker 1 :be Freud for a second what's in that
 subconscious well it's the thing that

Speaker 0 :drives us all I think you can't
 generalize of us I think different people are driven by different thingsthere's not a common one right so like
 if you would take the shapers I think it is a combination of subliminally it's acombination of excitement curiosity is


Speaker 1 :there a dark element there is there is
 their demons there's their fears is there in your sense uh most of the ones

Speaker 0 :the most of the ones that I'm dealing
 with I have not seen that I see the what I really see is who if I can do thatthat would be the most dream and then
 the act of creativity and you say whew so excitement is one of the thingscuriosity is a big pull okay and then
 tenacity you know okay at that to do those things but definitely emotions areentering into it then there's an
 intellectual component of it too okay it may be empathy it may can I have animpact can I have an impact the desire
 to have an impact that's an emotional thrill and but it also it has empathyand then you start to see spirituality
 but a spirituality I mean the connectedness to the whole you start tosee people operate those things those
 tend to be the things that you see the

Speaker 1 :most of and I think you're gonna shut
 down this idea completely but there's a notion that some of these shapersreally walk the line between sort of
 madness and genius do you think madness has a role in any of this or do youstill see Steve Jobs in a mosque is
 fundamentally rational the others a

Speaker 0 :continuum there then what comes to my
 mind is that genius is that often at the edge in some cases imaginary genius isat the edge of insanity and it's almost
 like a radio that I think okay if I can tune it just right it's playing rightbut if I go a little bit too far yeah it
 goes off yeah okay and so you can you can see this kay Jamison was studyingbipolar what it shows is that you know
 that's definitely the case because when you're going out there that imaginationwhatever is that the can be near the
 edge sometimes it doesn't have to always

Speaker 1 :be so let me ask you about automation
 that's been a part of public discourse recently what's your view on the impactof automation of whether we're talking
 about AI a more basic forms of automation on the economy in the shortterm in the long term do you have
 concerns about it as some do or do you think it's overblown it's not overblown

Speaker 0 :and it's a it's a giant thing it'll come
 at us in a very big way and in the future we're right at the edge of evenreally accelerating it it's had a big
 impact and it will have a big impact and it's a two-edged sword because it'llhave tremendous benefits and at the same
 time it has profound benefits in employment and distributions of wealthbecause the way I think think about it
 is there are certain things human beings can do and over time we've evolved to goto almost higher and higher levels and
 now we're almost like we're at this level you know it used to be your laboryou would then do your labor and okay we
 can get past the labor we got tractors and things and you go up up up up up andwe're up over here and to the point in
 our minds we're okay anything related to mental processing the computer canprobably do better and we can find that
 and so other than almost inventing you're at a point where these are theCommission's and the automation will
 probably do it better and and that's accelerating and that's a force andthat's a force for the good and at the
 same time it what it does is it displaces people in terms of employmentand changes and it produces wealth gaps
 and all of that so I think the real issue is that that has to be viewed as anational emergency in other words I
 think the well the wealth gap theme the income gap the opportunity gap all ofthose things that force is creating the
 problems that we're having today a lot of the problems the the great polaritythe disenfranchised eat dis not equal
 not anything approaching equality of education all of these problems a lot ofproblems are coming as a result of that
 and so there it needs to be viewed really as an emergency situation inwhich there's a good work good plan
 worked out for how to deal with that effectively so that it's dealt witheffectively so because it's it's it you
 know it's good for the average it's good for the impact but it's not good foreveryone in the crates that polarity so
 it's got to be dealt with yeah and

Speaker 1 :you've talked about the American Dream
 and that that's something that all people should have an opportunity forand then we need to reform capitalism to
 give that opportunity for everyone let me ask kind of one of the ideas in termsof safety nets that support that kind of
 opportunity there's been a lot of discussion of universal basic incomeamongst people so there's
 andrew yang who's running on that he's a political candidate running forpresident on the idea of the universal
 basic income what do you think about that giving a thousand dollars or someamount of money to everybody as a way to
 give them the the padding the freedom to sort of take leaps to take the call foradventure to take the crazy procedure


Speaker 0 :before I get right into the my thoughts
 on universal basic income I want to start with the notion that opportunityeducation development creating equality
 so that you people say there's equal opportunity and is the most importantthing and then to find out what is the
 amount how are you going to provide that what where what how does it how do youget the money into a public school
 system how do you get the teaching how do you what do the fleshing out thatplan to create equal opportunity in all
 of its various forms is the most pressing thing to do and so I'm you knowthat is that the the opportunity is the


Speaker 1 :most important one you're kind of
 implying is the earlier the better sort of like opportunity to education so inthe early development of a human being
 is when you should have the equal opportunities that's the most important

Speaker 0 :right in the first phase of your life
 which goes from birth until you're on your own and you're an adult and you'renow out there and you deal with early
 childhood development okay and you take the brain and you say what's importantthe child care okay like the it makes a
 world of difference for example if you have good parents who are trying tothink about instilling the stability in
 a non traumatic environment to provide them so I would say the good guidancethat normally comes from parents and the
 good education that they're receiving are you know the most important thingsin that person's development the
 ability to be able to be prepared to go out there and then to go into a marketthat's an equal opportunity job market
 to be able to then go into that kind of market is a system that creates not onlyfairness anything else is not fair and
 then in addition to that it also is a more effective economic system becausethe consequences of not doing that are
 to a society or devastating if you look at what the difference in outcomes forsomebody who completes high school or
 doesn't complete high school or does each one of those state changes and youlook at what that means in terms of
 their costs to society not only themselves but their cost andincarceration costs and then on crimes
 and all of those things it's economically better for the society andit's fairer if they can complete fake an
 get those particular things once they have those things then you move on toother things but yes from birth all the
 way through that process anything less than that is bad is a tragedy and and soon so that's what uh that's yeah those
 are the things that I'm estimate and so my I'm what I would want to above allelse is to provide that so with that in
 mind now we'll talk about universal basic income start with that well now we

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :can talk about well the bright because
 you have to have that now the question is what's the best way to provide thatokay so when I look at UB I I really
 think is what is going to happen with that thousand dollars okay and will thatthousand dollars come from another
 program does that come from an early childhood developmental program who areyou giving the thousand dollars to and
 what will they do for that thousand dollars I mean like my reaction would beI think it's a great thing that
 everybody should have almost a thousand dollars in their bank and so on but whendo they get to make decisions or who's
 the parent a lot of pit times you can give a thousand dollars to somebody andit could have a negative result it can
 have you know they can use that money detrimental II not just foroctave Lee and if that money's coming
 away from some of those other things that are going to produce the things Iwant
 and you're shifted to let's say to come in and give a check doesn't mean it'soutcomes are going to be good and
 providing those things that I think are so fundamental important if it was justeverybody can have a thousand dollars
 and use it so when the time is not well and use it well that would be reallyreally good because it's almost like
 everybody you'd wish everybody could have a thousand dollars worth of wiggleroom in their lives okay and I think
 that would be great I love that but we I want to make sure that these otherthings that are taken care of so if it
 comes out of that budget and you know I don't want it to come out of that budgetthat's gonna be doing those things and I
 you know so you have to figure it out

Speaker 1 :and you know a certain skepticism that
 human nature will use may not always in fact frequently may not use thatthousand dollars for the optimal to
 support the optimal trajectory some will

Speaker 0 :and some won't one of the big advantages
 of universal basic income is that if you put it in the hands let's say parentswho know how to do the right things and
 make the right choices yes for their children because they're responsible andyou say I'm gonna give them a thousand
 dollars wiggle room to use for the benefit of their children wow thatsounds great if you put it in the hands
 of let's say an alcoholic or drug addicted parent who is not making thosechoices well for their children and what
 they do is they take that thousand dollars and they don't use it well thenthat's going to produce more harm than


Speaker 1 :good well put your if I may say so one
 of the richest people in the world so you're a good person ask does money buyhappiness


Speaker 0 :no it's been shown that between once you
 get over a basic level of income so that you can take care of the pain then youknow you can health and whatever there's
 no correlation between the level of happiness that one has and the level ofmoney that one has they that would
 has the highest correlation is quality relationships with others community ifyou look at surveys of these things
 across all surveys and all societies it's a sense of community and per intopersonal relationships that is not in
 any way correlated with money you can go down to native tribes and you know verypoor places or you can go in all
 different communities and so they have the opportunity to have that I'm verylucky in that I started with nothing so
 I had the full range I can tell you I you know I not having money but but andthen having quite a lot of money and I
 you know I did that in the right order

Speaker 1 :I'll tell you started from nothing in


Speaker 0 :Long Island yeah and my dad was a jazz
 musician but I but I had all really that I needed because I had two parents wholoved me and took good care of me and I
 went to a public school that was a good public school and basically you knowthat you don't need much more than that
 in order to that's the equal opportunity part anyway what I'm saying is no Iexperienced the range and else and there
 are many studies on the answer to your question no money does not bringhappiness bring money gives you an
 ability to make choices does it get in

Speaker 1 :the way in any way of forming those deep


Speaker 0 :meaningful relationships it can there
 are lots of ways that it makes negative that's one of them it could stand in theway of that yes okay but I could almost
 list the ways that it could stand it could be a problem

Speaker 1 :yeah what does it buy so if you can
 elaborate your mission a bit of freedom

Speaker 0 :at the most fundamental level it doesn't
 take a whole lot but it takes enough that you can take care of your yourselfand your family to be able to learn do
 the basics of have the relationships have healthcare the basics of thosetypes of things you know you can cover
 the patients and then to have maybe enough securitybut maybe not too much security that's
 right yeah that you essentially are okay okay that is that's really good and youdon't that's what a that's what money


Speaker 1 :will get you and everything else is
 could go either way

Speaker 0 :well there's more there's more okay then
 beyond that what it then starts to do that's the most important thing yes butbeyond that what its Tensta much to do
 is to help to make your dreams happen in various ways okay so for example now Iyou know look at my case it's a those
 dreams might not be just my own dreams they're their impact on others dreamsokay so my own dreams might be um I
 don't know I can pass along these at my stage in life I could press along theseprinciples to you and I can give those
 they or I could do whatever I can go on an adventure I can start a business Ican do those other things be productive
 I can self actualize in ways that might be not possible otherwise and so that'sthat's my own belief and then in a dot
 and I can also help others I mean this is you know to the extent when you getolder and with time and whatever very
 you start to feel connected spiritual spirituality is what I'm referring toyou can start to have an effect on
 others that's beneficial and so on gives you the ability I could tell youthat people who are very wealthy who
 have that a feel that they don't have enough money Bill Gates will feel almostbroke because relative to the things
 he'd like to accomplish through the Gates Foundation and things like thatyou know oh my god he doesn't have
 enough money to accomplish the things he wishes for but those things are not youknow they're not the most fundamental
 things so I think that people sometimes think money has value money doesn't havevalue the money is like you say just a
 of exchange in a store although well and so what you have to say is what is itthat you're going to buy now there are
 other people who get their gratification in ways that are different from me but Ithink in many cases that let's say
 somebody who used money to have a status symbol I what would I say or that'sprobably unhealthy but then I don't know
 somebody who says I love a great gorgeous painting and it's going to costlots of money in my priorities mecan't
 not Kemp get there but but that doesn't mean I don't who am I to judge others interms of let's say their elements of the
 freedom to do those things so it's a little bit complicated but by and largethat you know that's my view on money


Speaker 1 :and wealth so let me ask you in terms of
 the idea of so much of your passions and life has been through something youmight be able to call work Alan Watts
 has this quote he said that the real key to life secret of life is to becompletely engaged with what you're
 doing in the here and now and instead of calling it work realize that it's playso I'd like to ask what is the role of
 work in your life's journey or in a life's journey and what do you thinkabout this modern idea of kind of
 separating work and let work-life

Speaker 0 :balance I have a principle that I
 believe in is make your work in your passion the same thing ok ok so that'ssimilar face
 uh-uh-uh-uh-uh in other words if you can make your work in your passion it's justgonna work out great and then of course
 people have different purposes of work and I don't want to be theoretical aboutthat people have to take care of their
 family so money at a certain point is the base is an important component ofthat work so you look beyond that what
 is the money gonna get you and what are you're trying to achieve but the mostimportant thing I agree is meaningful
 work and meaningful relationships like if you can get into the thing thatyou're at your mission that you're on
 and you are excited about that mission that you're on and then you cando that with people who you have the
 meaningful relationships with you have meaningful work and meaningfulrelationships I mean that is fabulous


Speaker 1 :for most people and it seems that many
 people struggle to get there not out of not necessarily becausethey're constrained by the fact that
 they have the financial constraints of having to provide for their family andso on but it's I mean moat you know this
 idea is out there that there needs to be a work-life balance which means thatmost people on this thing we're going to
 return to the same things most doesn't mean optimal but most people seem to notbe doing their life's passion not be not
 unifying work and passion why do you think that is is well the work-life

Speaker 0 :balance there's a life arc that you go
 through starts at zero and ends somewhere in the vicinity of 80 andthere is a phase and there's a and you
 could look at the different degrees of happiness that happened in those phasesI can go through that if that was
 interesting but we don't have time probably for it but you get in the partof the life that part of the life which
 has the lowest level of happiness is aged 45 to 55 and and and because as youmove into this second phase of your life
 in the first phase of your life is when you're learning dependent on otherssecond phase of your life is when you're
 working and others are dependent on you and you're trying to be successful andin that phase of one's life you
 encounter the work-life balance challenge because you're trying to besuccessful at work and successful at
 parenting and successful and successful and all those things that take yourdemand and they get into that and I
 understand that problem in the work/life balance the issue is primarily to knowhow to approach that okay so I
 understand it stressful it produces stress and it produces bad results andit produces the lowest level of happy
 in one's life it's interesting as you get later in life the levels ofhappiness rise in the highest level of
 happiness is between ages 70 and 80 which is interesting there are otherreasons but in appspot I want and that
 and the key to work-life balance is to realize and to learn how to get more outof an hour of life okay because an hour
 of work what people are thinking is that they have to make a choice between onething and another and of course they
 they do but they don't realize that if they develop the skill to get a lot moreout of an hour it's the equivalent Earl
 if-- and so you know that's why in the book principles I try to go into okaynow how can you get a lot more out of
 out of an hour that allows you to get more life into your life and it reducesthe work-life balance and that's the


Speaker 1 :primary struggle in that 35 to 45 you
 know if you could linger on that sort of what are the ups and downs of life interms of happiness in general and
 perhaps in your own life when you look back at the moments the peaks it's

Speaker 0 :pretty pretty much same pattern really
 in one's life is tends to be a very happy period all the way up and sixteenis like a really great happy you know I
 think like myself you start to get elements of freedom you get yourdriver's license you know whatever but
 16 is there a junior year in high school quite often could be a stressful periodto try to get thing about the high
 school you go into college tends to be very highhappiness generally speaking freedom and
 then freedom yeah friendships all of that freedom is a big thing and then youand then 20 23 is a peak point kind of
 an unhappy 'no staff freedom then sequentially one has a great time theydate they go out and so on you find the
 love of your life you begin to develop a familyand then with that as time happens you
 have more of your work-life balance challenges that come and yourresponsibilities and then as you get
 there in that mid part of your life that is the most that is the biggest strugglechances are you will crash in that
 period of time you know you'll have you'll have your series of failuresthat's the that's that that's when you
 go into the abyss you learn you hopefully learn from thosemistakes you have to metamorphosis you
 come out you change hopefully become better and you take moreresponsibilities and so on and then when
 you get to the later part as you are starting to approach the transition inthat late part of the second phase of
 your life before you go into the third phase of your life second phase isyou're working trying to be successful
 third phase of your life is you want people to be successful without you okayyes yeah you want your kids to be
 successful without you because when you're at that phase they're at makingtheir transition from the first phase to
 the second phase and they're trying to be successful you want them to besuccessful without you and you have and
 your parents are gone and then you have freedom and then you have freedom againand that with that freedom and then you
 have these histories shown with this you have friendships you have perspective onlife you have different things and
 that's one of the reasons that that later part of the life can be real it onaverage actually it's the highest very
 interesting thing if they and they their surveys and say how good do you look andhow good do you feel and and that's the
 highest survey the person now they not look in the best yeah and they're notfeeling the best right maybe it's thirty
 five that they're actually looking the best and feeling the best but they rankthe highest at that point survey results
 of being the highest so that seventy to eighty period of time because it has todo with an attitude on life then you
 start to have grandkids Oh grandkids are great and you start to experience thattransition well
 so that's what the Ark of life pretty much looks like in and I'm experiencingit you know that's good that when you


Speaker 1 :meditate we're all human or immortal
 when you meditate it on your own mortality having achieved a lot ofsuccess on whatever dimension what do
 you think is the meaning of it all the meaning of our short existence on earth

Speaker 0 :as human beings I think that evolution
 is the greatest force of in the universe and that were all tiny bits of anevolutionary type of process where it's
 just matter and machines that go through time and that we all have a deeplyembedded inclination to evolve and
 contribute to evolution so I think it's too personally evolved and contribute tothe evolution I could have predicted you


Speaker 1 :would answer that way it's brilliant and
 exactly right and I think we've said it before but I'll say it again you have alot of incredible videos out there that
 people should definitely watch I don't say this often I mean it's literally thebest spend of time and in terms of
 reading principles and reading basically anything you write on LinkedIn and so onthere's a really good use of time it's a
 lot of light bulb moments a lot of transformative ideas in there so alrightthank you so much it's been an honor and
