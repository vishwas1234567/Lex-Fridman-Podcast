Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :conversation with Sean Carroll


Speaker 1 :Isaac Newton developed what we now call
 classical mechanics that you describe very nicely in your new book because youdo with a lot of basic concepts in
 physics so was classical mechanics I can throw a rock and can predict thetrajectory of that rocks flight but if
 we could put ourselves back into Newton's time his theories work topredict things but as I understand he
 himself thought that they were their interpretations of those predictionswere absurd perhaps he just said it for
 religious reasons and so on but in particular sort of a world ofinteraction without contact so action at
 a distance it didn't make sense to them in a sortof a human interpretation level does it
 make sense to you that things can affect other things at a distance it does but

Speaker 0 :you know that so that was one of
 Newton's worries you're actually right in a slightly different way about thereligious worries he he was smart enough
 this is off the topic with still fascinating Newton almost invented chaostheory as soon as he invented classical
 mechanics he realized that in the solar system so he was able to explain howplanets move around the Sun but
 typically you would describe the orbit of the earthignoring the effects of Jupiter and
 Saturn and so forth just doing the earth and the Sun he he kind of knew eventhough he couldn't do the math that if
 you included the effects of Jupiter and Saturn the other planets the solarsystem would be unstable like the orbits
 of the planets would get out of whack so he thought that God would interveneoccasionally to sort of move the planets
 back into orbit which is how you could only way you could explain how they werethere presumably forever but the worries
 about classical mechanics were a little bit different they worried about gravityin particularly wasn't it worried about
 classical mechanics worried about gravity how in the world does the earthknow that there's something called the
 Sun 93 million miles away that is exerting gravitational force onit and he said he literally said you
 know I leave that for future generations to think about because I don't know whatthe answer is and in fact the people
 under emphasize this but future generations figured it out Pierre SimoneLaplace in circa 1800 showed that you
 could rewrite Newtonian gravity as a field theory so instead ofjust talking about the force due to
 gravity you can talk about the gravitational field or the gravitationalpotential field and then there's no
 action at a distance it's exactly the same theory empirically it makes exactlythe same predictions but what's
 happening is instead of the Sun just reaching out across the void there is agravitational field in between the Sun
 and the earth that obeys an equation Laplace's equation cleverly enough andthat tells us exactly what the field
 does so even in Newtonian gravity you don't need action at a distance now whatmany people say is that Einstein solved
 this problem because he invented general relativity and general relativitythere's certainly a field in between the
 Earth and the Sun but also there's the speed of light as a limit in Laplace'stheory which was exactly Newton's theory
 just in a different mathematical language there could still beinstantaneous action across the universe
 whereas in general relativity if you shake something here its gravitationalimpulse radiates out at the speed of
 light and we call that a gravitational wave and we can detect those so but I Ireally it rubs me the wrong way to think
 that we should presume the answer should look one way or the other like if itturned out that there was action at a
 distance in physics and that was the best way to describe things that I woulddo it that way it's actually a very deep
 question because when we don't know what the right laws of physics are when we'reguessing at them when we're
 hypothesizing at what they might be we are often guided by our intuitionsabout what they should be I mean
 Einstein famously was very guided by his intuitions and he did not like the ideaof action at a distance we don't know
 whether he was right or not it depends on your interpretation of quantummechanics and it depends on even how you
 talk about quantum mechanics within any one interpretation if you see every

Speaker 1 :forces of field or any other
 interpretation of action at a distance he's just stepping back to sort ofcaveman thinking like do you really can
 you really sort of understand what it means for a force to be a field aseverywhere so if you look at gravity
 like what do you think about I think so it's just something that you've been canand by society to think that to map the
 fact that science is extremely well predictive of something to believingthat you actually understand it like you
 can intuitively under the how as the degree that human beings can understandanything that you actually understand it
 are you just trusting the beauty and the power of the predictive power science

Speaker 0 :that depends on what you mean by this
 idea of truly understandings right right you know I mean can I Lily understandfour months Last Theorem you know it's
 easy to state it but do I really appreciate what it means for incrediblylarge numbers right yeah I think yes I
 think I do understand it but like if you want to just push people on well you putyour intuition doesn't go to the places
 where Andrew Wiles needed to go to prove Fermat's Last Theorem and I can say fineby something I understand the theorem
 and likewise I think that I do have a pretty good intuitive understanding offields pervading space time whether it's
 the gravitational field or the electromagnetic field or whatever theHiggs field of course one's intuition
 gets worse and worse as you get trickier in the quantum field theory and allsorts of new phenomena that come up in
 quantum field theory so our intuitions aren't perfect but I think it's alsookay to say that our intuitions get
 trained right like you know I have different intuitions now that I had whenI was a baby that's okay that's not an
 intuition is not necessarily intrinsic to who we are we can we can train it a

Speaker 1 :little bit so that's where I'm gonna
 bring in norm Chomsky for a second who thinks that our cognitive abilities aresort of evolved through time and so
 they're they're biologically constrained and so there's a clear limit as he putsit to our cognitive abilities and it's a
 very harsh limit but you actually kind of said something interesting and natureversus nurture thing here is we can
 train our intuitions to sort of build up the cognitive muscles to be able tounderstand some of these tricky casas so
 do you think there's limits to our understanding that's deeply rootedhard-coded into our biology that we
 can't overcome

Speaker 0 :there could be limits to things like our
 ability to visualize okay but when someone like Ed Witten proves a theoremabout you know hundred dimensional
 mathematical spaces he's not visualizing it he's doing the math that doesn't stophim from understanding the result I
 think and I would love to understand this better but my rough feeling whichis not very educated is that you know
 there's some threshold that one crosses in abstraction when one becomes kind oflike a Turing machine right one has the
 ability to contain in one's brain logical formal symbolic structures andmanipulate them and that's a leap that
 we can make as human beings that that dogs and cats haven't made and once youget there I'm not sure there are any
 limits to our ability to understand the scientific world at all maybe there arethere's certainly a ability limits on
 our ability to calculate things right you know people are not very good attaking cube roots of million digit
 numbers in their head but that's not an element of understanding it's certainlynot a little bit in principle so of


Speaker 1 :course there's a human you would say
 that doesn't feel to be limits to our understanding but sort of hey have youthought that the universe is actually a
 lot simpler than it appears to us and we just will never be able to like it'soutside of our okay so us our cognitive
 abilities combined with our mathematical prowess and whatever kind ofexperimental simulation devices we can
 put together is there limits to that is is it possible there's limits to that

Speaker 0 :well of course it's possible there is or
 is there any good reason to think that we're anywhere close to the limits is aharder question look imagine asking this
 question 500 years ago to the world's greatest thinkers right like are weapproaching the limits of our ability to
 understand the natural world and by definition there are questions about thenatural world that are most interesting
 to us that are the ones we but yet understand right so there'salways we're always faced with these
 puzzles we don't yet know and I don't know what they would have said fivehundred years ago but they didn't even
 know about classical mechanics much less quantum mechanics so we know that theywere nowhere close to how well they
 could do right they could do normally better than they were doing at the timeI see no reason why the same thing isn't
 true for us today so of all the worries that keep me awake at night the humanminds inability to rationally comprehend
 the world is low on the list well put so

Speaker 1 :one interesting philosophical point and
 quantum mechanics bring up is the that you talk about the distinction betweenthe world as it is and the world as we
 observe it so staying at the human level for a second how big is the gap betweenwhat our perception system allows us to
 see and the world as it is outside our minds I sort of so if not at the quantummechanical level yeah as just are these
 particular tools we have which is a few senses and cognitive abilities to

Speaker 0 :process those senses well that last
 phrase having the cognitive abilities to process them carries a lot right I meanthere is our sort of intuitive
 understanding of the world you don't need to teach people about gravity forthem to know that apples fall from trees
 right that's something that we figure out pretty quickly object permanencethings like that the three
 dimensionality of space even if we don't have the mathematical language to saythat we kind of know that it's true on
 the other hand no one opens their eyes and sees atoms all right or moleculesfor ourselves for that matter forget
 about quantum mechanics so but we got there we got to understanding that thereare atoms and cells using the
 combination of our senses and our cognitive capacities so adding theability of our cognitive capacities to
 our senses is adding an enormous amount and I don't think there's a hard andfast boundary you know if you believe in
 cells if you believe that we understand those then there's no reason you believewe can't believe in quantum mechanics
 just as well what to you is the most

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :beautiful idea in physics
 conservation of momentum can you elaborate yeah if you were Aristotlewhen Aristotle wrote his book on physics
 he made the following very obvious point we're on video here right so people cansee this so if I push the bottle let me
 cover this bottle so we do not have a mess but okay so I push the bottle itmoves and if I stop pushing itself
 moving yes and this is this kind of thing is repeated a large number oftimes all over the place if you don't
 keep pushing things they stop moving this is a indisputably true fact aboutour everyday environment okay and for
 Aristotle this blew up into a whole picture of the world in which things hadnatures and teleology x' and they had
 places they wanted to be and when you were pushing them you were moving themaway from where they wanted to be and
 they would return and stuff like that and it took a thousand years or fifteenhundred years for people to say actually
 if it weren't for things like dissipation and air resistance andfriction and so forth the natural thing
 is for things to move forever in a straight line there's a constantvelocity right conservation of momentum
 and that is the reason why I think that's the most beautiful idea inphysics is because it shifts us from a
 view of nature's and teleology to a view of patterns in the world so when youwere Aristotle you needed to talk a
 vocabulary of why is this happening what's the purpose of it what's thecause etc because you know it's nature
 does or does not want to do that whereas once you believe in conservation ofmomentum things just happen they they
 just follow the pattern you give me you have Laplace's deamon ultimately rightyou give me the state of the world today
 I can predict what's gonna do in the future I can predict where it was in thepast it's impersonal
 and it's also instantaneous it's not directed toward any future goals it'sjust doing what it does given the
 current state of the universe that I think even more than either classicalmechanics or quantum mechanics and that
 is the profound deep insight that gets modern science off the groundyou don't need nature's and purposes and
 goals you just need some patterns

Speaker 1 :so it's the first moment in our
 understanding of the way the universe works where you branch from theintuitive physical space to kind of the
 space of ideas and also the other point you said which is conveniently most ofthe interesting ideas are acting in the
 moment you don't need to know the history of time or the future then of

Speaker 0 :course this took a long time to get
 there right I mean the conservation momentum itself took hundreds of yearsit's weird just like someone would say
 something interesting and then the next interesting thing would be said like 150or 200 years later right they weren't
 even talking to each other there was reading each other's books and probablythe first person to directly say that in
 outer space in the vacuum projectile would move at a constant velocity wasAvicenna even Sina and the Persian
 Golden Age circa 1000 and he didn't like the idea he used that just likefurniture used Schrodinger's cat to
 studies freely you don't believe that right even Sina was saying surely youdon't believe there really is a vacuum
 because if there was a really vacuum things could keep moving forever rightbut still he got right the idea that
 there was this conservation of something impetus or mile he would call it andthat's 500 years 600 600 years before
 classical mechanics and Isaac Newton so you know Galileo played a big role inthis but he didn't exactly get it right
 and so it just takes a long time for this to sink in because it is so againstour everyday experience do you think it


Speaker 1 :was a big leap a brave or a difficult
 leap of sort of math and science to be able to say that momentum was conserved

Speaker 0 :I do you know I think it's a example of
 human reason in action you know even Aristotle knew that his theory hadissues because you could fire an arrow
 and it would go a long way before it stopped so if his theory was things justautomatically stopped what's going on
 and he had this elaborate story I don't know if you've heard the story but thearrow would push the air in front of it
 away and the molecules of air would run around to the back of the arrow and pushit again and anyone reading this is
 going like really that's that's what you thought but it was that kind of thoughtexperiment that
 we got people to say like actually know if it weren't for the air molecules atall there I would just go on by itself
 and it's always this give-and-take between thought and experience back andforth right theory and experiment we
 would say today another big question

Speaker 1 :that I think comes up certainly with
 quantum mechanics is what's the difference between math and physics to

Speaker 0 :you to me you know very very roughly
 math is about the logical structure of all possible worlds and physics is aboutour actual world and it just feels like


Speaker 1 :our actual world is a gray area when you
 start talking about interpretations of quantum mechanics or no I'm certainly

Speaker 0 :using the word world in the broadest
 sense all of reality so I think the reality is specific I don't think thatthere's every possible thing going on in
 reality I think there are rules whether it's the Schrodinger equation orwhatever so i think i think that there's
 a sensible notion of the set of all possible worlds and we live in one ofthem the world that we're talking about
 might be a multiverse might be many worlds of quantum mechanics might bemuch bigger than the world of our
 everyday experience but it's still one physically contiguous world in some

Speaker 1 :sense but so if you look at the overlap


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :of math and physics it feels like when
 physics tries to reach for understanding of our world it uses the tools of mathto sort of reach beyond the limit of our
 current understanding what do you make of that process of sort of using math toso you start maybe with intuition or you
 might start with the math and then build up an intuition or but this kind ofreaching into the darkness into the
 mystery of the world would math well I

Speaker 0 :think I would put it a little bit
 differently I think we have theories theories of the physical world which wethen extrapolate and ask you know what
 do we conclude if we take these seriously well beyond where we'veactually tested them it is separately
 true that math is really really useful when we construct physical theories andyou know famously Eugene Wigner asked
 about the unreasonable success of method Mattox and physics I think that's alittle bit wrong because anything that
 could happen any other theory of physics that wasn't the real world with someother world you could always describe it
 mathematically it's just it might be a mess the surprising thing is not thatmath works but that the math is so
 simple and easy that you can write it down on a t-shirt right I mean that'swhat is amazing that's an enormous
 compression of information that seems to be valid in the real world so that's aninteresting fact about our world which
 maybe we could hope to explain or just take as a brute fact I don't know butonce you have that you know it there's
 this the indelible relationship between math and physics but but philosophicallyI do want to separate them well we what
 we extrapolate we don't extrapolate math because there's a whole bunch of wrongmath you know that doesn't apply to our
 world right we extrapolate the physical theory that we best think explains our

Speaker 1 :world again an unanswerable question why
 do you think our world is so easily compressible into beautiful equations

Speaker 0 :yeah I mean like I just hinted at I
 don't know if there's an answer to that question there could be what would an

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :answer look like well an answer could
 look like if you showed that there was something about our world that maximizedsomething you know the the mean of the
 simplicity and the powerfulness of the laws of physics or you know with maybewe're just generic maybe in the set of
 all possible worlds this is what the world would look like right like I wereI don't really know I tend to think not
 I tend to think that there is something specific and rock-bottom about the factsof our world that don't have further
 explanation like the fact of the world exists at all and furthermore thespecific laws of physics that we have I
 think in some sense we're just gonna at some level we're gonna say and that'show it is and you know we can't explain
 anything more we I don't know how if we're anywhere close to that right nowbut that seems plausible to me and


Speaker 1 :speaking of rock bottom one of the
 things so your book kind of reminded me a reveal to me is that what'sfundamental and what's emergent it just
 feels like I don't even know anymore what's fundamental inin physics if there's anything it feels
 like everything especially with quantum mechanics is revealing to us is thatmost interesting things that I would as
 a he as a limited human would think are fundamental or it can actually beexplained as emergent from the the more


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :deeper laws I mean we don't know of
 course is you had to get that on the table like we don't know what isfundamental we do know we do have reason
 to say that certain things are more fundamental than others right atoms andmolecules are more fundamental than
 cells and organs quantum fields are more fundamental than atoms and molecules wedon't know if that ever bottoms out I I
 do think that there's sensible ways to think about this the if you if youdescribe something like this table as a
 table it has a height and a width and it's made of a certain material and hasa certain solidity and weight and so
 forth that's the very useful description as far as it goes there's a whole notherdescription at this table in terms of a
 whole collection of atoms strung together in certain ways the language ofthe atoms is more comprehensive than the
 language of the table you could break apart to the table smash it to piecesstill talk about it as atoms but you
 could no longer talk about it as a table right so I think of thiscomprehensiveness the domain of validity
 of a theory gets broader and broader as the theory gets more and more

Speaker 1 :fundamental so what do you think Newton
 would say maybe write in a book review if you read your latest book on quantummechanics something deeply hidden would


Speaker 0 :take a long time for him to think that
 any of this was making any sense you

Speaker 1 :catch him up pretty quick in the
 beginning yeah give him a shout out

Speaker 0 :that's right I mean he used the man I'm
 happy to say that Newton was the greatest scientists who ever lived Imean he met in calculus in his spare
 time which would have made it the greatest mathematician just all byhimself right I'll buy that one thing
 but of course you know it's funny because Newton was in some sense still apre-modern thinker rocky Kolb who is a
 cosmologists at at the University of Chicago said that you know Galileo eventhough he can be
 for Newton was a more modern thinker than than Newton was like if he gotGalileo and brought him to the present
 day you take him six months to catch up andthen he be in your office telling you
 while your most recent paper was wrong whereas Newton just thought in this kindof more mystical way you know he wrote a
 lot more about the Bible and alchemy didn't he ever did about physics and buthe was also more brilliant than anybody
 else and and way more mathematically astute than Galileo so I really don'tknow you know he might have he might
 just yeah say like give me the textbooks leave me alone for a few months and thenbe caught up but he but he or he might
 have had mental blocks against against seeing the world in this way I really

Speaker 1 :don't know or perhaps find an
 interesting mystical interpretation of

Speaker 0 :quantum mechanics very possible yeah is


Speaker 1 :there any other scientists or
 philosophers through history that you would like to know their opinion of your

Speaker 0 :book that's against a good question um I
 mean Einstein is the obvious one right y'all and he was not that long ago butspeculate at the end of my book about
 what his opinion would be I am curious as to you know what about olderphilosophers like Hume or Conte right
 like what would they have thought or Aristotle you know what would theythought about modern physics because
 they do in philosophy your predilections end up paint playing a much bigger rolein your ultimate conclusions cuz you're
 not as tied down by what the data is in physics you know physics is luckybecause we can't stray too far off the
 reservation as long as we're trying to explain the world that we actually seein our telescopes and microscopes but
 it's it's just not fair to play that game because the people were thinkingabout didn't know a whole bunch of
 things that we know right like we lived through a lot that they didn't livethrough so by the time we got them
 caught up they'd be different people so

Speaker 1 :let me ask a bunch of basic questions I
 think it would be interesting useful for people are not familiar but even forpeople who are extremely well familiar
 let's start with what is quantum

Speaker 0 :mechanics quantum mechanics is the
 paradigm of physics that came into being in the early part of the 20th centurythat replaced
 classical mechanics and it replaced classical mechanics in a weird way thatwe're still coming to terms with so in
 classical mechanics you have an object it as a location has a velocity and ifyou know the location and velocity of
 everything in the world you can say what everything's gonna do quantum mechanicshas an aspect of it that is kind of on
 the same lines there's something called a quantum state or the wave function andthere's an equation governing what the
 quantum state does so it's very much like classical mechanics the wavefunction is different it's sort of a
 wave it's a vector in a huge dimensional vector space rather than a position in avelocity but okay that's a detail and
 the equation is the Schrodinger equation not Newton's laws but okay again adetail where quantum mechanics really
 becomes weird and different is that there's a whole nother set of rules inour textbook formulation of quantum
 mechanics in addition to saying that there's a quantum state and it evolvesin time and all these new rules have to
 do with what happens when you look at the system when you observe it when youmeasure it in classical mechanics there
 were no rules about observing you just look at it and you see what's going onthat that was that right in quantum
 mechanics the way we teach it there's something profoundly fundamental aboutthe act of measurement or observation
 and the system dramatically changes its state even though it has a wave functionlike the electron in an atom is not
 orbiting in a circle as sort of spread out in a cloud when you look at it youdon't see that cloud when you look at it
 it looks like a particle with a location so it dramatically changes its stateright away and the effects of that
 change can be instantly seen and what the electron does next so that's theagain we need to be careful because we
 don't agree on what quantum mechanics says that's what I need to say like inthe textbook view etc right but in the
 textbook view quantum mechanics unlike any other theory of physics places uhgives a fundamental role to the act of


Speaker 1 :measurement so maybe even more basic
 what is an atom and what is an electron

Speaker 0 :sure this all came together you know in
 a few years around the turn of the last century right around the year 1900Adams predated then of course the word
 Adam goes back to the ancient Greeks but it was the chemists in the 1800's thatreally first got experimental evidence
 for atoms they realized you know that there were two different types of tinoxide and in these two different types
 of tin oxide there was exactly twice as much oxygen in one type as the other andlike why is that why is it all why is it
 never 1.5 times as much right and so Dalton said well it's because there are10 atoms and oxygen atoms and one form
 of tin oxide is one atom of tin and one atom of oxygen and the other is one atomobtained and two atoms of oxygen and on
 the basis of this is you know speculation a theory right a hypothesisbut then on the basis of that you make
 other predictions and the chemists became quickly convinced that atoms werereal the physicists took a lot longer to
 catch on but eventually they did and I mean Boltzmann who believed in atoms wasGod he had a really tough time his whole
 life because he worked in Germany where atoms were not popular they were popularin England but not in Germany and there


Speaker 1 :in general the idea of atoms is it's the
 most the smallest building block of the universe for for them that's the kind of

Speaker 0 :how the Greek idea but the chemists in
 the 1800's jumped the gun a little bit so these days in atom is the smallestbuilding block of a chemical element
 right hydrogen tin oxygen carbon whatever but we know that atoms can bebroken up further than that and that's
 what physicists discovered in the early 1900's Rutherford especially and and hiscolleagues so the atom that we think
 about now the cartoon is that picture you you always seen of a little nucleusand then electrons orbiting it like a
 little solar system and we now know the nucleus is made of protons and neutronsso the weight of the atom the mass is
 almost all in its nucleus protons and neutrons or something like 1,800 timesas heavy as electrons are electrons are
 much lighter but they're because they're lighter they give all the life to theatoms so when atoms get together combine
 chemically when electricity flows through a system it's all the electronsthat are doing all the work


Speaker 1 :and we're quantum mechanic steps in as
 you mentioned with position or velocity with classical mechanics and quantummechanics is modeling the behavior of
 the electron I mean you can model the behavior of anything but the electronbecause that's where the fun is


Speaker 0 :the electron was it was the biggest
 challenge right from the start yeah so

Speaker 1 :what's a wavefunction you said it's an
 interesting detail yeah but in any interpretation what is the wave function

Speaker 0 :in quantum mechanics well you know we
 had this idea from Rutherford that atoms look like little solar systems butpeople very quickly realize that can't
 possibly be right because if an electron is orbiting in a circle it will give offlight all the light that we have in this
 room comes from electrons zooming up and down and wiggling and that's whatelectromagnetic waves are and you can
 calculate how long would it take for the electron just to spiral into the nucleusand the answer is 10 to the minus 11
 seconds okay a hundred billions of a second so that's not rightmeanwhile people had realized that light
 which we understood from the 1800s was a wave had properties that were similar tothat of particles right this is Einstein
 and plunk and stuff like that so if something that we agree was a wave hadparticle-like properties then maybe
 something we think is a particle the electron has wave-like properties rightand so a bunch of people eventually came
 to the conclusion don't think about the electron as a little point particleorbiting in like a solar system think of
 it as a wave that is spread out they cleverly gave this the name the wavefunction which is the dopiest name in
 the world for one of the most profound things in the universe the there'sliterally you know a number at every
 point in space which is the value of the electrons wave function at that point

Speaker 1 :and there's only there's only one wave


Speaker 0 :function that yeah they eventually
 figured that out that took longer but when you have two electrons you do nothave a wave function for electron one in
 a wave function for electron two you have one combined wave function for bothof them and indeed as you say there's
 only one wave function for the entire universe at once and that's where this

Speaker 1 :beautiful dance
 can you say what is entanglement it seems one of the most fundamental ideas

Speaker 0 :of quantum again well let's temporarily
 buy into the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics and what that says isthat this wave function so it's very
 small outside the atom very big in the atombasically the wave function you take it
 and you square it you squared the number that gives you the probability ofobserving the system at that location so
 if you say that for two electrons there's only one wave function and thatwave function gives you the probability
 of observing both electrons at once doing something okay so maybe theelectron can be here or here here here
 and the other electron can also be there but we have a wave function setup wherewe don't know where either electron is
 going to be seen but we know they'll both be seen in the same place okay sowe don't know exactly what we're gonna
 see for either electron but there's entanglement between the two of themthere's a sort of conditional statement
 if we see one in one location then we know the other one's going to be doing acertain thing so that's a feature of
 quantum mechanics that is nowhere to be found in classical mechanics inclassical mechanics there's no way I can
 say well I don't know where either one of these particles is but if I know if Ifind out where this one is then I know
 where the other one is that just never happens they're truly separate and in

Speaker 1 :general it feels like if you think of a
 wave function like as a dance floor it seems like entanglement is strongestbetween things that are dancing together
 closest so there's a there's a closeness

Speaker 0 :that's important well that's not that
 that's another step we have to be careful here should cause in principleif you if you're talking my the
 entanglement of two electrons for examplethey can be totally entangled or totally
 unentangled no matter where they are in the universe there's no relationshipbetween the amount of entanglement and
 the distance between two electrons but we now know that you know the reality ofour best way of understanding the world
 is through quantum fields not through particles so even the electron not justgravity and electromagnetism but even
 the electron and the quarks and so forth are really vibrations in quantum fieldsso even empty space is full of vibrating
 quantum fields and those quantum fields in empty space are entangled with eachother in exactly the way you just said
 if they're nearby if you have like two vibrating quantum fields that are nearbythem it'll be highly entangled if
 they're far away they will not be

Speaker 1 :entangled so what do quantum fields in a
 vacuum look like empty space just so

Speaker 0 :like empty space it's as empty as it can


Speaker 1 :be but there's still a field it's just
 yeah it uh what is nothing just like

Speaker 0 :right here or this location in space
 there's a gravitational field which I can detach by dropping something yeah Idon't see it but there it is so we got a


Speaker 1 :little bit of idea of entanglement now


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :what is Hilbert space and Euclidean


Speaker 0 :space yeah you know I think that people
 are very welcoming over their lives not knowing what Hilbert space is but if youif you what I dig in a little bit more
 into quantum mechanics it becomes necessary you know the English languagewas invented long before quantum
 mechanics or various forms of higher mathematics were invented so we use theword space to mean different things of
 course most of us think of space as this three dimensional world in which we liveright I mean some of us just think of it
 as outer space okay but space around us it gives us the three-dimensionallocation of things and objects but
 mathematicians use any generic abstract collection ofelements as a space okay a space of
 possibilities you know momentum space etc so Hilbert space is the space of allpossible quantum wave functions either
 for the universe or for some specific systemand it could be an infinite dimensional
 space or it could be just really really large dimensional but finite we don'tknow because we don't know the final
 theory of everything but this abstract hilbert space is really really reallybig and has no immediate connection to
 the three-dimensional space in which we

Speaker 1 :live what what do dimensions in hilbert


Speaker 0 :space mean you know it's just a way of
 mathematically representing how much information is contained in the state ofthe system how many numbers do you have
 to give me to specify what the thing is doing so in classical mechanics I giveyou the location of something by giving
 you three numbers right up down left likes XYZ coordinates but then I mightwant to give you its entire state
 physical state which means both its position and also its velocity thevelocity also has three components so
 it's state lives in something called phase space which is six dimensionalthree dimensions of position three
 dimensions of velocity and then if it also has an orientation in space that'sanother three dimensions and so forth so
 as you describe more and more information about the system you have anabstract mathematical space that has
 more and more numbers that you need to give and each one of those numberscorresponds to a dimension in that space


Speaker 1 :so in terms of that amount of
 information what is entropy this mystical wordthat's overused in math and physics but
 has a very specific meaning in this

Speaker 0 :context sadly it has more than one very
 specific meeting this is this is reason why it is hard and roomy means differentthings even to different physicists but
 one way of thinking about it is a measure of how much we don't know aboutthe state of a system right so if I have
 a bottle of water molecules and I know that okay there's a certain number ofwater molecules I could weigh it right
 and figure out I know the volume of it and I know the temperature and pressureand things like that
 I certainly don't know the exact position and velocity of every watermolecule right so there's a certain
 amount of information I know certain amount that I don't know that is that ispart of the complete state of the system
 and that's what the entropy characterizes how much unknowninformation there is the difference
 between what I do know about the system and its full exact microscopic state so

Speaker 1 :when we try to describe
 a quantum mechanical system is infinite or finite but very large yeah we don't

Speaker 0 :know that depends on the system you know
 it's easy to mathematically write down a system that would have a potentiallyinfinite entropy an infinite dimensional
 hilbert space so let's let's go back a little bit we said that the hilbertspace was the space in which quantum
 wave functions lived for different systems that will be different sizesthey could be infinite or finite so
 that's the number of numbers the number of pieces information you couldpotentially give me about the system so
 the bigger hilbert spaces the bigger the entropy of that system could bedepending on what I know about it if I
 don't know anything about it then you know as a huge entropy right but only upto the size of its hilbert space so we
 don't know in in the real physical world whether or not you know this region ofspace that contains that water bottle
 has potentially an infinite entropy or just a finite entropy we have we havedifferent arguments on different sides


Speaker 1 :so if it's infinite how do you think
 about infinity is this something you can your cognitive abilities are able toprocess or is it just a mathematical


Speaker 0 :tool it's somewhere in between right I
 mean we can say things about it we can use mathematical tools to manipulateinfinity very very accurately we can
 define what we mean you know for any number n there's a number bigger than itso there's no biggest number right so
 there's something called the total number of all numbers that's infinitebut it is hard to wrap your brain around
 that and I think that gives people pause because we talk about infinity as ifit's a number but it has plenty of
 properties that real numbers don't have you know if you multiply infinity by 2you get infinity again right that's a
 little bit different than what we're

Speaker 1 :used to okay but are you comfortable
 with the idea that in thinking of what the real world actually is that infinitycould be part of that world
 are you comfortable that a world in some dimension and somehow comfortable with

Speaker 0 :lots of things I mean you know I don't
 want my level of comfort to affect what I think about the world you know I'mpretty open-minded about what the world
 could be at the fundamental level

Speaker 1 :yeah but infinity is a is a tricky one
 it's not almost a question of comfort it's a question of is it an overreach ofour intuition sort of it could be a
 convenient almost like when you add a constant to an equation just becauseit'll help it just feels like it's
 useful to at least be able to imagine a concept not directly but in some kind ofway that this feels like it's a
 description of the real world think of

Speaker 0 :it this way there's only three numbers
 that are simple there's zero there's one and there's infinity a number like 318it's just bizarre like that that you
 need a lot of bits to give me what that number is yeah but zero and one infinitylike once you have 300 things you might
 as well have infinity things right otherwise yet to say how when to stopmaking the thing that's right so there's
 a sense in which infinity is a very natural number of things to exist that I

Speaker 1 :was never comfortable with it because
 it's just such a kick but it was a too good to be true mmmbecause in math it just helps make
 things work out when things get very it's when things get very large close toinfinity things seem to work out nicely
 it's kind of like because of my deepest passion it's probably psychology and I'muncomfortable how in the average the the
 beauty of the very very the how much we vary is lost in that same kind of senseinfinity seems like convenient way to
 erase the details but the thing about

Speaker 0 :infinity is you it seems to pop up
 whether we like it or not right right like you're trying to be a computerscientist you ask yourself well how long
 will it take this program to run and you realize well for some of them the answeris infinitely long it's not because you
 tried to get there you wrote a five line computer programit doesn't halt so coming back to the


Speaker 1 :textbook definition of quantum mechanics
 this idea that we I don't think we talked about can you this one of themost interesting philosophical points we
 talked at the human level but at the at the physics level that it that atleast the textbook definition of quantum
 mechanics separates what is observed and what is real one how does that make youfeel and and two what does it then mean
 to observe something and why is it different that what is real yeah you

Speaker 0 :know I my personal feelings such as it
 is is that things like measurement and observers and stuff like that are notgoing to play a fundamental role in the
 ultimate laws of physics but my feeling that way is because so far that's whereall the evidence has been pointing I
 could be wrong and there's certainly a sense in which it would be infinitelycool if somehow observation or mental
 cogitation did play a fundamental role in the in the nature of reality but Idon't think so I can I don't see any
 evidence for it so I'm not spending a lot of time worrying about thatpossibility so what do you do about the
 fact that in the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics this idea ofmeasurement or looking at things seems
 to play an important role well you you come up with better interpretations ofquantum mechanics and there are several
 alternatives my favorite is the many-worlds interpretation which saystwo things number one you the observer
 are just a quantum system like anything else there's nothing special about youdon't get so proud of yourself you know
 you're just a bunch of atoms you have a wavefunction you obey the Schrodingerequation like everything else and number
 two when you think you're measuring something or observing something what'sreally happening is you're becoming
 entangled with that thing so when you think there's a wavefunction for theelectron it's all spread out but you
 look at it and you only see it in one location what's really happening is thatthere's still the wave functions the
 electron in all those locations but now it's entangled with the wave function ofyou in the following way there's part of
 the wave function that says the electron was here and you think you saw it therethe electron was there and you think you
 saw it there the electron was over there and you think you saw it there etc soand all of those different parts of the
 wave function once they come into being nolonger talk to each other they no longer
 interact or influence each other it says if they are separate worlds so this wasthe invention of Hugh Everett the third
 who was a graduate student at Princeton in the 1950s and he said basically lookyou don't need all these extra rules
 about looking at things just listen to what the Schrodinger equation is tellingyou it's telling you that you have a
 wavefunction that you become entangled and that the different versions of youno longer talk to each other so just
 accept it it's just he did therapy more than anything else you know he said likeit's okay you know you don't need all
 these extra rules all you need to do is believe the Schrodinger equation thecost is there's a whole bunch of extra
 worlds out there so how the worlds being

Speaker 1 :created whether there's an observer or
 not the worlds are created anytime a

Speaker 0 :quantum system that's in a superposition
 becomes entangled with the outside world

Speaker 1 :what's the outside world it depends


Speaker 0 :let's back out yeah
 whatever it really says what his theory is is there's a wave function of theuniverse
 and a base the Schrodinger equation all the time that's it that's the fulltheory right there okay the question all
 of the work is how in the world do you map that theory on to reality on to whatwe observe right so part of it is
 carving up the wavefunction into these separate worlds saying look look itdescribes a whole bunch of things that
 don't interact with each other let's call them separate worlds another partis distinguishing between systems and
 their environments and the environment is basically all the degrees of freedomall the things going on in the world
 that you don't keep track of so again in the bottle of water I might keep trackof the total amount of water and the
 volume I don't keep track of the individual positions and velocities Idon't keep track of all the photons or
 the air molecules in this room so that's the outside world the outside world isall the parts of the universe that
 you're not keeping track of when you're asking about the behavior of somesubsystem of it so how many worlds are


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :there you want to know that one either
 there could be an infinite number there could be only a finite number but it's abig number one way or the other it's a


Speaker 1 :very very big number
 one of you talked somebody asked well if it's a if it's finiteso actually I'm not sure exactly the
 logic you used to derive this but is there you know going to be the you know

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :overlap a duplicate world that you
 return to so you've mentioned and I'd love if you can elaborate on sort ofidea that it's possible that there's
 some kind of equilibrium that these splitting worlds arrive at and thenmaybe over time maybe somehow connected
 to entropy you get a large number of worlds they're very similar to each

Speaker 0 :other yeah so this question of whether
 or not Hilbert space is finite or infinite dimensional is actuallysecretly connected to gravity and
 cosmology this is a the part that we're still struggling to understand right nowbut we discovered back in 1998 that our
 universe is accelerating and what that means if it continues which we think itprobably will but we're not sure but if
 it does that means there's a horizon around us there there's because theuniverse not only expanding but
 expanding faster and faster things can get so far away from us that from ourperspective it looks like they're moving
 away faster than the speed of light you'll never see them againso there's literally a horizon around us
 and that horizon approaches some fixed distance away from us and you can thenargue that within that horizon there's
 only a finite number of things that can possibly happen the finite dimensionalhilbert space in fact we even have a
 guess for what the dimensionality is it's 10 to the power of 10 to the powerof 122 that's a very large number yes
 just to compare the age of the universe is something like 10 to the 14 seconds10 to the 17 or 18 seconds maybe the
 number of particles in the universe is 10 to the 88th but the number ofdimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the
 10 to the 120 - so that's just crazy thing if that story is right that in ourobservable horizon there's only a finite
 dimensional hilbert space then this idea of branching of the wavefunction theuniverse into multiple distinct separate
 branches has to reach a limit at once you read branched that many timesyou've run out of room in hilbert space
 and roughly speaking that corresponds to the universe just expanding and emptyingout and cooling off and and entering a
 phase where it's just empty space literally forever what's the difference

Speaker 1 :between splitting and copying do you
 think like in terms of a lot of this is an interpretation that's that helps ussort of model the world so perhaps
 shouldn't be thought of as like you know philosophically or metaphysically but ineven at the physics level do you see a
 difference between two generating new copies of the world or splitting I think

Speaker 0 :it's better to think of in quantum
 mechanics in many worlds the universe splits rather than new copies becausepeople otherwise worry about things like
 energy conservation and no one who understands quantum mechanics worriesabout energy conservation because the
 equation is perfectly clear but if all you know is that someone told you theuniverse duplicates then you have a
 reasonable worry about where all the energy for that came from so apre-existing universe splitting into two
 skinnier universes is a better way of thinking about it and mathematicallyit's just like you know if you draw an x
 and y axis and you draw a vector of length 1 45-degree angleyou you know that you can write that
 vector of length 1 as the sum of two vectors pointing along x and y of length1 over the square root of 2 ok
 so I write one arrow as the sum of two arrows but there's a conservation of airOnis right like if now two arrows but
 the length is the same I just I'm describing it in a different way andthat's exactly what happens when the
 universe branches the the wave function of the universe is a big old vector so

Speaker 1 :to somebody who brings up a question of
 saying doesn't this violate the conservation of energy can you givefurther elaboration right so let's just


Speaker 0 :be SuperDuper perfectly clear yeah
 there's zero question about whether or not many-worlds violates conservation ofenergy yes it does not great and I say
 this definitively because there are other questionsI think there's answers too but they're
 legitimate questions right about you know where does probability come fromand things like that this conservation
 of energy question we know the answer to it and the answer to it is that energyis conserved all of the effort goes into
 how best to translate what the equation unambiguously says into think plainEnglish right
 so this idea that there's a universe that has that that the universe comesequipped with a thickness and it sort of
 divides up into thinner pieces but the total amount of universe is is conservedover time is a reasonably good way of
 putting English words to the underlying mathematics so one of my favorite things

Speaker 1 :about many worlds is I mean I love that
 there's something controversial in science and for some reason it makespeople actually not like upset but just
 get excited why do you think it is a controversial idea so there's there's alot of it's actually one of the cleanest
 ways to think about quantum mechanics yeah so why do you think there's adiscomfort a little bit among certain
 people

Speaker 0 :well I draw the distinction of my book
 between two different kinds of simplicity in a physical theory there'ssimplicity in the theory itself right
 how we describe what's going on according to the theory by its ownrights but then you know a theory is
 just some sort of abstract mathematical formalism you have to map it onto theworld somehow right and sometimes like
 for Newtonian physics it's pretty obvious like okay here is a bottle andas a center of mass and things like that
 sometimes it's a little bit harder with general relativity curvature ofspace-time is a little bit harder to
 grasp quantum mechanics is very hard to map what you're the language you'retalking into wave functions and things
 like that on to reality and many worlds is the version of quantum mechanicswhere it is hardest to map on the
 underlying formalism to reality so that's where the lack of simplicitycomes in not in the theory but in how we
 use the theory to map on to reality and in fact all of the work in sort ofelaborating many-worlds quantum
 mechanics is in the this effort to map it on to the world that we see soit's perfectly legitimate to be bugged
 by that right to say like well no that's just too far away from my experience I Iam therefore intrinsically skeptical of
 it of course you should give up on that skepticism if there are no alternativesand this theory always keeps working
 then eventually you should overcome your skepticism but right now there arealternatives and that are that you know
 people work to make alternatives that are by their nature closer to what weobserve directly can you describe the


Speaker 1 :alternatives I don't think we touched on
 it so the the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worldsmaybe there's a difference between the
 effort I've already in many worlds and many worlds it is now like has the ideasort of developed and so on and just in
 general what is the space of promising contenderswe have democratic debates now there's a


Speaker 0 :bunch of candidate well family of
 candidates on stage what are the

Speaker 1 :quantum-mechanical candidates on stage


Speaker 0 :for the debate so if you had a debate
 between quantum-mechanical contenders there would be no problem getting 12people up there on stage but there would
 still be only three frontrunners and right now the frontrunners would beEvert hidden variable theories are
 another one so the hidden variable theories say that the wavefunction isreal but there's something in addition
 to the wave function the wave function is not everything is part of reality butit's not everything what else is there
 we're not for but in the simplest version of the theory there areliterally particles so many world says
 that quantum systems are sometimes are wave-like in some ways and particle-likein another because they really really
 are waves but under certain observational circumstances they looklike particles whereas invariable says
 there they look like waves and particles because there are both waves andparticles involved in the dynamics and
 that's easy to do if your particles are just nonrelativistic Newtonian particlesmoving around they get pushed around by
 the wave function roughly it becomes much harder when you take quantum fieldtheory or quantum gravity into account
 the other big contender are spontaneous collapse theoriesso in the conventional textbook
 interpretation we say when you look at a quantum system its wavefunctioncollapses and you see it in one location
 a spontaneous collapse theory says that every particle has a chance per secondof having its wavefunction spontaneously
 collapse the chance is very small for a typical particle it will take hundredsof millions of years before it happens
 even once but in a table or some macroscopic object there are way morethan a hundred million particles and
 they're all entangled with each other so when one of them clacks it collapses itbrings everything else along with it
 there's a slight variation of this that's a spontaneous collapse theorythere are also induced collapse theories
 like Roger Penrose thinks that when the gravitational difference between twoparts of the wave function becomes too
 large the wavefunction collapses automatically so those are basically inmy mind the three big alternatives many
 worlds which is just there's a wave function and always a basis reading yourequation hidden variables there's a wave
 function that always the basis Schrodinger equation but there are alsonew variables or collapse theories which
 the wave function sometimes obeys the Schrodinger equation and sometimes itcollapses so you can see that the
 alternatives are more complicated in their formalism than many-worlds is butthey are closer to our experience so


Speaker 1 :just this moment of collapse do you
 think of it as so is a wave function fundamentally sort of a probabilisticdescription of the world and its
 collapse sort of reducing that part of the world into something deterministicor again you can now describe the
 position in the velocity in this simple classical model well there is a hardthing about collapse there is a fourth


Speaker 0 :category is a 4th contender there's a
 mayor Pete of quantum mechanical interpretations which are calledepistemic interpretations and what they
 say is all the wavefunction is is a way of making predictions for experimentaloutcomes it's not mapping on to an
 element of reality in any real sense and in fact two different people might havetwo different wave functions for the
 same physical system because they know different things about it right the wavefunction is really just a prediction
 mechanism and then the problem with those epistemic interpretations is ifyou say okay
 but it's predicting about what like what is the thing that is being predicted andI say no no that's not what we're here
 for we're just here to tell you what theobservational outcomes are gonna be but


Speaker 1 :the other the other interpretation is
 kind of think that the wavefunction is

Speaker 0 :real yes that's right so that's an antic
 interpretation of the wavefunction ontology being the study of what is realwhat exists as opposed to an epistemic
 interpretation of the wavefunction epistemology being the study what we

Speaker 1 :know now actually just love to see that
 debate on stage there was a version of

Speaker 0 :it on stage at the world science
 festival a few years ago that you can look up online I need youyep that's all you do okay awesome I'll


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :link it and watch it anyone I won there
 was no vote those there's Brian Greene was the moderator and David Albert stoodup for spontaneous collapse and Shelley
 Goldstein was there for hidden variables and Ruettiger shock was there forepistemic approaches why do you I think


Speaker 1 :you mentioned it but just why do you
 find many worlds so compelling well

Speaker 0 :there's two reasons actually one is like
 I said it is the simplest right it's like the most bare-bones austere pureversion of quantum mechanics and I am
 someone who is very willing to put a lot of work into mapping the formalism ontoreality I'm less willing to complicate
 the formalism itself but the other big reason is that there's something calledmodern physics with quantum fields and
 quantum gravity and holography and space-time doing things like that andwhen you take any of the other versions
 of quantum theory they bring along classical baggage all of the otherversions of quantum mechanics prejudice
 or privilege some version of classical reality like locations in space okay andI think that that's a barrier to doing
 better at understanding the theory of everything and understanding quantumgravity and the emergence of space-time
 whenever if you change your theory from you know here's a harmonic oscillator ohthere's a spin here's an electromagnetic
 field in hidden variable theories or dynamical collapse theories you have tostart from scratch
 what are the hidden variables for this theory or how does he collapse orwhatever
 whereas many-worlds is plug-and-play you tell me the theory and I can give you asmany worlds version so when we have a
 situation like we have with gravity and space-time where the classicaldescription seems to break down in a
 dramatic way then I think you should start from the most quantum theory thatyou have which is really many worlds so


Speaker 1 :start with the quantum theory and try to
 build up a model of space-time the emergence of space-time that's okay so Ithought space-time was fundamental yeah


Speaker 0 :I know so this sort of dream that


Speaker 1 :Einstein had that everybody had and
 everybody has of you know the theory of everything so how do we build up frommany worlds from quantum mechanics a
 model of space-time model of gravity

Speaker 0 :well yeah I mean let me first mention
 very quickly why we think it's necessary you know we've had gravity in the formthat Einstein bequeathed it to us for
 over a hundred years now like 1915 or 1916 he put generalrelativity in the final form so gravity
 is the curvature of space-time and there's a field that pervades all theuniverse that tells us how curved


Speaker 1 :space-time is and that's a fundamentally
 classical that's totally classical right

Speaker 0 :exactly but we also have a formalism an
 algorithm for taking a classical theory and quantizing it this is how we getquantum electrodynamics for example and
 it could be tricky I mean you think your quantizing something so that meanstaking a classical theory and promoting
 it to a quantum mechanical theory but you can run into problems so they raninto problems and you did that with
 electromagnetism namely that certain quantities were infinity and you don'tlike infinity right so Fineman and
 tominaga and Schwinger won the nobel prize for teaching us how to deal withthe infinities and then Ken Wilson won
 another Nobel Prize for saying you shouldn't have been worried about thoseinfinities after all but still that was
 the it's always the thought that that's how you will make a good quantum theoryyou'll start with the classical theory
 and quantize it so if we have a classical theory general relativity wecan quantize it or we can try to but we
 run into even bigger problems with gravity than we ran into withelectromagnetism and so far those
 problems are we've not been able to get a successfultheory of gravity quantum gravity by
 starting with classical general relativity and quantum it and there'sevidence that there's a good reason why
 this is true that the whatever the quantum theory of gravity is it's not afield theory it's something that has
 weird non-local features built into it somehow that we don't understand and weget this idea from black holes and
 Hawking radiation and information conservation and a whole bunch of otherideas I talked about in the book so if
 that's true if the fundamental theory isn't even local in the sense that anordinary quantum field theory would be
 then we just don't know where to start in terms of getting a classicalprecursor and quantizing so the only
 sensible thing is at least the next obvious sensible thing to me would be tosay okay let's just start intrinsically
 quantum and work backwards see if we can find a classical limit so the idea of

Speaker 1 :locality the the fact that locality is


Speaker 0 :not fundamental to the nature of our


Speaker 1 :existence sort of you know I guess in
 that sense modeling everything's the field makes sense to me stuff that'sclose by interact stuff that's far away
 doesn't so what's what's locality and why is it not fundamental and how isthat even possible


Speaker 0 :yeah I mean locality is the answer to
 the question that Isaac Newton was worried about back in the beginning ofour conversation right I mean how can
 the earth know what the gravitational field of the Sun is when the answer hasspelled out by Laplace and Einstein and
 others is that there's a field in between and the way a field works isthat what's happening to the field at
 this point in space only depends directly on what's happening at pointsright next to it but what's happening at
 those points depends on what's happening right next to those right is you canbuild up an influence across space
 through only local interactions that's what locality means what happens here isonly affected by what's happening right
 next to it that's locality the idea of locality is built into every fieldtheory including general relativity as a
 classical theory it seems to break down when we talk about black holes and youknow Hawking taught us in the 1970s the
 black holes radiate they give off they'll eventually evaporate awaythey're not
 completely black once we take quantum mechanics into account and we think wedon't know for sure but most of us think
 that if you make a black hole out of certain stuff then like Laplace's Demontaught us you should be able to predict
 what that black hole will turn into if it's just obeying the Schrodingerequation and if that's true there are
 good arguments that can't happen while preserving locality at the same timeit's just that their information seems
 to be spread out non locally in

Speaker 1 :interesting ways and people should you
 talk about holography with the Leonard Susskind on your - a podcast

Speaker 0 :yes I have a podcast I didn't even
 mention that I'm terrible no I'm gonna

Speaker 1 :I'm gonna ask you questions about that
 too and I've been not shutting up about it's my favorite science podcast so ornot it's a famous science podcast it's
 like it's a scientist doing absolutely

Speaker 0 :yes yeah anyway yeah so holography is
 this idea when you have a black hole and black hole is a region of space insideof which gravity is so strong that you
 can't escape and there's this weird feature of black holes that again is atotally a thought experiment feature cuz
 we haven't gone and probed any yet but there seems to be one way of thinkingabout what happens inside a black hole
 as seen by an observer who's falling in which is actually pretty normal likeeverything looks pretty normal until you
 get the singularity and you die but from the point of the view of the outsideobserver it seems like all the
 information that that fell in is actually smeared over the horizon in anon-local way and that's puzzling and
 that's a lot so holography because that's a two-dimensional surface that isencapsulating the whole
 three-dimensional thing inside right still trying to deal with that stilltrying to figure out how to get there
 but it's an indication that we need to think a little more subtly when wequantize gravity so because you can


Speaker 1 :describe everything that's going on in
 the in three-dimensional space by looking at the two-dimensionalprojection of it that means that
 locality doesn't it's not necessary well

Speaker 0 :it means it's somehow it's only a good
 approximation it's not really what's going on how we're supposed to feel

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :about that supposed to be liberated
 you know space is just a good approximation and this was always gonnabe true once you started quantizing
 gravity so we're just beginning now to face up to the dramatic implications ofquantizing gravity is there other weird


Speaker 1 :stuff that happens to quantum mechanics
 in black hole I don't think that

Speaker 0 :anything weird happen with quantum
 mechanics thinking weird things happen with space-time I mean that's what it islike quantum mechanics is still just
 quantum mechanics but our ordinary notions of space-time don't really quitework and there's a principle that goes
 hand in hand with holography called complementarity which says that there'sno one unique way to describe what's
 going on inside a black hole different observers will have differentdescriptions both of which are accurate
 but sound completely incompatible with each other so depends on how you look atit you know the word complementarity in
 this context is borrowed from Niels Bohr who points out you can measure theposition or you can measure the momentum
 you can't measure both at the same time in quantum mechanics so a couple

Speaker 1 :questions on many worlds how does many
 worlds help us understand our particular branch of reality so ok that's fine andgood that is everything is splitting
 we're just traveling down a single branch of it so how does it help usunderstand our little unique branch yeah


Speaker 0 :I mean that's a great question but
 that's the point is that we didn't invent many worlds cuz you thought itwas cool to have a whole bunch of worlds
 right we invented it because we were trying to account for what we observehere in our world and what we observe
 here in our world are wave functions collapsing ok we do have a position as asituation where the electron seems to be
 spread out but then when we look at it we don't see it spread out we see itlocated somewhere so what's going on
 that's the measurement problem of quantum mechanics that's what we have toface up to so many worlds is just a
 proposed solution to that problem and the answer is nothing special ishappening it's still just the
 Schrodinger equation but you have a wave function - and that's a different answerthan would be given in hidden variables
 or dynamical collapse theories or whatever so the entire point of manyworld's is to explain what we observe
 but it tries to explain what we already have observed right it's not trying tobe different from what we've observed
 because that would be something other than quantum mechanics but you know the

Speaker 1 :idea that there's worlds that we didn't
 observe they keep branching off it's kind of it is uh you know it'sstimulating to the imagination so is it
 possible to hop from you mentioned the branches are independent yes is itpossible to hop from one to the other
 no it's so physical limit then the theory says it's impossible there's

Speaker 0 :already a copy of you in the other world
 don't worry yes leave them alone

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :no but there's a there's a fear of


Speaker 1 :missing out form oh yes that I feel like
 immediately start to wander if that other copy is having more or less fun

Speaker 0 :well the downside in many worlds is that
 you're missing out on an enormous and that's always what it's gonna be like

Speaker 1 :and I mean there's a certain stage of
 acceptance and that yes in terms of rewinding you think we can rewind thesystem back sort of the the nice thing
 about many worlds I guess is it really emphasizes the maybe you can correct mebut to determine it the deterministic
 nature of a branch and it feels like it could be a while back is it is do yousee is this something that could be
 perfectly won back rewinded back yeah

Speaker 0 :you know if you're at a fancy French
 restaurant yeah there's a nice linen white tablecloth and you have your glassof Bordeaux and you knock it over and
 the wine spills across the tablecloth if the world were classical okay it wouldbe possible that if you just lifted the
 wine glass up you'd be lucky enough that every molecule of wine would hop backinto the glass right but guess what it's
 not going to happen in the real world and the quantum wave function is exactlythe same way it is possible in principle
 to rewind everything if you start from perfect knowledge of the entire wavefunction of the universe in practice
 that's never gonna happen

Speaker 1 :so time travel not possible


Speaker 0 :nope at least one mechanic says no help


Speaker 1 :what about memory does the universe have
 a memory of itself where we could in in it's a not time travel but peek back intime and do a little like replay well


Speaker 0 :it's exactly the same in quantum
 mechanics as classical mechanics so whatever you want to say about that youknow the fundamental laws of physics in
 either many worlds quantum mechanics or Newtonian physics conserve informationso if you have all the information about
 the quantum state of the world right now your Laplace's demon-like in yourknowledge and calculational capacity you
 can wind the clock backward but none of us is right and you know so in practiceyou could never do that you can do
 experiments over and over again starting from the same initial conditions forsmall systems but once things get to be
 large Avogadro's number of particles write bigger than a cell no chance we

Speaker 1 :we've talked a little bit about arrow of
 time last time but in many worlds that there is a kind of implied arrow of timeright so you've talked about the arrow
 of time that has to do with the second law of thermodynamicsthat's the arrow of time that's emergent
 or fundamental we don't know I guess

Speaker 0 :no it's emergent it's a is that there's


Speaker 1 :everyone agree on that well nobody's


Speaker 0 :everything so that area of time is that


Speaker 1 :different in the arrow of time that's
 implied by many worlds it's not

Speaker 0 :different actually no in both cases you
 have fundamental laws of physics that are completely reversible if you give methe state of the universe at one moment
 in time I can run the clock forward or backward equally well there's no arrowof time built into the laws of physics
 at the most fundamental level but what we do have are special initialconditions 14 billion years ago near the
 Big Bang in thermodynamics those special initial conditions take the form ofthings were low entropy and entropy has
 been increasing ever since making the universe more disorganized and chaoticand that's the arrow of time in quantum
 mechanics these special initial conditions take the form of there wasonly one branch of the wavefunction and
 the universe has been branching more and

Speaker 1 :more ever since ok so if time is
 emergent so it seems like our human cognitive capacity likes to take thingsthat are emergent and assume in feel
 like they're fundamental so what it sequence of times emergent and localitylike space emergent yes ok but I didn't


Speaker 0 :say time was merge and I said the arrow
 of time was emergent those are different

Speaker 1 :what's the difference between the arrow
 of time and time are using arrow of time to simply mean this the synonymous withthe second law thermodynamics no but the


Speaker 0 :arrow of time is the difference between
 the past and future so all right there's space but there's no arrow of space youdon't feel that space has to have an
 arrow right you could live in thermodynamic equilibrium there be noarrow of time but there'd still be time
 it'd still be a difference between now and the future also ok so if nothing

Speaker 1 :changes there's still time well things


Speaker 0 :could even change like if the whole
 universe consisted of the earth going around the Sun yeah ok it would just goin circles or ellipses right that's not
 every things would change but it's not increasing entropy there's no arrow ifyou took a movie of that and I played
 you the movie backward you would never know so the arrow of time can

Speaker 1 :theoretically point in the other
 direction for brief briefly so intent

Speaker 0 :that it points in different directions
 it's not a very good arrow I mean the arrow of time in the macroscopic worldis so powerful that there's just no
 chance of going back when you get down to tiny systems with only three or fourmoving parts then entropy can fluctuate
 up and down what does it mean for space

Speaker 1 :to be an emergent phenomena it means


Speaker 0 :that the fundamental description of the
 world does not include the word space it'll be something like a vector inHilbert space right and you have to say
 well why is there a good approximation scription which involves three dementiaspace and stuff inside it okay so time


Speaker 1 :and space or immersion we kind of
 mentioned it in the beginning but can you elaborate what do you feel hope isfundamental in our universe a


Speaker 0 :wavefunction living in hilbert space


Speaker 1 :wave function and hilbert space that we
 can't intellectualize or visualize really

Speaker 0 :we can't visualize it we can
 intellectualize it very easily like well

Speaker 1 :how do you think about it's a vector in


Speaker 0 :a 10 to the 10 to the 120 2-dimensional
 vector space it's a complex vector unit norm it evolves according theSchrodinger equation got it when you put


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :it that way what's so hard really yep


Speaker 1 :quantum computers there's some
 excitement actually a lot of excitement with people that it will allow us tosimulate quantum mechanical systems what
 kind of questions do about quantum mechanics about the things we've beentalking about do you think do you hope
 we can answer through quantum simulation

Speaker 0 :well I think that there are there's a
 whole fascinating frontier of things you can do with quantum computers both sortof practical things with cryptography or
 money privacy eavesdropping sorting things simulating quantum systems right

Speaker 1 :so it's a it's a broader question maybe
 even outside of quantum computers some of the theories that we've been talkingabout what's your hope what's most
 promising to test these theories what are what are kind of experiments we canconduct whether in simulation or in the
 physical world that would validate or disprove or expand these theories well I

Speaker 0 :think for the there's two parts of that
 question one is many worlds and the other one is sort of emergent space-timefor many worlds you know there are
 experiments on going to test whether or not wavefunction spontaneously collapseand if they do then that rules out many
 worlds and that will be falsified what if there are hidden variables there's atheorem that seems to indicate that the
 predictions will always be the same as many worlds I'm a little skeptical thistheorem I'm not completely I haven't
 internalized it haven't made it in part of my intuitive view of the world yet sothere might be loopholes to that theorem
 I'm not sure about that I part of me thinks that there should be differentexperimental predictions if there are
 hidden variables but I'm not sure but otherwise it's just quantum mechanicsall the way down and so there's there's
 this cottage industry in science journalism of writing breathlessarticles that say you know quantum
 mechanics shown to be more astonishing than ever before thought and really it'sthe same quantum mechanics we've been
 doing since 1926 whereas with the emergent space-time stuff we know a lotless about what the theory is it's in a
 very primitive state we don't even really have a safely written downrespectable honest theory yet so there
 could very well be experimental predictions we just don't know about yetthat is one of the things that we're
 trying to figure out me before emergence

Speaker 1 :space-time you need a really big stuff
 all right

Speaker 0 :well or really fast stuff or really
 energetic stuff we don't know that that's the thing you know so there couldbe violations of the speed of light if
 you have a version space-time not going faster than the speed of light but thespeed of light could be different for
 light of different wavelengths right that would be a dramatic violation ofphysics as we know it but it could be
 possible or not I mean it's not an absolutely prediction as that's that'sthe problem the theories are just not
 well developed enough yet to say is

Speaker 1 :there anything that quantum mechanics
 can teach us about human nature or the human mind do you think about sort ofconsciousness and these kinds of topics
 is there it's certainly excessively used as you point out the word quantum isused for everything besides quantum
 mechanics but in more seriousness is there something that goes to the humanlevel and can help us understand our


Speaker 0 :mind not really is the short answer
 you know minds are pretty classical I don't think we don't know this for surebut I don't think that phenomena like
 entanglement are crucial to how the human mind works or about consciousness

Speaker 1 :so you mentioned I think early on in the
 Commerce you said it would be I'm a it would beunlikely but incredible if sort of the
 observer somehow a fundamental part yeah so observer not to romanticize thenotion but seems interlink to the idea
 of consciousness so if consciousness as the pant site because believe isfundamental to the universe is that
 possible is that wait I mean every possible just say Joe Rogan likes to sayit's entirely possible but ok but is it
 on a spectrum of crazy out there how how

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :the statistic is speaking how often do
 you ponder the possibility that consciousness is fundamental or theobserver is fundamental to personally


Speaker 0 :don't at all there are people who do I'm
 a thorough physical estate company side I do not think that there are anyseparate mental states or mental
 properties I think they're all emergent just like space-time is and you knowspace-time is hard enough to understand
 so the fact that we don't yet understand consciousness is not at all surprisingto you as we mentioned have an amazing


Speaker 1 :podcast called mindscape it's as I said
 on my favorite podcast sort of both for your explanation of physics which a lotof people of and when you venture out
 into things that are beyond your expertise but it's just a really smartperson exploring even questions like you
 know morality for example it's very interesting I think you did a soloepisode and so on I mean there's a lot
 of really interesting conversations that you have what are what are some frommemory amazing conversations that pop to
 mind you've had what did you learn from them something that maybe changed yourmind and just inspired you or just what
 do this whole experience of having conversations what stands out to you

Speaker 0 :it's an unfair question totally unfair
 that's okay that's alright you know it's often the ones I feel like the the onesI do on physics and closely related
 science or even philosophy ones are like I know this stuff and I'mhelping people learn about it but I
 learned more from the ones that nothing to do with physics or philosophy rightso talking to Wynton Marsalis about jazz
 or talking to a Master Sommelier about wine talking to will Wilkinson aboutpartisan polarization and the
 urban-rural divide talking to psychologists like Carol Tavarez aboutcognitive dissonance and and how those
 things work scott derrickson who is the director of the movie dr. strange I hada wonderful conversation with him where
 we went through the mechanics of making a blockbuster superhero movie right andhe's also not a naturalist he's a he's a
 evangelical Christian so we talked about the nature of reality there I want tohave a couple more you know
 discussions with highly educated theists who know thetheology really well but I haven't quite
 arranged those yet I would love to hear

Speaker 1 :that I mean that's how comfortable are
 you venturing into questions of religion

Speaker 0 :well I'm totally comfortable doing it
 you know I did talk with Alan Lightman who is also an atheist but he he istrying to rescue the sort of spiritual
 side of things for atheism and I did talk to very vocal atheists like AlexRosenberg so I need to talk to some I
 talked to some religious believers and he talked more how have you changed

Speaker 1 :through having all these conversations


Speaker 0 :you know part of the motivation was I
 had a long stack of books that I hadn't read and I couldn't find time to readthem and I figured if I interviewed
 their authors forcing me to read them right and that's that is totally workedby the way now I'm annoyed that people
 write such long books I think I'm still very much learning how to be a goodinterviewer I think that's a skill that
 uh you know I I think I have good questions but you know there's thegive-and-take that is still I think I
 could be better at like I want to offer something to the conversation but nottoo much right I've had conversations
 where I barely talked at all and I have conversations where I talked half thetime I think there's a happy medium in
 between there so I think I remember

Speaker 1 :listening to without mentioning names
 some of your conversations where I wish you would have disagreed more yeah as alistener
 it's more fun sometimes it well this is

Speaker 0 :that's a very good question because you
 know my everyone has an attitude toward that like some people are really thereto basically give their point of view
 and the they're their guest is supposed to you know respond accordingly I I wantto sort of get my view on the record but
 I don't want to dwell on it when I'm talking to someone like David Chalmerswho I disagree with a lot you know I
 want to say like here's why I disagree with you but you know I want we're hereto listen to you like I have a Pepa
 sowed every week and you only own once a week right and so I have enough comingpodcast episode with Philip golf who is
 much more dedicated pants I kissed and sothere we really get into it I think that
 I probably have disagreed with him more on that episode than I ever have withanother podcast guest but that's what he
 wanted so it worked very well yes yeah

Speaker 1 :that kind of debate structure is
 beautiful when it's done right like when you're when you can detect that theintent is that you have fundamental
 respect for the person yeah that and that's for some reason it's super fun tolisten to when two really smart people
 are just arguing and sometimes lose their a little bit if I may say

Speaker 0 :well there's a fine line because I have
 zero interest in bringing I mean like I mean it may be maybe you implied this Ihave zero interest in bringing on people
 for whom I don't have any intellectual respect like I constantly get requestslike you know bring on a flat earth or
 whatever and really slap them down or a creationist like I'm at zero interestI'm happy to bring on you know a
 religious person a believer but I want someone who's smart and can act in goodfaith and can talk not a charlatan or a
 lunatic right so I will only I will happily bring on people with whom Idisagree but only people from who I
 think the audience can learn something

Speaker 1 :interesting so let me ask the idea of
 Charlton is an interesting idea you might be more educated on this topicthan me but there's um there's folks for
 example who argue of various aspects of evolution sort of try to approach andsay that evolution sort of our current
 theory of evolution has many holes in it as many flaws and they argue that Ithink like Cambridge
 Cambrian explosion that which is like a huge added variability of speciesdoesn't make sense under our current
 description of evolution to a theory of evolution sort of if you had were tohave the conversation with people like
 that how do you know that they're thedifference being outside the box
 thinkers and people who are fundamentally unscientific andeven bordering on charlatans it's a


Speaker 0 :great question and you know the further
 you get away from my expertise the harder it is for me to really judgeexactly those things and you know yeah I
 don't have a satisfying answer for that one because I think the example you useof someone who you know believes in the
 basic structure of natural selection but thinks that you know this particularthing cannot be understood in the terms
 of our current understanding of Darwinismthat's a perfect edge case where it's
 hard to tell right and I would have to I would try to talk to people who I dorespect and who do know things and I
 would have to you know given that I'm a physicist I know that physicists willsometimes be too dismissive of
 alternative points of view I have to take into account that biologists canalso be too dismissive of alternative
 points of view so yeah that's a tricky one have you gotten heat yet yeah allthe time like there's always something I
 mean it's it's hilarious cuz I do have I try very hard not to like have the sametopic several times in a row I did have
 like to climate change episodes but they were from very different perspectivesbut I like to mix it up that's the whole
 puzzle I'm having fun and every time I do an episode someone says oh the personyou should really get on to talk about
 exactly that is this other person like well I don't but I did that now I wantto do that well I hope you keep doing it


Speaker 1 :you're inspiring millions of people your
 books your podcasts Sean it's an honor to talk to you thank you so much thanks
