Speaker 0 :friedman and now here's my conversation


Speaker 1 :with chi foo lee
 I emigrated from Russia to US when I was 13you emigrated to us at about the same
 age the Russian people the American people the Chinese people each have acertain soul a spirit that permeates
 throughout the generations so maybe it's a little bit of a poetic question butcould you describe your sense of what


Speaker 0 :defines the Chinese soul I think the
 Chinese soul of people today right we're talking about people who have hadcenturies of burden because of the
 poverty that the country has gone through and suddenly shined with hope ofprosperity in the past 40 years as China
 opened up and embraced market economy and undoubtedly there are two sets ofpressures on the people that of the
 tradition that of facing difficult situations and that of Hope of wantingto be the first to become successful and
 wealthy so that it's a very strong a hunger and strong desire and strong work

Speaker 1 :ethic that drives China forward and is
 their roots to not just this generation but before that's that's deeper thanjust the new economic development is
 there something that's unique to China that you could speak to that's in thepeople yeah


Speaker 0 :well the Chinese some tradition is about
 excellence dedication and results and the Chinese exams and study subjects inschools have traditionally started from
 memorizing ten thousand characters not an easy taskto start with and further by memorizing
 his historic philosophers literature poetry so it really is the probably thestrongest rote learning mechanism
 created to make sure people had good memory and remembered things extremelywell that's I think at the same time
 suppresses the breakthrough innovation and also enhancesthe speed execution get results and that
 I think characterizes the historic basis serve on China that's interesting

Speaker 1 :because there's echoes of that and
 Russian education as well as rote memorization to memorize a lot of pocheI mean there's just the emphasis on
 perfection in all forms mmm that's not conducive to perhaps what you'respeaking to which is creativity but you
 and you think that kind of education holds back the innovative spirit thatyou might see in the United States well


Speaker 0 :it holds back the breakthrough
 innovative spirits that we see in the United States but it does not hold backthe valuable execution oriented
 result-oriented value creating engines which we see China being very successful

Speaker 1 :so is there a difference between a
 Chinese AI engineer today and an American AI engineer perhaps rooted inthe culture that we just talked about or
 the education or the very soul of the people or no and what would your advicebe to each if there's a difference well


Speaker 0 :there's a lot that's similar because AI
 is about mastering Sciences about using known technologies and trying new thingsbut it's also about picking from many
 parts of possible networks to use and different types of parameters to tuneand that part is somewhat rote and it is
 also as anyone who's built AI products can tell you a lot about cleansing thedata because AI runs better with more
 data and data is generally unstructured error error fall and unclean and theeffort to clean the data is is immense
 so I think the better part of American engineering ai engineering process is totry new things to do things people
 haven't done before and to use technology to solve most if not allproblems so to make the algorithm work
 despite not so great data find you know error tolerant ways to deal with thedata the Chinese way would be
 - basically enumerate to the fullest extent all the possible ways by a lot ofmachines try lots of different ways to
 get it to work and spend a lot of resources and money and time cleaning updata that mean that means the AI
 engineer may be writing data cleansing algorithms working with thousands ofpeople who label or correct or do things
 with the data that is the incredible hard work that might lead to betterresults so the Chinese engineer would
 rely on and ask for more and more and more data and find ways to cleanse themand make them work in the system and
 probably less time thinking about new algorithms that can overcome they there

Speaker 1 :are other issues so where's your
 intuition what do you think the biggest impact the next 10 years lies is it insome breakthrough algorithms or is it in
 just this at scale rigor a rigorous approach to data cleaning dataorganizing data onto the same algorithm
 packed in the applied world is well if

Speaker 0 :you're really in the company and you
 have to deliver results using known techniques and enhancing data seems likethe more expedient approach that's very
 low risk and likely to generate better and better results and that's why theChinese approach has done quite well now
 there are a lot of more challenging startups and problems such as autonomousvehicles medical diagnosis that existing
 algorithms may probably won't solve and that would put the Chinese approach morechallenged and give them more
 breakthrough innovation approach more more of an edge on those kinds of

Speaker 1 :problems so let me talk to that a little
 more so you know my intuition personally is that data can take us extremely farso you brought up autonomous vehicles
 and medical diagnosis so your intuition is that huge amounts of data might notbe able to completely help us solve that


Speaker 0 :problem right so breaking that down
 further in autonomous vehicle I think huge amounts of data probably will solvetrucks driving on highways which will
 deliver a significant value and China will probably lead in that and full l5autonomous is likely to require new
 technologies we don't yet know and that might require academia and greatindustrial research both innovating and
 working together and in that case us has an advantage so the interesting question

Speaker 1 :in there is I don't know if you're
 familiar on the autonomous vehicle space and the developments with Tesla and ElonMusk I am where they are in fact full
 steam ahead into this mysterious complex world of full autonomy l5 l4 l5 andthey're trying to solve that purely with
 data so the same kind of thing that you're saying is just for highway whichis what a lot of people share your
 intuition yeah they're trying to solve with data it's just a linger on thatmoment forever do you think possible for
 them to achieve success with simply just a huge amount of this training on edgecases on difficult cases in urban
 environments not just highway and so on

Speaker 0 :I think they'll be very hard one could
 characterize Tesla's approach as kind of a Chinese strength approach right gatherall the data you can and hope that will
 overcome the problems but in autonomous driving clearly a lot of the decisionsaren't nearly solved by aggregating data
 and having a feedback loop there are things that are more akin to humanthinking and how would those be
 integrated and built there has not yet been a lot of success integrating humanintelligence or you know call it expert
 systems to be well even though that's a taboo word with the machine learning andthe integration the two types of
 thinking hasn't yet been demonstrated and the question is how much can youpush a purely machine learning approach
 and of course Tesla also has an additional constraint that they don'thave all the sensors
 I know that they think is foolish to use lidar s but that's clearly a one lessvery valuable and reliable source of
 inputs that they're forgoing which may also have consequences I think theadvantage of course is capturing data no
 one has ever seen before and in some cases such as computer vision and speechrecognition I have seen Chinese
 companies accumulate data that's not seeing anywhere in the Western world andthey have delivered superior results but
 then speech recognition and object recognition are relatively suitableproblems for deep learning and don't
 have the potentially need for the human intelligence analytical planning

Speaker 1 :elements in the same on the speech
 recognition side your intuition that speech recognition and the machinelearning approaches to speech
 recognition won't take us to a conversational system that can pass theTuring test which is sort of maybe akin
 to what driving is so it needs to have something more than just simply simplelanguage understanding simple language


Speaker 0 :generation roughly right I would say
 that's based on purely machine learning approaches it's hard to imagine it couldlead to a full conversational experience
 across arbitrary domains which is akin to l5 I'm a little hesitant to use theword Turing tests because the original
 definition was probably too easy we

Speaker 1 :probably do that yeah the spirit of the
 Turing test that's what I was referring of course so you've had major leadershipresearch positions at Apple Microsoft
 Google so continuing on the discussion of America Russia Chinese soul andculture and so on
 what is the culture Silicon Valley in contrast to China and maybe us broadlyand what is the unique culture of each
 of these three major companies in your

Speaker 0 :view I think in aggregates Silicon
 Valley companies and we could probably include Microsoft in that even thoughthey're not in the valley is really
 dream big and have visionary goals and believethat technology will conquer all
 and also the self confidence and the self entitlement that whatever theyproduce the whole world should use and
 must use and those are historically important I think you know Steve Jobsfamous quote that he doesn't do focus
 groups he looks in the mirror and asks the first in the mirror what do you wantand that really is an inspirational
 comment that says the great company shouldn't just ask users what they wantbut develop something that users will
 know that they want when they see it but they could never come up with themselvesI think that is probably the most
 exhilarating description of what the essence of Silicon Valley is that thisbrilliant idea could cause you to build
 something that couldn't come out of focus groups or a be tests and iPhonewould be an example of that no one in
 the age of blackberry would write down they want an iPhone or multi-touch abrowser might be another example no one
 would say they want that in the days of FTP but once they see it they want it soI think that is was Silicon Valley's
 best at but it also comes with came with a lot of success these products becameglobal platforms and there were
 basically no competitors anywhere and that has also led to belief that theseare the only things that one should do
 that companies should not tread on other companies territory so that's a you knowGroupon and the Yelp and then open table
 and the GrubHub with each field ok I'm not gonna do the other company'sbusiness because that would not be the
 pride of innovating whatever each of these four companies have innovated butI think the Chinese approach is do
 whatever it takes to win and it's a winner take all marketand in fact in the internet space the
 market leader will get predominantly all the value extracted out of the system soand the and the and the system isn't
 just defined as one narrow category but gets broader and broader so it's amazingambition for success and domination of
 increasingly larger product categories leading to clear market winner statusand the opportunity to extract
 tremendous value and that develops a practical result oriented ultraambitious winner-take-all gladiatorial
 mentality and if what it takes is to build what the competitors builtessentially a copycat that can be done
 without infringing laws if what it takes is to satisfy a foreign country's needby forking the codebase and building
 something that looks really ugly and different they'll do it so it'scontrasted very sharply with the Silicon
 Valley approach and I think the flexibility and the speed and executionhas helped the Chinese approach and I
 think the Silicon Valley approach is potentially challenged if every Chineseentrepreneurs learning from the whole
 world US and China and the American entrepreneurs only look internally andright off China as copycat and the
 second part of your question about the three companies the unique elements of

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the three companies perhaps yeah I think
 Apple represents while the user please the user and the essence of design andbrand and it's the one company and
 perhaps the only tech company that draws people with a a strong serious desirefor the product and the knee and the
 willingness to pay a premium because of the halo effect of the brand which camefrom the
 attention to detail and great respect for user needs microsoft represents aplatform approach that builds giant
 products that become very strong modes that others can't do because it's wellarchitected at the bottom level and the
 work is efficiently delegated to individuals and then the the the wholeproduct is build by adding small parts
 that sum together so it's probably the most um effective high tech assemblyline that builds a very difficult
 product that and the whole process of doing that is kind of a differentiationand something competitors can't easily


Speaker 1 :repeat are there elements of the Chinese
 approach and the way Microsoft went about assembling those little pieces anddominating them was essentially
 dominating the market for a long time or do you see this is distinct I think

Speaker 0 :there are elements that are the same I
 think the three American companies that had or have Chinese characteristics andobviously as well as American
 characteristics are Microsoft Facebook and Amazon yes that's right Amazon

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :because these are companies that will
 tenaciously go after adjacent markets build up strong private offering and andfind ways to extract greater value from
 a sphere that's ever-increasing and they understand the value of the platforms sothat's the similarity and then with
 Google I think is a genuinely value oriented company that does have a heartand soul and that wants to do great
 things for the world by connecting information and that has also verystrong technology genes and
 wants to use technology and has found out-of-the-box ways to use technology todeliver incredible value to the end-user


Speaker 1 :we can look at Google for example you
 mentioned heart and soul there seems to be an element where Google is aftermaking the world better there's a more
 positive view I mean I used to have the slogan don't be evil yeah and andFacebook a little bit more as a negative
 tint to it at least in the perception of privacy and so on do you have a sense ofhow these different companies can
 achieve because you've talked about how much we can make the world better in allthese kinds of ways with AI what is it
 about a company that can make give it a heart and soul gain the trust of thepublic and just actually just not be
 evil and do good for the world it's

Speaker 0 :really hard and I think Google has
 struggled with that first that don't do evil mantra is very dangerous becauseevery employees definition of evil is
 different and that has led to some difficult employee situations for themso I don't necessarily think that's a
 good value statement but just watching the kinds of things Google or its parentcompany alphabet does in new areas like
 health care like you know eradicating mosquitoes things that are really not inthe business of a Internet tech company
 I think that shows that there is the heart and soul and desire to do good andwillingness to put in the resources to
 do something when they see it's good they will pursue it that doesn'tnecessarily mean it has all the trust of
 the users I realize while most people would view Facebook as the primarytarget of their recent and happiness
 about Silicon Valley companies many would put Google in that category andsome have named Google's business
 practices as predatory also so it's kind of difficult to have the twoparts of a body the brain wants to do
 what it's supposed to do for shareholder maximize profit and then the heart andsoul wants to do good things that may
 run against at what that brain wants to

Speaker 1 :do so in this complex balancing that
 these companies have to do you've mentioned that you're concerned about afuture were too few companies like
 Google Facebook Amazon are controlling our data are controlling too much of ourdigital lives can you elaborate on this
 concern and perhaps do you have a better way forward

Speaker 0 :I think I'm hardly the most vocal a
 complainer of this course there are a lot louder complaints out there I doobserve that's having a lot of data thus
 perpetuates their strengths and limit competition in many spaces but I alsobelieve a AI is much broader than the
 internet space so the entrepreneurial opportunity still exists in using AI toempower financial retail manufacturing
 education applications so I don't think it's quite a case of um fullmonopolistic dominance that makes that
 totally stifles innovation but I do believe in their areas of strength ishard to to dislodge them I don't know if
 I have a good solution probably the best solution is let the entrepreneurial VCecosystem work well and find all the
 places that can create the next Google the next Facebook so there will alwaysbe increasing number of challengers in
 some sense that has happened a little bit you see uber Airbnb having emergeddespite the strength of the that the big
 three and and I think China as an environment may be more interesting forthe emergence because if you look at
 companies between let's say 50 to 300 billion dollars China has emerged moreof such companies than the you
 in the in the last three to four years because of the larger marketplacebecause of the more fearless nature of
 the entrepreneurs that and and the Chinese Giants are just as powerful asAmerican ones Tenzin Alibaba very strong
 but by tense has emerged worth 75 billion and financial well it's Alibabaaffiliated it's nevertheless independent
 and worth 150 billion and so III do think if we start to extend totraditional businesses we will see value
 very valuable companies so it's probably not the case that in five or ten yearswe'll still see the whole world with
 these five companies having such dominance so you've mentioned a couple

Speaker 1 :times this fascinating world of
 entrepreneurship in China of the fearless nature of the entrepreneur socan you maybe talk a little bit about
 what it takes to be an entrepreneur in China what are the strategies that areundertaken what are the ways to achieve
 success what is the dynamic of vfc funding of the way the government helpscompanies isn't one what are the
 interesting aspects here that are distinct from they're different from theSilicon Valley world of entrepreneurship


Speaker 0 :home many of the listeners probably
 still would brand Chinese entrepreneur as copycats and no doubt ten years agothat would not be an inaccurate
 description back ten years ago an entrepreneur probably could not getfunding if he or she could not describe
 what product he or she is copying from the US the first question is who hasproven this business model which is a
 nice way of asking Corey copying and and that reason is understandable becauseChina had a much lower internet
 penetration and and didn't have enough indigenous experience to buildinnovative products and
 secondly the internet was emerging link startup was the way to do thingsbuilding a first minimally viable
 products and then expanding was the right way to go and the Americansuccesses have given the shortcuts that
 if you took your if you build your minimally Viable Product based on anAmerican product it's guaranteed to be a
 decent starting point then you tweak it afterwards so as long as there's no IPinfringement which as far as no there
 hasn't been in the mobile and AI spaces that's a much better shortcut and Ithink Silicon Valley would view that as
 still not very honorable because that's not your own idea to start with but youcan't really at the same time believe
 every idea must be your own and believe in the Lean Startup methodology becauseLean Startup is intended to try many
 many things and then converge one that works and it's meant to be iteratingchanged so finding a decent starting
 point without legal violations there should be nothing morally dishonorable

Speaker 1 :about that so just a quick pause on that
 it's fascinating that that's is why is that not honorable right he's exactly asyou formulated is it seems like a
 perfect start for business yeah is to to take you know look at Amazon and sayokay well we'll do exactly what Amazon
 is doing let's start there yeah in this particular market and then let's I'llinnovate them from that starting point
 yes I'm up with new ways I mean is it wrong to be accept the word copy catchysounds bad but is it wrong to be a
 copycat it just seems like a smart strategy but yes doesn't have a heroicnature to it yeah that like I said like
 a Steve Jobs Elon Musk sort of in something completely coming up with

Speaker 0 :something completely new yeah I like the
 way you describe it it's a non heroic acceptable way to start the company andmaybe more expedient so that's the
 that's I think a baggage for silicon vally that if it doesn't let go then itmade limits the ultimate ceiling of the
 company take snapchat as an example I think you know Evans brilliance he buildgreat products but he's very proud that
 he wants to build his own features not copy others while Facebook was morewilling to copy his features and you see
 what happens in the competition so I think putting that handcuff on a companywould limit its ability to reach the
 maximum potential so back to the Chinese environment copying was merely a way tolearn from the American masters just
 like we if you would we learned to play piano or painting you start by copyingyou don't start by innovating when you
 don't have the basic skill sets so very amazingly the Chinese entrepreneursabout six years ago started to branch
 off with these lean startups built on American ideas to build better productsthan American products but they did
 start from the American idea and today we we Chad is better than whatsapp Weibois better than Twitter and Yahoo is
 better than Korra and so on so that I think is some Chinese entrepreneursgoing to step two and in step three is
 once these entrepreneurs have done one or two of these companies they they nowlook at the Chinese market and the
 opportunities and come up with ideas that didn't exist elsewhere so productslike and financial under which includes
 Ali pay which is mobile payments and also the financial products for loansbuilt on that and also in education VIP
 kid and in social video social network tick-tock and in social ecommerce pindodo and then in ride-sharing mo bike
 these are all Chinese innovative products that now are being copiedelsewhere so and and the additional
 interesting herbs raishin is some of these products arebuilt on unique Chinese demographics
 which may not work in the US but may work very well in Southeast Asia Africaand other developing worlds that are a
 few years behind China and a few of these products may be armed Universaland are getting traction even in the
 United States such as tick tock so this whole ecosystem is supported by VCSas a virtuous cycle because a large
 market with with innovative entrepreneurs will draw a lot of moneyand then invest in these companies so as
 the market gets larger and larger u.s. mark china market is easily three fourtimes larger than the u.s. they will
 create greater value and greater returns for the VCS thereby raising even moremoney
 so at San ovations ventures our first fund was fifteen million our last fundwas five hundred million so it reflects
 the valuation of the companies and our us going multistage and things like thatit also has government support but not
 in the way most Americans would think of it the government actually leaves theentrepreneurial space as a private
 enterprise so they're self-regulating and the government would buildinfrastructures that would around it to
 make it work better for example the mass entrepreneur mass innovation plan buildseight thousand incubators so the
 pipeline is very strong to the VCS for autonomous vehicles the Chinesegovernment is building smart highways
 with sensors smart cities that separate pedestrians from cars that may allowinitially an inferior autonomous vehicle
 company to launch a car without increasing with lower casualty becausethe roads or the city is smart and the
 Chinese government at local levels would have these guiding funds acting as LPSpassive LPS to funds and when the fund
 makes money part of the money made is given back to the GPS and potentiallyother LPS to reach increase everybody's
 return at the expense of the government's return so that'sinteresting incentive that and trusts
 that task of choosing entrepreneurs to VCS who are better added in thegovernment by letting some of the
 profits I'll move that way so this is

Speaker 1 :really fascinating right so I look at
 the Russian government as a case study where let me put it this way there is nosuch government driven large-scale
 support of entrepreneurship and probably the same is true in the United Statesbut the entrepreneurs themselves kind of
 find a way yeah so maybe in a form of advice or explanation how did theChinese government arrive to be this way
 so supportive entrepreneurship to be in this particular way so forward-thinkingat such a large scale and also perhaps
 how can we copy it in other countries yeah that how can we encourage othergovernments given the United States
 government to support infrastructure for autonomous vehicles in that same kind of

Speaker 0 :way perhaps yes so these some techniques
 are the result of several key things some of which may be learn the both someof which may be very hard one is just
 trial and error and watching what everyone else is doing I think it'simportant to be humble and not feel like
 you know all the answers the guiding funds idea came from Singapore whichcame from Israel and China made a few
 tweaks and turned it into a because the Chinese cities and government officialskind of compete with each other because
 they all want to make their city more successful so they can get the nextlevel in their crew in their political
 career and it's somewhat competitive so the central government made it a bit ofa competition everybody has a budget
 they can put it on AI or they can put it on bio or they can put it on energy andthen whoever gets the results the city
 shines the people are better off the mayor gets a promotionso the tools
 kind of almost like an entrepreneurial environment for local governments to seewho can do a better job and also many of
 them try different experiments some have given award to very smartresearchers just give them money and
 hope they'll start the company some have given money to academic research labsmaybe government research labs to see if
 they can spin-off some companies from the science lab or something like thatsome have tried to recruit overseas
 Chinese to come back and start companies and they've had mixed results the onethat worked the best was the guiding
 funds so it's almost like a Lean Startup idea where people try different thingsand what works sticks and everybody
 copies so now every city has a guiding fund so that's how that came aboutthe autonomous vehicle and the massive
 spending in highways in smart cities that's a Chinese way it's about buildinginfrastructure to facilitate it's a
 clear division of the government's responsibility from the market themarkets should do everything in a
 private freeway but there are things the market can't afford to do likeinfrastructure so the government always
 appropriate large amounts of money for infrastructure building this happenedhappens with not only autonomous vehicle
 in the eye but happened with the 3G and 4G you'llfind that the Chinese a wireless
 reception is better than the u.s. because massive spending that tries tocover the whole country whereas in the
 US it may be a little spotty it's a government driven because I think theyview the coverage of of cell access and
 3G 4G access to be a governmental infrastructure spending as opposed to asopposed to capitalistic so that's of
 course the state-owned enterprises also publictraded but they also carry a government
 responsibility to deliver infrastructure to all so it's a different way ofthinking that may be very hard to inject
 into Western countries to say starting tomorrowbandwidth infrastructure and highways
 are going to be governmental spending with some characteristics what's your

Speaker 1 :sense and sorry to interrupt but because
 it's such a fascinating point do you think on the autonomous vehicle spaceit's possible to solve the problem of
 full autonomy without significant investment in infrastructure well that's

Speaker 0 :really hard to speculate I think it's
 not a yes/no question but how long does it take question you know 15 years 30years 45 years clearly with
 infrastructure augmentation where there's ro the city or whole cityplanning building a new city I'm sure
 that will accelerate the day of the l5 I I'm not knowledgeable enough and it'shard to predict even one we're
 knowledgeable because a lot of it is speculative but in the US I don't thinkpeople would consider building a new
 city the size of Chicago to make it a I slash autonomous city they're smallerones being built I'm aware of that
 but is infrastructure spent really impossible for us or Western countries Idon't think so the u.s. highway system
 was built was that during President Eisenhower or Kennedy as Eisenhower yeahso so so maybe historians can study how
 the President Eisenhower get the resources to build this massiveinfrastructure that surely gave us
 tremendous amount of prosperity over the next decade if not century if I may

Speaker 1 :comment on that then it takes us to
 artificial intelligence a little bit because in order to build infrastructureit it creates a lot of jobs so I'll be
 actually interested if you would say that you talk in your book about allkinds of jobs that could
 could not be automated I wonder if building infrastructures one of the jobsthat would not be easily automated
 something you could think about because they think you mentioned somewhere inthe talk or that there there might be as
 jobs are being automated a role for government to create jobs that can't be

Speaker 0 :automated yes I think that's a
 possibility back in the last financial crisis Chinaputs a lot of money to basically give
 this economy a boost and a lot of it a lot of the one into infrastructurebuilding and and I think that's a
 legitimate way and the government level to to deal with the employment issues aswell as build out the infrastructure as
 long as the infrastructures are truly needed and as long as there isn't anemployment problem which no we don't


Speaker 1 :know so maybe taking a little step back
 if you've been a leader and a researcher in AI for several decades at least 30years so how is AI changed in the west
 and the east as you've observed as you've been deep in it over the past 30years


Speaker 0 :well a I began as the pursuits of
 understanding human intelligence and the term itself represents that but it kindof drifted into the one sub area that
 worked extremely well which is machine intelligence and that's actually moreusing pattern recognition techniques to
 basically do incredibly well on the limited or domain large amount of databut relatively simple kinds of farm
 planning tasks and not very creative so so we didn't end up building humanintelligence
 we built a different machine that was a lot better than us some problems butnowhere close to us other problems so
 today I think a lot of people still misunderstand when we say artificialintelligence and what various products
 can do people still think it's aboutreplicating human intelligence but the
 products out there really are closer to having invented the internet or thespreadsheet or the database and getting
 broader adoption and peeking further to

Speaker 1 :the fears near-term fears that people
 have about AI so you're commenting on the sort of thegeneral intelligence that people in the
 popular culture from sci-fi movies have a sense about AI but there's practicalfears about AI the kind the narrow AI
 that you're talking about of automating particular kinds of jobs and you talkabout them in the book so what are the
 kinds of jobs in your view that you see in the next 5-10 years beginning to beautomated by AI systems algorithms yes


Speaker 0 :this is a also maybe a little bit
 counterintuitive because it's the routine jobs that will be displaced thesoonest and they may not be displaced
 entirely maybe 50% 80% of a job but when the workload drops by that muchemployment will come down and also
 another part of misunderstanding as most people think of AI replacing routinejobs then they think of the assembly
 line the workers well that will have some effect but it's actually theroutine white-collar workers that's
 easier to replace because to replace the white-collar worker you just needsoftware to replace a blue-collar worker
 you need robotics mechanical excellence and the ability to deal with dexterityand maybe even unknown environments very
 very difficult so if we were to categorize the most dangerouswhite-collar jobs there would be things
 like back-office people who copy and paste and deal withsimple computer programs and data and
 maybe paper and OCR and they don't make strategic decisions they basicallyfacilitate the process the software and
 papers don't work so you have people dealingwith new employee orientation searching
 for past lawsuits and financial documents and doing reference check for

Speaker 1 :basic searching and management of data
 data that's the most in danger of being

Speaker 0 :lost in addition to the white-collar
 repetitive work a lot of simple interaction work can also be taken careof such as telesales telemarketing
 customer service as well as many physical jobs that are in the samelocation and don't require a high degree
 of dexterity so fruit picking dishwashing assembly line inspection ourjobs in that category so all together
 back office is a big part and the other the the the blue-collar may be smallerinitially but over time they I will get
 better and when we start to get to over the next 15 20 years the ability toactually have the dexterity of doing
 assembly line that's a huge chunk of jobs and and when autonomous vehiclesstart to work initially starting with
 truck drivers but eventually to all drivers that's another huge group ofworkers so I see modest numbers in the
 next five years but increasing rapidly after that I'm worried of the jobs that

Speaker 1 :are in danger and the gradual loss of
 jobs I'm not sure if you're familiar with Andrew yang yes I am so there's acandidate for president of the United
 States whose platform Andrew yang is based around in part around job loss dueto automation and also in addition the
 need perhaps of universal basic income to support jobs that are folks who losetheir job due to automation and so on
 and in general support people under complex unstable job market so what areyour thoughts about his concerns him as
 a candidate his ideas in general I think

Speaker 0 :his thinking is generally in the right
 direction [Music]but his approach as a presidential
 candidate maybe a little bit head at a timeI think the displacements will happen
 but will they happen soon enough for people to agree to vote for himthe unemployment numbers are not very
 high yet and I think you know he and I have the same challenge if I want totheoretically convince people this is an
 issue and he wants to become the president people have to see how canthis be the case when an employment
 numbers are low so that is the challenge and I think I think we do I do agreewith him on the displacement issue on
 universal basic income at a very vanilla level I don't agree with it because Ithink the main issue is retraining so
 people need to be incented not by just giving a monthly $2,000 check or $1,000check and do whatever they want because
 they don't have to know how to know what to retrain to go into what type of a joband guidance is needed and Retraining is
 needed because historically when technology revolutions when routine jobswere displaced new routine jobs came up
 so they there was always room for that but with a eye on automationthe whole point is replacing all routine
 jobs eventually so there will be fewer and fewer routine jobs and an AI willcreate jobs but it won't create routine
 jobs because if it creates routine jobs why wouldn't a I just do it so thereforethe people who are losing the jobs
 aren't losing routine jobs the jobs that are becoming available are non routinejobs
 so the social stipend needs to be put in place is for the routine workers wholost their jobs to be retrained maybe in
 six months maybe in three years takes a while to retrain on a non routine joband then take out a job that will last
 for that person's lifetime now having said that if you look deeply intoAndrews document he does cater for that
 so I'm not disagreeing with what he's trying to do but for simplificationsometimes he just says ubi but simple
 ubi wouldn't work and I think you've

Speaker 1 :mentioned elsewhere that I mean the goal
 isn't necessarily to give people enough money to survive or live or even toprosper the point is to give them a job
 that gives a meaning that meaning is extremely important that our employmentat least in the United States and
 perhaps it cares across the world provides something that's forgive me forsaying greater than money it provides
 meaning so now what kind of jobs do you think can't be automated you talk alittle bit about creativity and
 compassion in your book what aspects do you think it's difficult to automate for

Speaker 0 :an AI system because an AI system is
 currently merely optimizing it's not able to reason plan or think creativelyor strategically it's not able to deal
 with complex problems it can't come up with a new problem and solve it a humanneeds to find the problem and pose it as
 an optimization problem then have the AI work habits so in AI would have a veryhard time discovering a new drug or
 discovering a new style of painting or dealing with complex tasks that such asmanaging a company that isn't just about
 optimizing the bottom line but also about employee satisfaction corporatebrand and many many other things so that
 is one category of things and because these things are challenging creativecomplex doing them creates a higher high
 degree of satisfaction and therefore appealing to our desire for workingwhich isn't just to make the money make
 the ends meet but also that we've accomplished something that others maybecan't do or can do as well
 another type of job that is much numerous would be compassionate jobsjobs that require calm
 empathy human touch human trusts hey I can't do that because AI is coldcalculating and even if it can fake that
 to some extent it will make errors and that will make it look very silly andalso I think even if they added okay
 people would want to interact with the people another person whether it's forsome kind of a service or a teacher or a
 doctor or concierge or a masseuse or a bartender there are so many jobs wherepeople just don't want to interact with
 a cold robot or software I've had an entrepreneur who built an elderly carerobot and they found that the elderly
 really only used it for customer service and huhbut not to service the product but they
 click on the customer service and the video of a person comes up and then theperson says how come my daughter didn't
 call me let me show you the grandkids so people learn for that people peopleinteraction so even the robots improved
 people just don't want it and those jobs are going to be increasing because AIwill create a lot of value 16 trillion
 dollars to the world in next 11 years according to PwC and that will givepeople money to enjoy services whether
 it's eating a gourmet meal or tourism and traveling or having conciergeservices the the service is revolving
 around you know every dollar of that 16 trillion dollars will be tremendous itwill create more opportunities that are
 to service the people who did well through AI with with with things buteven at the same time the entire society
 is very much short in need of many service oriented compassionate orientedjobs the best example is probably in
 healthcare services there's going to be 2 million new jobsnot coming replacement just in brand-new
 incremental jobs in the next six years in health care services that includesnurses orderly in the hospital
 elderly care and and also at home care it's particularly lacking and those jobsare not likely to be filled so there's
 likely to be a shortage and the reason they're not filled is simply becausethey don't pay very well and that the
 social status of these jobs are not very good so they pay about half as much as aheavy equipment operator which will be
 replaced a lot sooner and they pay probably comparably to someone on theassembly line and if so if we ignoring
 all the other issues and just think about satisfaction from one's jobsomeone repetitively doing the same
 manual action and assembly line that can't create a lot of job satisfactionbut someone taking care of a sick person
 and and getting a hug and thank you from that person in the and the family Ithink is is quite satisfying
 so if only we could fix the pay for service jobs there are plenty of jobsthat require some training or a lot of
 training for the people coming off the routine jobs to take we can easilyimagine someone who was maybe a cashier
 at the grocery store s stores become automated learned to become a nurse or aat home care also to one the point now
 the blue-collar jobs are going to stay around a bit longer some of them quite abit longer
 you know a I cannot be told go clean an arbitrary home that'sincredibly hard arguably is an l5 level
 of difficulty right and then AI cannot be a good plumberbecause plumber is almost like a mini
 detective that has to figure out where the leak came from so yet AI probablycan be an assembly line and auto
 mechanic and so on so one has to study which blue-collar jobs are going awayand facilitate retraining for the people
 to go into the ones that won't go away or maybe even will increase I mean it is

Speaker 1 :fascinating that it's easier to build
 a world champion chess player than it is to build a mediocre plumber yes right

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :very true iji and that goes
 counterintuitive to a lot of people's understanding of what artificialintelligence is so it sounds I mean
 you're painting a pretty optimistic picture about retraining about thenumber of jobs and actually the
 meaningful nature of those jobs once we automate repetitive tasks so overall areyou optimistic about the future where
 much of the repetitive tasks are automated that there is a lot of roomfor humans for the compassionate for the
 creative input that only humans can

Speaker 0 :provide I am optimistic if we start to
 take action if we have no action in the next five years I think it's going to behard to deal with the devastating losses
 that will emerge so if we start thinking about retraining maybe with thelow-hanging fruits explaining to
 vocational schools why they should train more plumbers that other mechanics maybe starting with some government subsidy
 for corporations to have more training positions we start to explain to peoplewhy retraining is important we start to
 think about what the future of education how that needs to be tweaked for the eraof AI if we start to make incremental
 progress and the greater number of people understand then there's no reasonto think we can't deal with this because
 this technological revolution is arguably similar to what electricityindustrial revolutions and internet
 brought about do you think there's a

Speaker 1 :role for policy for governments to step
 in to help with policy to create a

Speaker 0 :better world absolutely and I and the
 government's don't have to believe an employment will go up and they don'thave to believe automation will be this
 fast to do something revamping vocational school would be one exampleanother is if there is a big gap in
 health care service employment and we know that a country's population is isgrowing Oh
 more longevity living older because people over 80 require five times asmuch care as those under 80 then it is a
 good time to incent training programs for elderly care tofind ways to improve the pay maybe one
 way would be to offer as part of Medicare or the equivalent program forpeople over 80 to be entitled to a few
 hours of elderly here at home and then that might be reimbursable and that willstimulate the service industry around
 the policy do you have concerns about

Speaker 1 :large entities whether it's governments
 or companies controlling the future of AI development in general so we talkedabout companies do you have a better
 sense that governments can better represent the interest of the peoplethen companies or do you believe
 companies are better representing the interests of the people or is there noeasy answer I don't think there's an


Speaker 0 :easy answer because there's a
 double-edged sword the companies and governments canprovide better services with more access
 to data and more access to AI but that also leads to greater power which canlead to uncontrollable problems whether
 it's monopolies or corruption in the government so I think one has to becareful to look at how much data that
 companies and governments have and and some kind of checks and balances wouldbe helpful so again I come from Russia


Speaker 1 :there's something called the Cold War so
 let me ask a difficult question here looking at conflict the Steven Pinkerwritten a great book that conflict all
 over the world is decreasing in general but do you have a sense that havingwritten the book AI superpowers do you
 see a major international conflict potentially arising between majornations whatever they are with its
 roster China European nations United States or othersin the next 10 20 50 years around AI
 around the digital space cyberspace do you worry about that that is theresomething is that something we need to
 think about and try to alleviate or

Speaker 0 :prevent I believe in greater engagement
 a lot of the worries about more powerful AI are based on a arms race metaphor andthe when you extrapolate into military
 kinds of scenarios AI can automate and and and you know animus weapons thatneeds to be controlled somehow and
 autonomous decision-making can lead to not enough time to fix internationalcrises so I actually believe a Cold War
 mentality would be very dangerous because should two countries rely on AIto make certain decisions and they don't
 in talk to each other they do their own scenario planning then something couldeasily go wrong
 I think engagement interaction some protocols to avoid inadvertent disastersis actually needed so it's natural for
 each country to want to be the best whether it's in nuclear technologies orAI or bio but I think is important to
 realize if each country has a black box AI and that don't talk to each otherthat probably presents greater
 challenges to humanity then if they interacted I think there can still becompetition but with some degree of
 protocol for interaction just like when there was a nuclear competition therewere some protocol for deterrence among
 US Russia and China and I think that engagement is needed so of course we'restill far from AI presenting that kind
 of danger but what I worry the most aboutis the level of engagement seems to be
 coming down the level of distrust seems to be going up especially from the UStowards other large countries such as
 China and of course Russia and Russia yes is there a way to make that better

Speaker 1 :so that's beautifully put level
 engagement and even just basic trust and communication as opposed to sort of youknow making artificial enemies out of
 particular particular countries did you ever you have a sense how we can make itbetter
 mentionable items that as a society we

Speaker 0 :can take on I'm not an expert at
 geopolitics but I would say that we look pretty foolish as humankind when we arefaced with the opportunity to create
 sixteen trillion dollars for for Humanity and we we're in yet we're notsolving fundamental problems with parts
 of the world still in poverty and for the first time we have the resources toovercome poverty and hunger we're not
 using it on that but we're fueling competition among superpowers and that'sa very unfortunate thing if we become
 utopian for a moment imagine a a benevolent world government that hasthis 16 trillion dollars and maybe some
 AI to figure out how to use it to deal with diseases and problems and hate andthings like that world would be a lot
 better off so what is wrong with the current world I think the people withmore skill than then I should just think
 about this and then at your politics issue with superpower competition is oneside of the issue there's another side
 which I worry maybe even even even more which is as the 16 trillion dollars allgets made by US and China and a few of
 the developed other developed countries the poorer country will get nothingbecause they don't have technology and
 the the wealth disparity and the end of inequality will increase so a poor acountry with a large population will not
 only benefit from the AI pool or other technology booms but they will havetheir workers who previously had hoped
 they could do the china model and do outsourced manufacturing or the indiamodel so they could do the house or some
 process or call center all those jobs are going to be gone in 10 or 15 yearsso the the individual citizen may be a
 net liability I mean financially speaking to a poorer country and not anasset to claw itself out of poverty so
 in that kind of situation these large countries with was not much tech aregoing to be facing a downward spiral and
 it's unclear what could be done and and then when we look back and say there's16 trillion dollars being created and
 it's all being kept by us China and other developed countries it justdoesn't feel right so I hope people who
 know about geopolitics can find solutions that's beyond my expertise so

Speaker 1 :different countries that we've talked
 about have different value systems if you look at the United States to analmost extreme degree there is a an
 absolute desire for freedom of speech if you look at a country where I was raisedthat desire just amongst the people is
 not that not as elevated as it is basically fundamental level to theessence of what it means to be America
 right and the same is true with China there's different value systems andthere is some censorship of Internet
 content that China and Russia and many other countries undertake do you seethat having effects on innovation other
 aspects of some of the text of AI development we talked about and maybefrom another angle do you see that
 changing different ways over the next 10 years 20years 50 years as China continues to
 grow as it does now in its tech

Speaker 0 :innovation there's a common belief that
 full freedom of speech and expression is correlated with creativity which iscorrelated with entrepreneurial success
 I think empirically we have seen that is not true and China has been successfulthat's not to say the fundamental values
 are not right or not the best but it's just that that that perfect correlationisn't isn't there it's hard to read the
 tea leaves on an opening up or not in any country and I've not been very goodat that in my past predictions but I do
 believe every country shares some fundamental value a lot of fundamentalvalues for the long-term so you know
 China is drafting its privacy policy for individual citizens and theydon't look that different from the
 American or European ones so people do want to protect their privacy and havethe opportunity to express and I think
 the fundamental values are there the question is in the execution and timinghow soon or when will that start to open
 up so so as long as each government knows ultimately people want that kindof protection there should be a plan to
 move towards that as to when or how and I'm not an expert on the point of

Speaker 1 :privacy to me it's really interesting so
 AI needs data to create a personalized awesome experience yeah all right I'm

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :just speaking general in terms of
 products and then we have currently depending on the age and depending onthe demographics of who we were talking
 about some people are more or less concerned about the amount of data theyhandover so in your view how do we get
 this balance right that we provide an amazing experience to people that useproducts you look at Facebook you know
 the more Facebook knows about you yes it's scary to say the better you canprobably yeah but experience it could
 probably create so any of you how do we get that balance right yes I think a lot

Speaker 0 :of people have a misunderstanding that
 it's okay and possible to just rip all the data out from a provider and give itback to you so you can deny them access
 to further data and still enjoy the services we have if we take back all thedata all the services will give us
 nonsense will no longer be able to use products that function well in terms ofyou know right ranking right products
 right user experience so so yet I do understand we don't want to permitmisuse of the data from legal policy
 and point I think there can be severe punishment for those who have egregiousmisuse of the data that's I think a good
 first step actually China in this side on thisaspect has very strong laws about people
 who sell or give data to other companies and and that over the past few yearssince the that loud locking came into
 effect pretty much eradicated the illegaldistribution sharing of data
 additionally I think giving I think in technology is often a very good way tosolve technology misuse so can we come
 up with new technologies that will let us have our cake and eat it toopeople are looking into homomorphic
 encryption which is letting you keep the data have it encrypted and train onencrypted data of course we haven't
 solved that one yet but that kind of direction may be worth pursuingalso federated learning which would
 allow one hospital to train on its hospital's patient data fully becausethey have a license for that and then
 hospitals would then share their models not data with models to create a superAI and that also maybe has some promise
 so I would want to encourage us to be open-minded and think this think of thisas not just the policy binary yes/no but
 letting the technologists try to find solutions to let us have our cake ineither two or have most of our cake and
 eat most of it too finally I think giving each end user achoice is important and having
 transparency is important also I think that's universal but the choice you giveto the user should not be at a granular
 level that the user cannot understand gdpr today causes all these pop ups ofyes/no will you give this site this
 right to use this part of your data I don't think any user understands whatthey're saying yes or no to and I
 suspect most are just saying yes because they don't understandso while GDP are in its current
 implementation has lived up to its promise of transparency and user choiceit implemented it in such a way that
 really didn't deliver the the spirit of GDP our it fit the letter but not thespirit so again I think we need to think
 about is there a way to fit the spirit of GDP our by using some kind oftechnology can we have a slider that's
 an AI trying to figure out how much you want to slide between perfect protectionsecure security of your personal data
 versus high degree of convenience with some risks of not having full privacyeach user's should have some preference
 and that gives you the user choice but maybe we should turn the problem on itshead and ask can there be an AI
 algorithm that can customize this because we can understand the slider butwe sure cannot understand every pop up
 question and I think getting that right

Speaker 1 :requires getting the balance between
 what we talked about earlier which is heart and soul versus profit drivendecisions and strategy I think from my
 perspective the best way to make a lot of money in the long term is to keepyour heart and soul intact
 I think getting that slider right in the short term may feel like you'll besacrificing profit but in the long term
 you were beginning user trusts and providing a great experience do youshare that kind of view in general yes


Speaker 0 :absolutely I would I sure would hope
 there is a way we can do long term projects that's really do the rightthing I think a lot of people who
 embrace GDP are their hearts in the right place I think they just need tofigure out how to build a solution I've
 heard utopians talk about solutions that get me excited but not sure how in thecurrent funding environment they can get
 started right people talk about imagine thiscrowd-sourced data collection that we
 all trust and then we have these agents that we ask them to ask the trustedagent to we that agent only that
 platform said trusted joined platform that that we all believe is trustworthythat can give us all the closed-loop
 personal suggestions by the new social network new search engine new e-commerceengine that has access to even more of
 our data but not directly but indirectly so I think that general concepts oflicenses into some trusted engine and
 finding a way to trust that engine seems like a great idea but if you think howlong it's gonna take to implement and
 tweak and develop it right as well as to collect all the Trust's and the datafrom the people it's beyond the current
 cycle of venture capital right so how do you do that it's a big question you've

Speaker 1 :recently had a fight with cancer
 Stage four lymphoma and a in a sort of deep personal level what did it feellike in the darker moments to face your
 own mortality well I've been the

Speaker 0 :workaholic my whole life and I've
 basically worked nine ninety six 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. six days a weekroughly and I didn't really pay a lot of
 attention to my family friends and people who loved me and my life revolvedaround optimizing for work while my work
 was not routine my optimization really what made my life basically a verymechanical process but I got a lot of
 highs out of it because of accomplishments that I thought werereally important and dear and the
 highest priority to me but when I faced mortality and thepossible death in a matter of months
 I suddenly realized that this really meant nothing to me that I didn't feellike
 working for another minute that if I had six months left in my life I would spendit all with my loved ones and you know
 thanking them giving them love back and apologizing to them that I lived my lifethe wrong way so so that moment of
 reckoning caused me to really rethink that's why we exist in this world is issomething that we might be too much
 shaped by the society to think that success and accomplishments is why welive but while that can get you periodic
 successes and satisfaction it's really in the facing death you see what's trulyimportant to you so as a result of going
 through them the challenges with cancer I've resolved to live a more balancedlifestyle I'm now in remission knock on
 wood and I'm spending more time with my family my wife travels with me when mykids need me I spend more time with them
 and before I used to prioritize everything around work when I had alittle bit of time I would dole it out
 to my family now when my family needs something really need something I dropeverything at work and go to them and
 then in the time remaining I allocate to work but once family is veryunderstanding it's not like they will
 take me 50 weeks so 50 hours a week from me so I'm actually able to still workpretty hard maybe ten hours less per
 week so I realized the most important thing in my life is really love and thepeople I love and that give that the
 highest priority it isn't the only thing I do but when that is needed I put thatat the top priority and I feel much
 better and I feel much more balanced and I think this also gives a hint as to alife of routine work a life of pursuit
 of numbers while my job was not routine it wasn't pursuit of numbers pursuit ofcan I make more money can i fund more
 great companies can I raise more money can I make sure our VC is ranked higherand higher every year this competitive
 nature of driving for bigger numbers and better numbers became a endless pursuitof that's mechanical and bigger numbers
 doesn't really didn't make me happier and faced with death I realized thebigger numbers really meant nothing and
 what was important is that people who have given their heart and their love tome deserve for me to do the same there's


Speaker 1 :deep profound truth in that that
 everyone should hear and internalize and that's really powerful for you to saythat I have to ask sort of a difficult
 question here so I've competed and sports my wholelife looking historically I'd like to
 challenge some aspect of that a little bit on the point of hard work that itfeels that there are certain aspects
 that is the greatest the most beautiful aspects of human nature is the abilityto become obsessed of becoming extremely
 passionate to the point where yes flaws are revealed and just giving yourselffully to a task that is in another sense
 you mentioned love being important but in another sense this kind of obsessionthis pure exhibition of passion and hard
 work is truly what it means to be human what lessons should we take this deeperbecause Eve accomplished incredible
 things you say it chasing numbers but really there's some incredible workthere so how do you think about that
 when you look back in your 20s 30s what was what would you do differently would

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you really take back some of the
 incredible hard work

Speaker 0 :I would but it's it's in percentages
 right we're both computer scientists so Ithink when one balances one's life when
 when one is younger you you might give a smaller percentage to family but youwill still give him high priority and
 when you get older you would give a larger percentage to them and still thehigh priority and and when you're near
 retirement you give most of it to them and the highest priority so I think thekey point is not that we would work 20
 hours less for the whole life and just spend it aimlessly with the family butthat when the family has a need when
 your wife is having a baby when your daughter has a birthday or when they'redepressed or when they're celebrating
 something or when they have a get-together or we have family time thatit's important for us to put down our
 phone and PC and be a hundred percent with them and that priority on thethings that really matter isn't going to
 be so taxing that it would eliminate or even dramatically reduce ouraccomplishments it might have some
 impact but it might also have other impact because if you have a happierfamily maybe you fight less you fight
 less you don't spend time taking care of all the aftermath of a fight so it'sunclear that it would take more time and
 if it did I'd be willing to to take that reduction and it's not a dramatic numberbut it's a number that I think would
 give me a greater degree of happiness and knowing that I've done the rightthing and still have plenty of hours to
 it to get the success that I want to get

Speaker 1 :so given the many successful companies
 that you've launched and much success throughout your career what advice would

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you give to young people today
 King or doesn't have to be young but people today looking to launch and tocreate the next one billion-dollar tech
 startup or even AI base startup I would

Speaker 0 :suggest that people understand
 technology waves move quickly what worked two years ago may not work todayand that is very much case in point for
 AI I think two years ago or maybe three years ago you certainly could say I havea couple of super-smart PhDs and we're
 not sure what we're gonna do but here's what how we're gonna start and getfunding for a very high valuation those
 days are over because AI is going from rocket sciencetowards mainstream not yet commodity but
 more mainstream so first the creation of any company toeventual capitalists has to be creation
 of business value and monetary value and when you have a very scarce commodityVCS may be willing to accept greater
 uncertainty but now the number of people who have the equivalent of PhD threeyears ago because that can be learned
 more quickly platforms are emerging the costs to become a AI engineer is muchlower and there are many more AI
 engineers so the market is different so I would suggest someone who wants tobuild an AI company be thinking about
 the normal business questions what customer cases are you trying to addresswhat kind of pain are you trying to
 address how does that translate to value how will you extract value and get paidthrough what channel and how much
 business value will get created that's today needs to be thought about muchearlier upfront then it did three years
 ago the scarcity question of AI talent haschanged the number of AI talent has
 changed so now you need not just AI but also understanding of businesscustomer and and the marketplace so I
 also think you should have a more reasonable valuation expectation andgrowth expectation there's going to be
 more competition but the good news though is that AI technologies are nowmore available in open source tensorflow
 pi torch and such tools are much easier to use so you should be able toexperiment and get results iteratively
 faster than before so take more of a business mindset to this think less ofthis as a laboratory taken into a
 company because we've gone beyond that stage the only exception is if you trulyhave a breakthrough in some technology
 that really no one has then then the old way still works but I think that'sharder and harder now so I know you


Speaker 1 :believe as many do that we're far from
 creating an artificial general intelligence system but say once we doand you get to ask her one question what


Speaker 0 :would that question be what is it that
 differentiates you and me beautifully

Speaker 1 :put careful thank you so much for your
