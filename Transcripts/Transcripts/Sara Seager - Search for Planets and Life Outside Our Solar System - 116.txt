Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with
 sarah seeger a planetary scientist at mit knownfor her work on the search for
 exoplanets which are planets outside of her solar systemshe's an author of two books on this
 fascinating topic plus in a couple days august 18th hernew book
 a memoir called the smallest lights in the universeis coming out i read it and i can
 recommend it highly especially if you love space and are abit of a romantic like
 me it's beautifully written she weaves the stories of the tragedies and thetriumphs of her life
 with the stories of her love for and research onexoplanets which represent our hope to

 here's my conversation with sarah seeger when did you first fall in love with the

Speaker 1 :stars i think i've always loved the
 stars one of my first memory is of the moon iremember watching the moon
 and i was in the car with my dad who my parents were divorced and he was drivingme and my siblings to his house for the
 weekend and the moon was just following me justhad no idea why that was


Speaker 0 :yeah so like looking up at the sky and
 there's this glowing thing how do you make sense of the moon thatat that age at age at like age five


Speaker 1 :there's just no way you can
 i think it's one of the great things about being a kid it's just thatcuriosity that that all kids have


Speaker 0 :you know i was thinking because there's
 these uh uh almost uh out there ideas of of thatour earth is flat
 uh floating about on the internet and it made me think you know when did i firstrealize that
 the earth is um like this ball that's uh flying through empty spacei mean it's terrifying it's uh
 awe-inspiring i don't know how to make sense of it

Speaker 1 :it's uh it's hard because we live in our
 frame of reference here on this planet yeah it's nearly impossible none of usare lucky to go to see the curvature of
 earth

Speaker 0 :i mean do you remember when you realized
 understood like the physics like the layout of the solar system thisis it was it like
 did you first have to take physics to really uhlike high school physics to really take


Speaker 1 :that in i think it's hard to say
 i had this book when i was a child it was in french i grew up in canada wherefrench is
 supposedly taught to all of us english-speaking canadiansand it was this friend book in french
 was about the solar system and i just love flipping through itit's hard to say how much you know you
 or i understand when we're kids but it

Speaker 0 :was really a great book
 what about the stars when did you first

Speaker 1 :learn about the stars
 like i do have this very incredible distinctive memory and again it had todo with my dad he took us camping now my
 dad was from the uk and he was the type who you'dfind wearing a tie on weekends
 so camping was not in his sphere his comfort zonewe had a babysitter every summer we got
 a baby we every summer we had a babysitterand one summer we had tom he was barely
 older than we were he was 14 my brother was 12. i would have been 11or 10 maybe and we went camping because
 tom said camping's the thing we should we should try it and i just rememberi didn't aim to see the stars but i
 walked out of my tent in the middle of the nightand i looked up and wow
 so many stars the dark night sky and all those stars just like screaming at mei just couldn't believe that honestly
 like my first thought was this is so incredible mind-blowinglike why wouldn't anyone have told me


Speaker 0 :this existed can anyone else see this


Speaker 1 :have you have you had an ex have you
 experienced like that with anything

Speaker 0 :like yeah i've had that i mean i don't
 know if maybe you can tell me if it's the sameuh i've had that with robots
 uh there's a few robots i've met where i just fell in love with this likeis anyone else seeing this is anyone
 else seeing that here in a robot is our ability toengineer some intelligent beings
 intelligent beings that we could love that could love us that we can interactwith
 in some rich ways that we haven't yet discoveredlike uh almost like when you get a puppy
 it needs to have a dog and there's this uh immediate bond andlove
 and on top of that ability to engineer itit was you know i had to just pause and
 and hold myself i imagine i don't have kids i imagine there's a magic to thatas well
 or it's a totally new experience it's

Speaker 1 :like what
 well yeah the stars though unlike kids or the puppy it's only a good thing

Speaker 0 :so you felt you weren't terrified like
 it's to me when i look at the stars it'salmost paralyzingly scary
 how little we know about the universe how alone we are i mean somehow it feelsalone
 i'm not sure if it's a it's just a matter of perspective but it feels likewow there's billions of them out there
 and we know nothing about them and then also immediately to me somehow mortalitycomes into it
 i mean how did that make you feel at

Speaker 1 :that time i think as a child without
 articulating it i felt that same way just like wow this is terrifying what'sout there like what is this
 what does it mean about us here uh you

Speaker 0 :you're a scientist an exo world class
 scientist planetary scientist astronomer uh now i'm a bit of an idiotwho likes to ask silly questions so some
 questions are a little bit in the realm of speculationalmost philosophical because we know so
 little and one of the awesome things about yourwork is you've actually put data and
 real science behind some of the biggest questions that we're all curious aboutbut nevertheless many of the questions
 might be a little bit speculative so on that topic uh just in your sensedo you think
 we're alone in the universe human beings do you think there's life out there well

Speaker 1 :lex the funny thing is is that as a
 scientist i so don't even want to answer thatyou do you really don't i will answer
 them yeah but i just loved you resisted naturally yeah we naturally resist thatbecause we want numbers and hard facts
 and not speculation but i do love that question it's a great question and it'sone we all wonder about
 but i have to give you the scientist answer first yeah sure which iswe'll have the capability to answer that
 question soon even starting soon

Speaker 0 :how do you define soon how do i define
 science what do you so much happen in the last 100 years

Speaker 1 :right right and there's a difference
 right if it's 10 years or 20 years or 100 years yeahthere's a difference in that well soon
 could be a decade or two decades and then by the wayjournalists usually don't like that or
 the people want like tomorrow they want the news but what it's going to take istelescopes space telescopes or very
 sophisticated ground or space telespace telescopes tolet us study the atmospheres of other
 planets far away and to look what's in the atmospheres and to look for waterwhich is needed for life as we know it
 to look for gases that don't belong that we might attribute to life so we have todo some really nitty-gritty


Speaker 0 :astronomy so the the promising way to
 answer this question scientifically is to look for hints oflife that's where like many of your
 ideas come in of what kind of hints why might weactually see about this


Speaker 1 :right right that's exactly what we need
 to do and i like the word you chose hint because it's going to be a hint it's notgoing to be a 100 percent yay we found
 it and then it will take future generationsto do more careful work to hopefully
 even find a way to send a probe to these distant exoplanetsand to really figure this out for us i


Speaker 0 :mean we'll talk about the details
 those are fun but like uh back to the

Speaker 1 :speculation
 zoomed out big pictures yes i believe absolutely there is life outthere somewhere
 because there the vastness of the universeis incredible it's so breathtaking when
 we look at the night sky if you can go to that dark skyyou can see you know many many hundred
 or even if you have good eyesight and you'resomewhere very dark you could see
 thousands of stars but in our galaxy we have hundreds ofbillions of stars
 and our universe has hundreds of billions of galaxiesso think about all those stars out there
 and even if planets are rare even if life is rarejust because the number of stars is so
 huge things have to come together somewheresomeplace in our universe yeah it's so


Speaker 0 :amazing to think that somebody might be
 looking up on another planet in a distant galaxy

Speaker 1 :and get back to in our lifetime at least
 the short term we have to we only have the neareststars
 to look at it's true that there are so many starsso many hosts for planets that might
 have life but in the practical question of will we find it it has to bea star
 quite close to earth like a few light years tens of light years maybe hundredsof light years


Speaker 0 :and by the way you've introduced me to a
 tool of eyes on exoplanets i thinkthat nasa has put together isolated


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :clinics that's it
 software you guys that's so cool uh but anyway uhcan you give a sense of like who our
 neighbors are like you said uh hundreds of light yearslike how many stars are close by
 at like what what's our neighborhood like we're talking aboutfive ten stars that we might actually
 have a chance

Speaker 1 :to zoom in on i'm talking about maybe a
 dozen or two dozen

Speaker 0 :stars and those are that's with planets


Speaker 1 :that look
 suitable for us to follow up in detail

Speaker 0 :for life


Speaker 1 :right one thing that's really exciting
 in this field is that the very nearest star to earth calledproxima centauri
 it's part of the alpha centauri star

Speaker 0 :system cool name by the way yeah
 approximately whoever names them nearby okay but it sounds cool proxima

Speaker 1 :proxima centauri appears to have a
 planet around it that's an earth map about an earth mass planetin the so-called habitable zone or the
 goldilocks zone of the host star so think about how incredible that islike out of all the stars out there even
 the very nearest star has planets and has a planet of hugeinterest to us


Speaker 0 :yeah okay so can we talk about that
 planet what uh uh what what does it mean to be maybepossibly habitable habitable uh
 you know what uh what is how does size come into playhow does um you know what we know about
 gases and what kind of things are necessary for lifeyou know what are the factors that you
 make you think that it's habitable and by the way i mean maybe one way totalk about that is
 people know about the drake equation which isa very high level almost framework to
 think about what is the probability that correct me if i'm wrong that there'slife out there uh
 and intelligent life i think i don't knowbut then the equation named after you
 now which i think nicely focuses in on themore
 achievable and interesting uh part of thatquestion which is on whether there is
 habitable planets out there or how many i guess

Speaker 1 :right
 so the funny thing is was one time i met frank drakeand i asked if he minded if i took his
 equation and kind of revamped it for this new field ofexoplanet astronomy
 he was totally cool with it he's he got

Speaker 0 :total approval well maybe uh


Speaker 1 :okay so i'm not sure if he'd actually
 read the stuff about my equation but he was cool with it he was

Speaker 0 :cool with it uh okay so i just said like
 15 different things but maybe can you tell from your perspectivewhat is the drake equation
 and what is sorry the seeger equation

Speaker 1 :sure well the drake equation as you said
 it's a framework it's a description of the number ofcivilizations out there
 of intelligent beings that are able to communicate with us by radio wavesso if you think of like if you think of
 the movie contact you've seen contact rightwe're hoping to get we're listening in
 actually it's an active field of researchlistening to other stars at radio
 wavelengths hoping that some intelligent civilizations are sending usa message and the drake equation
 came like at the start of that whole field to put the factors down on paperto sort of illustrate what is involved
 to kind of estimating and there's no real estimate or a prediction of howmany civilizations are out there
 but it's a way to frame the question and show you each term that's involvedso i took the drake equation and i
 called it a revised drake equation and i recast it for the search forplanets by more traditional astronomy
 means we're looking at stars looking forplanets looking for rocky planets
 looking for planets that are the right temperature for lifelooking for planets that might have life
 that outputs gases that we might detect in the futureit's the same spirit of the drake
 equation it's not going to give us any magic numbersso i'm going to say hey here's exactly
 what's out there it's meant to kind of guide guide

Speaker 0 :of where we're going although the jerk
 equation did i mean the initial equation proposed actual numbers forthose variables


Speaker 1 :oh yes the equation proposed numbers and
 you can still plug your own numbers in and there'sthis really cute website that lets you
 for both the drake and my revised equation plug in some numbers and seewhat you get


Speaker 0 :so yeah so okay so what are what are
 i mean what are the variables but maybe also what are like the critical

Speaker 1 :variables so in my equation i set out to
 what are the numbers of inhabited planets that show signs oflife by way of gases in the atmosphere
 that can be attributed to life i could just walk through the termsthat's super simple the first thing i
 say is what are the number of stars available and it's not thatthose trillions and trillions of stars
 everywhere it's what are available to like a specific searchand so for example the mit led nasa
 mission tess is surveying the sky looking for allkinds of planets but it can also
 it also has stars it has about 30 000 red dwarf starsso we just take a number of stars that a
 given survey can access so that's what the number of stars isthen i wanted to know what kind of stars
 are uh quiet a quiet i called ita fraction of those stars that is quiet
 in the case of tess the way it's looking for planetsis planets that transit the star they go
 in front of the star as seen from the telescopebut it turns out that some stars are
 very active they're variable and they brighten and dim with time andthat interferes with our observation


Speaker 0 :i apologize to interrupt so it's a
 transiting planet so you're really looking for a black blobessentially that blocks the light


Speaker 1 :we're looking for a black blob that
 blocks light and then trying to say

Speaker 0 :something about the size of the planet
 uh from the frequency of that black blobs appearance and the size of that

Speaker 1 :black blob that kind of thing yeah but
 let's just say that out of all the stars there areaccessible to whatever telescope some of
 them are just bad for whatever reason you're not gonna beable to find planets around them so i
 need to know the fraction of those that are that are good so againwe have the number of stars the fraction
 of them that we can actually find planets around

Speaker 0 :um and by the way is our sun set one
 such is is our sun quiet our sun is quiet

Speaker 1 :okay
 so i have actually two terms one describes how quiet they are and one isif we can find a planet around that star
 these transiting planets for example not all planets transit because theplanet would have to be orbiting that
 star in this kind of plane as viewed from youbut if a star is for example orbiting in
 the plane of the sky it will never transitit will never go in front of the star so
 in that case we have to have a fraction thattakes into account that kind of
 geometric

Speaker 0 :factor and hopefully it's right i mean
 you can assume that it's uniformly

Speaker 1 :distributed hopefully yes we can assume
 and there's evidence that it's uniformly distributed yesso then the next so all of these factors
 so far number of stars accessible to whatevertelescope you're thinking about
 how many stars are quiet fractional stars that are quiet fractionthat are observable in this case for the
 geometric factor those are all things we can measure andthere's one more term in the seeger
 equation we can measure i call it fraction of planets in thehabitable zone
 because believe it or not we have a handle on that for acertain set of stars we know from our
 the kepler space telescope that operated for a number of yearswe have estimates for how many planets
 are in the so-called habitable zone of the host star for a certain type of starso all those we have measurable and then
 like the drake equation itself there are some terms we cannot measure and those ones i call them
 fl fraction of all those planets that havelife on them
 because we don't know what that is and fs i called for spectroscopythe fraction that have we can use our
 telescope and instrument tools to look for light actually fs was the onesthat the planets that
 that have life that actually gives off a gas a useful gas that might accumulatein the atmosphere
 so we could eventually observe it uh

Speaker 0 :how do the fl and fs interplay so these
 are separate terms

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :separate terms and so so for example
 you could imagine so for example you could imagine lifelike us humans we breathe out carbon
 dioxide but our planet earth we already have alot of carbon dioxide on it
 well we have hundreds of parts per million but it has a really strongsignal
 so us humans breathing out carbon dioxide it's not helpful for anyintelligent beings that are looking back
 at earth because there's already a lot of there'salready enough carbon dioxide we're not
 adding to it so if there is life on a planet and it'soutputting a boring gas that's not
 helpful for us to uniquely identify as being made by life versusjust being there anyway
 then it's not helpful so i separated those two terms outsoon i think we'll have evidence that
 planets that can support life

Speaker 0 :at least are common so
 okay this is such an awesome topic i have a million questions uhwhat okay i know it's a little bit of
 speculation but what's your sense about thatuh i think fs which is like
 that uh life would produce interesting gases that would be able todetect like is there
 one is there scientific evidence and and second is there some intuition aroundlife producing gases detectable hints in
 terms of

Speaker 1 :chemistry so interestingly enough that
 entire question relates to i'm gonna say almost mylife's work yeah the work i'm doing now
 and the work i'm doing for the next 20 yearsand i wish i could give you a concrete
 number like one percent like on the worst days it's one percent let'ssay in my mind
 you know in the best days it's like 80 and i could actually go intoa lot of detail here but i'll just give
 you the simplest things so first of all we make an assumptionthat like us
 and our life here on earth life uses chemistryso we use chemistry because we eat food
 we breathe air and we have metabolism thatto break down food to get energy to
 store energy and then ultimately to use it and alllife here has some kind of byproduct in
 doing all that some kind of waste product that goes into the atmosphereso i like to think that life everywhere
 uses chemistry some people have imagined like uh let'simagine like a windmill
 like mechanical energy just getting energy and using it without storing itand if there was life like that it might
 not need to output a gas so we make this basic assumption ofchemistry that's the first thing
 the second more complicated thing that i and my team work on is what happens tothe gas once it is
 produced by life it goes into the atmosphere and a lot of gasis just destroyed immediately actually
 by ultraviolet radiation or by oxygenoxygen's incredibly
 um destructive to a lot of gases so the gas canbe produced by life but it could be just
 completely destroyed by its environment

Speaker 0 :i guess we should pause on that that
 you mentioned your life's work i mean this is just a beautiful ideathat uh it's kind of paralyzing when you
 look out there and you wonder is there a life out therea b is it's the first paralyzing
 actually before i encountered your work i feel like an idiotbut you know uh it feels like there's no
 tool to answer that question and then what you kind of providedis this cool idea that it might be
 possible to answer that by looking at the gases i mean that's a reallyinteresting that's a beautiful idea and
 uh yeah so we could just pause on like that's as a powerful tool i thinkthat uh to build the intuition wrong
 because i was totally clueless about it and that was kind it's kind of excitingi mean i'm sure there's a
 folks probably early on in your life uh who were very skeptical about thisnotion well
 maybe i'm not sure but it's generally you would want to be skeptical it's likewell
 all these kinds of other things could generate gases you know all those

Speaker 1 :oh that's so true and that's a big part
 of this growing field is how to make sure that this gas isn't producedby another effect
 but i do want to you know again pausing on that and going back a bitit's incredible to think but like at
 least almost 100 years ago there's a record of someone talkingabout the idea of a gas being an
 indicator of life elsewhere oh

Speaker 0 :that idea was floating about it was


Speaker 1 :totally floating about
 and it comes down to oxygen which on our planet fills our atmosphereto 20 by volume and you know we rely on
 oxygen to breathe you know when they you hear about thepeople on mount everest running out of
 air they're really running out of oxygenwell they're running out of oxygen
 because the air is getting thinner as you they climb up the mountain butwithout plants and bacteria there's
 plants that bacteria that also photosynthesizes and produces oxygen asa waste product without those we would
 have virtually no oxygen our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen

Speaker 0 :so yeah what uh if you were to analyze
 uh earth is oxygen the strong indicator

Speaker 1 :here
 oxygen is a huge indicator and that's what we're hoping that there is anintelligent civilization
 not too far from here around a planet orbiting a nearby starwith the kind of telescopes we're trying
 to build and they're looking back at our sun and they've seen our earth and theysee oxygen and they
 they probably won't be like 100.00 sure that there's life making itbut if they go through all the possible
 scenarios they'll be left with a pretty strong hintthat there's life here yeah okay but how


Speaker 0 :do you detect
 that type of gases that are on the planet

Speaker 1 :from a distance and that's going back to
 that that's what people were skeptical aboutwhen i first started working on
 exoplanets long time ago people didn't believe we would ever everever study an exoplanet atmosphere of
 any kind and now dozens of them are studiedthere's a whole field of people
 hundreds of people working on exoplanet atmospheres actually wow

Speaker 0 :but first there was a point where people
 didn't even know there was exoplanets right when was the first exoplanet

Speaker 1 :detected the first exoplanet around a
 sun-like star anyway was detected in the mid-1990s

Speaker 0 :that was a big deal i kind of vaguely


Speaker 1 :remember that well at the time it was a
 big deal but it was also incredibly controversialbecause in exo you know planets
 we only had one example of a planetary system our own solar systemand in our solar system jupiter our big
 massive planet is really far from our star and thisfirst exoplanet around a sun-like star
 was incredibly close to its star it's star so close that people just couldn'tbelieve it was a planet actually


Speaker 0 :so maybe zoom out what the heck is an
 exoplanet

Speaker 1 :an exoplanet is our name like is the
 name that we call a planet orbiting a star other than oursun


Speaker 0 :right extra solar i guess is the number


Speaker 1 :you can call it extrasolar
 exoplanet is simpler but i think it's worth pausing to rememberthat each one of those stars out there
 in our night sky is the sun right and you know our sun has planetsmercury venus earth mars etc
 and so for a long time people have wondered do those other stars or othersuns have planets
 and they do and it appears that nearly every star has a planet has a planet wecall exoplanet
 and there are thousands of known exoplanets already so there's already

Speaker 0 :yeah like there's so many things about
 space that it's hard to put in into one'sbrain
 because it starts filling it with awe so yeah if you visualizethe fact that the stars that we see in
 the sky aren't just stars they're like they'resons
 and they very likely as you're saying will have planets around them there'sall these planets
 roaming about in this like dimly lit darkness with potentially uhlife i mean it's just mind-blowing but
 um maybe can you give a brief like history ofand like of discovering all the
 exoplanets so there's no exoplanets in the 90sand then there's a lot of exoplanets now
 so how did that come about so many

Speaker 1 :planets
 how did it come about well maybe another

Speaker 0 :way to ask is what is the methodology
 that was used to discover them i can say

Speaker 1 :that
 but i'd like to just say something else first where so in exoplanetsyou know the line between what is
 considered completely crazy and what is considered mainstreamresearch legit is constantly shifting


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :this is awesome yeah so before when i
 started on exoplanets it was still sketchy like it wasn'tconsidered a career or a thing
 a place where you should be investing and right nownow today it's so many people are
 working in this field a good i don't know at least a thousandprobably more i don't know if that
 sounds like a lot to you but it's a lot

Speaker 0 :no it's a legitimate field of inquiry


Speaker 1 :yeah legitimate field of increase and
 what's helped us is everything that's helpedeveryone else it's software it's
 computers it's hardware it's like our phones you have afantastic detector in there like they
 didn't always have that i don't know if you rememberthe so-called olden days we didn't have
 digital cameras we had film you take a film camera you send the filmaway and eventually it comes back and
 then you see your pictures and they could all be horrible yeah so

Speaker 0 :yeah it sent me digital
 it just changed everything data changed

Speaker 1 :everything yeah and so one thing that
 really helped exoplanets were detectors that were very sensitive because whenwe're looking for
 this the transiting planets what we're doing is we're monitoring a star'sbrightness as a function of time
 it's like click taking a picture of the stars every few secondsor minutes and we're measuring the
 brightness of a star like every frame and we're looking for adrop in brightness that's characteristic
 of a planet going in front of the star and then finishing its so-called transitand to make that measurement we have to
 have precise detectors

Speaker 0 :and uh the the detectors that are making
 the measurement can you do it from earth is it uh arethey floating about in space
 like what kind of telescope both so on

Speaker 1 :the ground people are using telescopes
 small telescopes that are almost just like a glorified telephoto lensand they're looking at big swaths of the
 sky and from the ground people can find giant planets like thesize of jupiter so it's about 10 to 12
 times the size of earth we can find big planets because we canreach about
 one percent precision so i'm not sure how much technical you want to get but

Speaker 0 :well yeah well how many pixels are we
 talking about like what uh you mentioned phones there's a bunch ofuh megapixels


Speaker 1 :i think so for exoplanets you want to
 think about it as like a pixel or less than a pixel we're not getting anyinformation
 but to be more technical our telescope you know spreads the light out over manypixels
 but we're not getting information we're not tiling the planet with pixelsit's just like a point of light or in
 most cases we don't even see the planet itself just the planet's effect on thestar
 but another thing that really helped was computers becausetransiting planets are actually quite
 rare i mean they don't all go in front of their star rightand so to find transiting planets we
 look at a big part of the sky at once or we look attens of thousands or hundreds of
 thousands or even in some cases millions of stars at one timeand so you know you're not going to do
 this by hand going through a million starscounting up the brightness we so we have
 computer software and computer code that does the job for usand looks for
 a you know counts the brightness and looks for a signalthat could be due to a transiting planet
 and you know i just finished a job called uh deputy science director forthe mit led nasa mission test
 and it was my purview to make sure that we got theplanet candidates the transiting light
 curves out to the community so people could follow them upand figure out if they're actual planets
 or false positives

Speaker 0 :so publish the data so that people could
 just uh yeah publish data all the all the data scientists out there couldcrunch and see if they can exactly


Speaker 1 :they can discover something and in fact
 the nasa policy for this mission is that all the data becomes public assoon as possible
 so anyone could act it's not as easy as it sounds though to download the dataand look for planets
 but there is a group called planethunters.org and they take the dataand they actually crowdsource it out to
 people to look for planets yeah and they often findfine signals that our computers and our
 team missed so

Speaker 0 :we mentioned exoplanets what about earth
 like or i don't know what the rightdistinction is if is it habitable or is
 it earth-like planets but what are those different categoriesand how can we tell the difference and
 detect each

Speaker 1 :right right so we're not at earth-like
 planets yet all the planets we're finding are sodifferent from
 what we have in our solar system they're just easier planets to find but likein which way for example there could be
 a jupiter-sized planet where an earth should bewe find planets that are the same size
 as earth but are orbiting way closer to theirstar than mercury is to our sun
 and they're so close that because close to a star means they also orbit fasterand some of these hot super earths we
 call them their year their time to go around theirstar is less than a day
 and they're heated so much by their star they're heated so much by the starwe think the surface is hot enough to
 melt rock so instead of running out by the bay or the riveryou'll have like liquid lava
 there'll be liquid lava lakes on these planets we think

Speaker 0 :and life can't survive way too hot


Speaker 1 :the molecules for life would just be
 molecules needed for life just wouldn't wouldn't be able to survive thosetemperatures
 we have some other planets one of the most mysterious things out therefactoid if you will is that the most
 common type of planet we know about so faris a planet that's in between earth and
 neptune size it's two to three times the size ofearth and we have no solar system
 counterpart of that planet that is like going outside to the forestand finding some kind of
 creature or animal that just no one has ever seen before and then discoveringthat is the most common thing out there
 and so we're not even sure what they are we have a lot of thoughts as to thedifferent types of planet it could be
 that people don't really know i mean

Speaker 0 :what are your thoughts about what it


Speaker 1 :could be
 well one thought and this is more when we want to be rather than might beis that these so-called mini neptunes we
 call them that they are water worlds that theycould be scaled up versions of jupiter's
 icy moons such that they are planets that are madeof more than half of water


Speaker 0 :by mass so yeah and what's the
 connection between water and life and the possibility of seeing that froma gas perspective


Speaker 1 :okay so all life on earth needs liquid
 water and so there's been this idea inastronomy or astrobiology for a long
 time called follow the water find water that will give you a chanceof finding life
 but we could still zoom out and the kind of the communityconsensus is that we need some kind of
 liquid for life to originate and to survivebecause molecules have to react
 if you don't have a way that molecules can interact with each otheryou can't really make anything and so
 when we think of all the liquids out there water is the most abundantliquid in terms of planetary materials
 there really aren't that many liquids like i mentioned liquid rock way too hotfor life
 we have some really cold liquids like almost gasoline like ethane and methanelakes that have been found on
 one of saturn's moons titan that's so cold thoughand for exoplanets we can't study really
 cold planets because they're just simply toodark and too cold so we usually so we're
 usually just left with looking for planets with liquid waterand
 to your point it's remember as we talked about how planets are lessthan a pixel
 in in that way to say so we can't see oceans on planet we're not going to seecontinents and oceans not yet anyway
 but we can see gases in the atmosphere and if it's a small rocky planetand this is going into some more detail
 it's a small if we see a small rocky planet with water vapor in theatmosphere
 we're pretty sure that means there has to be a liquid water reservoirbecause it's not intuitive in any way
 but water is broken up by ultraviolet radiationfrom the star
 or from the sun and on most planets when water is broken up into and o the hthe hydrogen will escape to space
 because just like when you think of a child letting go of a helium-filledballoon it
 floats upwards and hydrogen's a light gas and will leave from earthleave from the planet so ultimately if
 you have water unless there's an ocean like a way tokeep replenishing water vapor in the
 atmosphere that water vapor should be destroyedby ultraviolet radiation got it so


Speaker 0 :there's a
 okay so there's a need for liquid i mean i guess what is water well iswater essential is
 other liquids i mean the chemistry here is probably super complicated there's

Speaker 1 :not it does but you know there's not an
 infinite number of liquids right there's maybe like five liquidsthat can exist inside or on the surface
 of a planet and water is the one that exists for thelargest range of temperatures and
 pressures and it's also the easiest type of planetfor us to find and study as one with
 water vapor rather than a cold planet that hasethane and methane lakes


Speaker 0 :what's your personal in terms of solar
 systems and planets that you're most hopefulabout uh in terms of our closest
 neighbors that you kind of have a sense thatthere might be uh somebody living
 over there whether it's bacteria or somebody that looks like us

Speaker 1 :i'm hopeful that every star nearby has
 has a planet has some life because it almost has to for us to make progresswe have to have that dream condition so


Speaker 0 :the dream condition is like
 life is just super abundant out there

Speaker 1 :yeah the dream
 yes the dream condition is that life is super abundant and it's based onthe thought that if there is a planet
 with water and continents that it also has theingredients for life and that
 the kind of base does the base the base kernel thought is that if theingredients for life is there life will
 form

Speaker 0 :that's what we're holding on with the
 relatively high probability

Speaker 1 :yes that's that's it okay let's go into


Speaker 0 :land of speculation
 uh what about intelligent life uh us humans consider ourselvesintelligent surprisingly
 or unsurprisingly do you think about from your perspective of looking atplanets from a
 gas composition perspective and in general of how we might seeintelligent life
 and uh your intuition about whether that life is even out there

Speaker 1 :i think the life is out there somewhere
 the huge numbers of stars and planets i like to think that life had a chanceto evolve to be intelligent
 i'm not convinced the life is anywhere near here only becauseif it's hard for intelligent life to
 evolve then it will be far away by definition

Speaker 0 :well the sad thing is uh maybe from the
 artificial intelligence perspective is it makes me sad there might beintelligent life out there that we're
 just not like the pathways of evolutioncan go in all these different directions
 where we might not be able to communicate with itor even know that or even detect its
 intelligence or even comprehend its intelligence yeah convince cats aremore intelligent than humans
 that that we're just not able to comprehendthe the measures the the proper measures
 of their intelligence

Speaker 1 :my dog is so funny he's the golden
 doodle his name's leo we joke that he's either a really dumbdog and so he's not here to defend
 himself but he's either really dumb or he's a super genius just pretendingto be dumb yeah


Speaker 0 :i mean it's possible he's he's a
 multi-dimensional projection of alien life uh here monitoringuh one of the you know one of the top
 scientists in the world trying to find aliens just to make surejust just to make sure that humans don't
 get out of hand that's funny oh

Speaker 1 :i'm definitely going to go in and ask
 him ask him about that ask him about that he's on to something

Speaker 0 :yeah what might we
 look for in terms of signs of intelligent lifefrom your toolkit do you think there are
 things that we should we might be able to useor maybe in the next couple of decades
 discover that would be different than life that'slike bacteria


Speaker 1 :that's primitive life i still love seti
 search for extraterrestrial intelligence i like to hope that if there is acivilization out there they're trying to
 send us a message i think like think about it i don't knowwhat are your thoughts like if you think
 about our earth there's no structure we've built thatintelligent civilizations could see from
 far away there's literally nothing not even thegreat wall of china and so to think like
 why would this other civilization build a giant structure that we couldsee


Speaker 0 :yeah so with seti the idea is that we're
 both trying to hear signals and send signals right

Speaker 1 :we haven't sent one they call that medi
 messaging and there's a big kind of fear over medi because do you want totell them you're here
 it's kind of this like let's wait till they call us yeah

Speaker 0 :so uh we should have a dating game we
 have to like how how many days do i wait beforei call kind of thing


Speaker 1 :yes it and so but the funny thing is if
 no one's sending us a message if everybody's only listeninghow do you make progress that's right


Speaker 0 :and so i mean but there's also
 there's the voyager spacecraft so we we have these little pixels ofuh robots flying out all over the place
 some of them like the voyager reach out really farand they have some stuff stuff on them
 okay i just

Speaker 1 :we do we have the voyager but they're
 not really going anywhere in particular and they're movingvery very slowly on a cosmic scale yeah


Speaker 0 :and let me say
 they're far is kind of silly because

Speaker 1 :yeah it's all relative in astronomy it's
 all relative yeah

Speaker 0 :yeah i just i so from uh if you look at
 earth from an alien perspective from visually and from gas compositioni wonder if it's possible to determine
 the degree of maybe um productiveenergy use i wonder if it's possible to
 tell like how busy these earthlings are well

Speaker 1 :let's zoom out again and think about
 oxygen so when cyanobacteria arose likebillions of years ago and figured out
 how to harness the energy of the sun for photosynthesisthey re-engineered the entire atmosphere
 20 of the atmosphere has oxygen now likethat is a huge scale you know they
 almost poisoned everything else by making this what was apparently verypoisonous to everything that was alive
 but imagine so are we doing anything at that scale like are we changing anythingin like 20
 of the earth with a giant structure or 20 of this or 20of that like we aren't actually yeah


Speaker 0 :yeah that's
 that's uh that's humbling to think that we're not actually having that much ofan impact i know


Speaker 1 :but we are because in a way we're
 destroying our entire planet but it's humbling to think that from far awaypeople probably can't even tell but from


Speaker 0 :the perspective of the planet
 when we say we're destroying you know global warming all that kind of stuffum what we really mean is we're
 destroying it for a bunch of different speciesincluding humans
 but like i think the earth will be okay

Speaker 1 :oh the earth will be the earth will
 remain whatever whatever happened to us theearth will still be here and it'll still


Speaker 0 :be difficult to detect any difference
 like it's sad to think that if humans destroy ourselves exceptpotentially when you clear war
 it'd be hard to tell that anything even

Speaker 1 :happened yeah it will be hard to tell
 from far away that anything happened what about what

Speaker 0 :are your thoughts now this is really
 getting into speculation land there you've you've mentioned exoplanets werein the realm of you know there's this
 beautiful edge between science and science fictionthat uh some of us a rare few are brave
 enough to walk i think in academia you were braveenough to do that
 i think in some sense artificial intelligence sometimes walks that linea little bit um there is so much
 excitement about extraterrestrial life and aliens in thisworld
 i mean i don't know what how to comprehendthat excitement but to me it's great to
 see people curious because to me extraterrestriallife and aliens
 is at the core a scientific question and it's almost looks like people areexcited about science they're
 excited by discovery discovery right

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :and then the possibility that there's
 alien life that visited earth or is here on earth now isis uh excitement about discovery
 in your lifetime essentially i mean what do you make what do you make ofthat there's recent events where darpa
 um or dod released footage of uh these um unmannedaerial phenomena they're calling them
 now uap they got everybody like super excitedlike maybe there is like what
 what what's what's here on earth uh do you followthe this world of people who are
 thinking about aliens that are already here or have

Speaker 1 :visited i don't really follow it they
 follow me i'd say because in this field if you're ascientist of any kind you get
 the people contact us me there's a lot of them about hey i havestuff you should see
 hey the aliens are already here i need to tell you about itand i know there are people out there
 who really believe

Speaker 0 :there's a psychology to it there's a


Speaker 1 :psychology to it and


Speaker 0 :it's fascinating but okay so it's
 similar to artificial intelligence but i

Speaker 1 :still but like you i'm still enamored
 with the point that it is out there and that people believe so strongly andthat so many people out there


Speaker 0 :believe i believe and uh
 i don't know i i i'm not as allergic to it assome scientists are because ultimately
 if aliens showed up or do show up or have showedup
 you know these are going to be very difficult to study scientific phenomenalike in fact like going back to cats and
 dogs like i just i think we should be moreopen-minded about
 uh developing new tools and looking for intelligent life on earth that wehaven't yet found
 or even understanding the nature of our own intelligencebecause it kind of is an alien life form
 the thing that's living you know in our skull it's so true when

Speaker 1 :we don't understand consciousness
 yeah it's true we don't understand how biology is hardyou know unpacking it and working it all
 out it's a stretch and they say too that our thinking mind is like the tip of thepyramid
 that everything else is happening under the hood and but what is happeningbut the thing with so the typical
 scientists response to you know are there aliens hereis that we need to see major evidence
 not like a sketchy picture of something we need some cold hard evidence and wejust don't have that


Speaker 0 :that's exactly right but from my
 perspective i admire people that dream and i thinkthat's beautiful
 the thing i don't like there's two sides of the of the folksuh that probably listen to this this
 podcast is oh those that dream i think is beautifulthat uh
 that wonder what's out there what's here on earth and then the other oneswho are very conspiratorial in thinking
 that stuff is being hidden right becomes about institutions okay

Speaker 1 :i have a funny thing to tell you about
 that so one of my colleagues had a really good answer to thatand it's not me saying this so i can say
 this but he said look he works with nasa not at nasa he works with government notin the government
 it's kind of me but he'd say trust me they couldn't hide it if they trieddo you know what i'm saying like
 everybody we're not we're not smart enough or good enoughnot we or not me or not you but whoever
 to cover it up it just

Speaker 0 :it's sort of a myth yeah
 it makes it sad because um the people at nasa the people at mitthe people in academia the people in
 these institutions and yes even in government are oftentrying they're like just curious
 descendants of apes they're just they they want to do goodthey want to discover stuff they're not
 trying to hide stuff in fact most of them would in terms ofleaks
 would uh love to discover this and release this kind of stuff

Speaker 1 :and there's a did you ever watch this
 show called the x-files yeah scully and mulder yeah and what ilove actually i used to put it up during
 my talks my public talks there's a picture of aufo or what looks like ufo and it says
 i want to believe so that's that's where i think a lot of us arecoming from i want to believe
 and it's so great and one time i put that upand this very very nice couple
 approached me really nervous afterwards and they said hey can we take you outfor lunch sometime
 and i said sure and they were like the nicest peopleand just one of many who has an alien
 alien abduction story and the woman um could never have kidsthey were older but they didn't have
 kids which for them was a real source of regret but it was because the aliens whohad abducted her had made it so that she
 couldn't have kids and she had apparently somethingimplanted behind her ear which was
 somehow unimplanted later and they were just so sincere andthey're such a lovely couple
 they just wanted to share their story

Speaker 0 :that's that's a real
 whatever that is that's the real thing the mystery of the human mindright is more powerful than any alien
 or i mean it's uh as interesting i think as the universe andi think they're somehow intricately
 linked maybe getting a sense of numbershow many stars are there in
 maybe i don't know what the radius that'sreasonable to think about i don't know
 if the observable universe is like way too big to think about butin terms of when we think about how many
 habitable planets there are what are the numbers we're working within your sense
 what are the scales honestly the numbers

Speaker 1 :are probably like billions of trillions
 of stars yeah you know in the uk i think i don't know if we do that here but theywill call a billion trillion
 where you put like 1 billion followed by a trillionyeah it's kind of weird but here i don't
 even know how to say the number 10 to the 20. like if you know what that isthat's 1 followed by 20 zeros that's a
 big number and we don't have a name for that numberthere's so many


Speaker 0 :per star i think we kind of mentioned
 this is there a good sense there's probably argument about this butper star how many planets are there


Speaker 1 :is there we don't have that number yet
 per se you know we're not really there butsome people think that there's many
 planets per star there's this analogy of filling the coffee cup like you know youdon't usually just pour one drop you
 fill it and that planetary systems we see starsbeing born
 that have a disk of gas and dust and that ultimately forms planetsso the idea this kind of concept is that
 planets so many planets form too many andeventually some get kicked out
 and you're left with like a full planetary system a dynamically fullsystem and so there have to be a lot
 because so many form and a bunch survive that i mean that

Speaker 0 :that makes perfect intuitive sense right
 like why wouldn't that happen

Speaker 1 :right well there's other thoughts too
 though these big planets that are really close to the starwe think they formed far away from the
 star where there's enough material to formand they migrated inwards and some of
 these planets migrating inwards due to interaction with other planets or withthe disk itself they may have cleared it
 out like kicked other planets out of thesystem so there's a lot of ideas
 floating around we're not entirely sure and what about

Speaker 0 :earth-like planets is that that's
 another level of uncertainty that it's a

Speaker 1 :level of uncertainty if we think of an
 earth-like planet being an earth around a sun in the sameorbit
 an earth-like planet being an earth-sized planet in an earth-likeorbit about a sun-like star
 we're not there yet you know we're not able to detect enough of those toto give you a hard number some people
 have extrapolated and they will say as many as one in fivestars like our sun
 could be hosting a true earth-like

Speaker 0 :planet wow on the topic of space
 exploration there's been a lot of excitingdevelopments with nasa with spacex
 with other companies successfully uh getting rockets intospace
 with humans and getting them to land backuh especially with spacex what are your
 thoughts about elon musk and spacex crew dragonwell working with nasa to launch
 astronauts what's your sense about uh theseexciting new developments


Speaker 1 :well spacex and other so-called
 commercial companies are only good news formy field because they're lowering the
 cost of getting to space by having reusable rockets it's justbeen it's incredible and we need cheaper
 access to space so from a very practical viewpoint it's all goodabout getting people there's this dream
 that we have to go to mars

Speaker 0 :boots on boots on mars
 what do you think about that you mentioned probes what's the value ofhumans
 uh is that interesting to you from both scientific and a humanperspective human mostly i think it's


Speaker 1 :such in our desire to explore
 because part of what it means to be human so wanting to go to another planetand and
 be able to live there for some time it's just justwhat it means to be human you know
 oftentimes in science and engineering big huge discoveries are made when wedidn't intend to
 so often this kind of pure exploratory type of research or this pureexploration research it can lead to
 something really important like the laser we couldn't really livewithout that now
 at the grocery you scan your foods there's surgery that involves involvedlasers gps
 we all use our gps we don't have gps because someone thought heyit'd be great to have a navigation
 system and so i do support i do i just but i reallythink it comes primarily just from the
 desire to explore

Speaker 0 :do you think something there's a lot of
 criticism and a lot of excitement about mars do you think there'svalue in trying to go to put humans on
 mars first of all and second of all colonize marsdo you think there's something
 interesting that might come from there i

Speaker 1 :i'm convinced there will be something
 interesting i just don't know what it is yetbut i don't think i don't think having
 some commercial value or value in the metric of something useful is reallywhat's motivating us


Speaker 0 :so really uh you see exploration is a
 long term investment into something awesome that eventually be commercialvalue


Speaker 1 :yeah i do actually yeah i do so what


Speaker 0 :about
 visiting okay i apologize but i mean there's an exciting longingto um
 visit earth-like planets elsewhere so what's the closestuh earth-like planet you think is worth
 visiting and how how hard is it wow it is

Speaker 1 :very hard i mean our nearest call it
 earth mass planet it's orbiting a star very different from our own sun an mdwarf star
 a small red star proxima centauri it's over four light years away and wecan't travel at the speed of light
 we can't even try i mean it would take tens of thousands of years to get therewith conventional methods so you know
 the movies like multi-dimensional yeah this moviepassenger have you seen that movie
 passenger it's about a big spaceship thatis traveling to another planet and
 everyone's hibernating i won't give you the spoiler alert because one personwakes up and then it's kind of a problem
 okay got it but yeah the multi-generational ships i meanwhen you think about where we're headed
 as a species maybe we don't send people maybe we endup sending
 raw biological materials and instructions to print outhumans it sounds kind of far-fetched but
 already we're printing like liver cells in the lab andbeating heart cells
 we're starting to reconstruct body parts i mean the thing is it is so hard to getto another planet that this thought of
 printing humans or printing life forms actually could be easier

Speaker 0 :yeah that's somehow so sad
 to think to think of the idea that we would launch a successfulspaceship that has multi-generational
 like non-human life and it's going to reachother intelligent life and by the time
 they figure out where it came from human civilization will be extinct wow

Speaker 1 :yeah that is really


Speaker 0 :exciting that's so that's one you
 there's a there's a tempting thing to think about what are the possibletrajectories so
 uh you know elon keeps talking about multi-uh planetaryus becoming multi-planetary species i
 mean sure mars is a part of that but likethe dream is to really expand outside
 the solar system and it's it's not clear just like as yousaid
 like what the actual scientific engineering steps that are requiredto to take it seems like so daunting
 so daunting so like this the smart thing seems to beto do the most achievable near
 daunting task even if there doesn't seem to be a commercial applicationwhich i think is colonizing mars but
 like from your perspective is there some manhattan project stylehuge project in space that
 we might want to take on and you've had rolesyou had scientist hat roles and then you
 also have roles in terms of being on like committees and stuffdetermining where funding goes
 and so on so like is there a huge like multi-trillion we've been throwing the tword around
 recently a lot but these huge projects that we might want to take on

Speaker 1 :well first of all we want to find the
 planets like earth first like just even finding those earth-likeplanets is a billion dollar endeavor
 billions of dollars endeavor and that's so hard becausean earth is so small so less massive and
 so faint compared to our sun it's the proverbial needle in a haystackbut worse and
 we need very sophisticated space-based telescopes to be able to find theseplanets and to look
 look at them and see which ones have water and which ones have signs of lifeon them


Speaker 0 :yeah the the star shade project that
 your shade starship yeah this is probably themost badass thing i've ever seen right


Speaker 1 :you know what's interesting so what's
 amazing about starshade is it was first conceived of in the 1960simagine that and revisited every decade
 until now when we think we can actually build it and starshadeis a giant specially shaped screen it is
 about there's different versions of it butthink about 30 meters in diameter


Speaker 0 :so you're blocking out the sun you're


Speaker 1 :effectively blocking out the star
 yeah so that you can see the planet directly and starshadewould have a spacecraft attached to it
 and it would fly in space far away from earth's gravity and itwould have to formation fly with a space
 telescope so the idea is that starshade blocks outthe starlight in a very careful way
 and it has to block that starlight out so that the planetthat is 10 billion times fainter than
 the star that only the planet light goes to the telescope yeah so

Speaker 0 :in formation meaning the telescope flies
 and um as you're giving a presentation on this but like it it would flylike and um this is extremely
 high precision endeavor yeah we had this

Speaker 1 :analogy like
 asking a friend to hold up a dime five miles away yeahperfectly like at the perfect line of
 sight with you yeah

Speaker 0 :and the shape of it is pretty cool i
 mean uh i don't know exactly what the physics of that like what the optics arethat require that shape i can tell you


Speaker 1 :it turns out that if you block out a
 star imagine blocking out a star with acircle circularly or a square shaped
 screen you wouldn't actually be blocking itbecause the star
 acts like a wave the starlight can act like a wave and it would actuallybend around the edges of the screen and
 so instead of blocking out the light you're expecting to see nothing youwould see ripples
 and the analogy that i love to give it's like throwing a pebble in a pondyou get those ripples you get these
 concentric ripples and they go out and light woulddo something quite similar
 you'd actually see ripples of light and those ripples of lightthey're actually way brighter than the
 planet we'd be looking for

Speaker 0 :so yeah so they would introduce this
 noise that's yeah noise and so this star

Speaker 1 :shade
 it's like a mathematical solution to the problem of diffraction it's calledand this is what the first person who
 thought about star shade in the 1960s worked out the mathematical shape or onesolute one family of solutions and the
 idea is that when the star shade this very special shape like a giantflower with petals
 when it blocks out the light the light bends around the edges but interactswith itself in a way to give you a very
 very dark image it would be like throwing a pebble in apond and instead of getting ripples
 the pond would be perfectly smooth like incredibly smooth to one part in 10billion
 and all the waves would be on the outer edges far away from where you droppedthat petal


Speaker 0 :pebble and so what this camera would be
 able to uh this camera this telescope would beable to
 get uh get some signal from the planet then yes and it would be hard because

Speaker 1 :the planet is so faint but with the star
 out of the way the glare of that bright bright bright starwith that out of the way then it becomes
 a much more manageable task

Speaker 0 :so how do we get that thing out there
 we're working with unlimited money okay

Speaker 1 :working with unlimited money um
 we have some more engineering problems to solve but not too many morewe've been burning down our so-called
 tall pool list and then we just what kind of list wecall it tall techno
 uh technology tall pole it's the phrase whereyou have to figure out what are your
 hardest problems and then break those down to solveso the starshade one of the really hard
 problems was how did formation fly at tens of thousands of kilometers it'slike wow
 that is insane and the team broke that down actually into a sensing problembecause of the star shade how do you see
 the star shade precisely enough to to control it because if you're shininga flashlight you know the beam spreads
 out so the star shade has a beacon an led ora laser it's going to spread out so much
 by the time it gets to the telescope the problem wasn't how do you tell the starshade how to move around fast enough to
 stay in a straight line the problem was how do you how are youable to sense it well enough so
 problems like that were broken down and money that came from nasa to solveproblems is
 put towards solving it so we're we've got through most of the hard problemsright now another one
 was that star shade even though it's looking at a starlight from our own sun could hit the
 edges of the star shade and bounce off into the telescopebelieve it or not
 and that would actually ruin it because we're trying to see this tiny tinysignal so then the question is how do
 you make a razor thin edge like those petal edges would be likehave to be like a razor
 what materials can you so there's a series of problems like that so wow so

Speaker 0 :there's a materials problem in there


Speaker 1 :some of them
 and there's one so we almost finished solving all those problems and then it'sjust a matter of
 building one and testing it in a full scale size facilityand then building the telescope it's
 just a matter of time to build everythingand get it get it up for lunch so this


Speaker 0 :is
 an easy close engineering yes this is an engineering project

Speaker 1 :it's a real engineering project so i
 actually can tell you about two other projects that are not minei like to call starshade mine because
 it was my project that i helped make it mainstreamwhere that line is constantly shifting
 when i started when i got this leadership role on starshadei remember telling people about it and
 it was definitely not on the mainstream okay lineit was on the giggle factor side of the
 line and people would just laugh like that's dead like you could neverformation fly
 or they'd say why are you working on that that's just so not it's not this isso awesome


Speaker 0 :there's a there's a few things you've
 done in your life and that's when i firstsaw starshine i was like what really
 and then like it sinks in i mean it's the same thing i felt with like elonmusk or certain people who do crazy
 stuff like and then and they get they actuallymake it work
 i mean if you get started in formation flyingto like together i mean how awesome is
 that if you actually make that happen evenlike from a robot i'm sorry from the
 robotics perspective even if it doesn't give us good datathat's just like a cool thing
 to get out there i mean it's really exciting really cool so there's two

Speaker 1 :other topics that aren't mine but i
 still love them one of them let's just talk about itbriefly because it's not a probe but
 it's the idea to send a telescope very far away to 500 times the earth sundistance
 and this is way farther than the voyager spacecrafts are right nowand to use our sun as a gravitational
 lens to use our sun to magnify somethingthat's behind it
 it's got to sink in for a minute yeah

Speaker 0 :exactly but i mean
 i don't know what the physics of that is like how to use the sun in astronomy and

Speaker 1 :einstein thought about this initially
 we can use uh massive objects bend space and so light that should be travelinglike straight it actually
 travels around the warped space and

Speaker 0 :somehow
 you figure out a way to use that for magnification

Speaker 1 :you have a way to use that for
 magnification that's right there are galaxies uh that are lensso-called gravitational lens by
 intervening galaxy clusters actually and there aremicrolensing events where stars get
 magnified as an unseen gravitational lens starpasses in between us and that very
 distant star it's actually a real tool in astronomyyeah using gravitational lens
 to magnify because it bends more rays towards you than normally wouldyou normally see and again we're trying


Speaker 0 :to get more
 higher resolution images that are basically boiled down to light

Speaker 1 :well it boils down to light


Speaker 0 :and then you can maybe get more
 information about

Speaker 1 :well in this case you would ask me let's
 say if this thing could get built it wouldtake
 like something like they'd like to say 25 years to get from here to there25 years and then it could send some
 information back to us and then you'd say so sarah how many pixelsand i wouldn't say one or less than one
 i'd say you know it could be like 10 by 10 pixelsit could be 100 pixels which would be


Speaker 0 :awesome i mean it's still crazy that we
 can get a lot of information from that

Speaker 1 :crazy right and it's crazy for a lot of
 other reasons because again you have to line up the sun and your targetyou'd only have one telescope per target
 because every star is behind the sun in a different wayso it's a lot of complicated things but
 what about the second the second one it's called starshot you know starshotmeans like
 big dreams and it's an initiative by the breakthrough foundationand starshot is the concept to send
 thousands of little tiny spacecraft which they now call star chip so insteadof star ship it's star chip
 and there's a little chip and the star chipso like sending like thousands of little
 turtles being born they're not all going to make itmm-hmm because they used to send lots of
 them and each of these star chips once they're launched intoi guess low-earth orbit they will deploy
 a solar sail that's a few meters in diameter andthey'd use it on
 earth we would have a bank of this one is still a bit on the otherside of the line but we'd have a bank of
 telescopes with lasers there'd be like a gigawatt powerand these lasers would momentarily shine
 upwards and accelerate they'd hit these sailsthey'd be like a power source for the
 sail and would accelerate the sails to travelat about a 20th the speed of light


Speaker 0 :is that is that as crazy as it sounds


Speaker 1 :well
 like like any good well like any good engineering project it has to be brokendown into the crazy parts
 and the breakthrough initiative like to their huge credit is sponsoringyou know getting over these actually
 they've listed initially they listed 19 challengesyes it's broken down to concrete things
 like one of them is well you have to buy the land and make sure the airspace isokay
 with you sending up that much power overheadanother one is you have to have material
 on the sail where the lasers won't just uh vaporize itand well so there's a lot of a lot of
 issues but anyway these sails would be accelerated to 20th speed of lightand their journey to the nearest star
 would now wouldn't would no longer be tens of thousands of years but could be20 years okay 20. so it's not not as bad
 as tens of thousands yeah and this umthese thousands or whatever however many
 make it they'll go by the nearest star system and snap a few snap some imagesand radio the information back to earth
 because they're traveling so fast they can't slow down but they'll zoom by takesome photos
 send it back high res yeah but see just what i want you to pause on for a secondis that just by making that a real
 concept and the money given won't make it happenbut we'll but what it's done is it's
 planted the seed and it's shifted that line from what iscrazy to what is a real project it's
 shifted it just ever so slightly enough i think to plant the seed that wehave to find a way to somehow find a way
 to get there

Speaker 0 :that is again to stay on that that is so
 powerful take a big crazy idea andbreak it down into smaller crazy ideas
 order it in a list and knock it out one at a timeuh i don't know i've never heard
 anything more inspiring from an engineering perspectivebecause that's how you solve the
 impossible things so you open your new book discussingrogue planet pso j318 i never said this
 out loud 0.522 so a rogue planet whichis just this poetic beautiful vision of
 a planet that that as you right lurches acrossthe galaxy
 like a rudderless ship wrapped in perpetual darknessit's surface swept by constant storms
 as black skies raining molten iron just like the vision of that the scarythe
 the darkness the just how not pleasant it is for humanlife
 just the intensity of that metaphor i don't knowand the reason you use that
 is to paint in a feeling of loneliness and despair and despairand um
 why maybe on the planet side why does it feel maybe it's just me whydoes it feel so profoundly lonely
 on that kind of planet like what uh like what i think it's because we all

Speaker 1 :want to be a part of something
 a part of a family or a part of a communityor a part of something
 and so our solar system and by the way i onlyit's sort of like a like when you treat
 yourself to like eating an entire tub of ice cream like isometimes treat myself to imagine things
 like this and not just be so cut and dried butwhen you imagine that this plan is not
 because i don't want to give emotions to a planet per se but the planet's notpart of anything
 it's somehow probably um it's just all on its own just kind of out therewithout that warm energy from its sun
 it's just all alone out there to me it

Speaker 0 :was a little discovery
 that i actually feel pretty good at being part of the solar systemit felt like we have a sun we have like
 a little family and it felt like it sucked for the rogueplanet
 yeah to just floating about uh not floatingof flying uh rudderless
 by the way how many rogue planets are therein your sun you don't know totally i


Speaker 1 :mean there's some rogue planets
 that are just born on their own i know that sounds really weird to be how canyou be born an orphan
 but they just are because most planets are bornout of a disk of gas and dust around a
 star but some of these small planets are liketotally failed stars they're so failed
 they're just small planets on their own but we think that there's probablyhonestly there's another path to a rogue
 planet that's one that's been kicked out of its star systemby other planets like a game of billiard
 balls something just gets kicked out we actually think there's probably asmany rogue planets as stars


Speaker 0 :no flying out there um fundamentally
 alone so the book is uhas a memoir is about your life and it uh
 weaves both your fascination with planets outside the solar systemand the path of your life
 and you lost your husband which is a kind of central part of the bookthat created a feeling of the rogue
 planet by the way what's the name of the book

Speaker 1 :the name of the book is
 the smallest lights in the universe

Speaker 0 :what's up with the title what's the


Speaker 1 :meaning the title has a double meaning
 on the face of it it's the search for other earths earths areso dim compared to the big bright
 massive star beside them searching for the earth's is likesearching for
 the smallest lights in the universe it has this other meaning too i reallyhope that you or the other people
 listening never get to the place where you're justyou've fallen off the cliff into this
 horrible place of huge despair and once in a while you get a glimmer ofa better life of some kind of hope
 and those are also the smallest lights in the universe well maybe we can tell

Speaker 0 :the full story
 before we talk about the glimmer of hope um what did it feel liketo first find out that your husband mike
 was sick

Speaker 1 :it was incredibly frustrating like lots
 of us have had some kind of problem thatthe doctors completely ignore
 just that they kept blowing him off it's nothingare they paid to just say something i
 mean it's just insane i was just so angryand we finally got to a point where he
 was really sick he was like in bed not able to movebasically
 and it turned out all the things they ignored and not done any tests he hadlike a 100 percent blockage in his
 intestine like a hundred percent like nothingcould get out nothing could get in
 and it was pretty pretty shocking to even hear then that it could be nothing

Speaker 0 :what was the progression of it in the
 context of the maybe the medical system the doctors imean what did it feel like
 did you feel like a human being uh

Speaker 1 :i felt like a child like the doctors
 were trying to water down the real diagnosis or treatus like we couldn't know the truth or
 they didn't know you know i felt mixed like it's not agood situation if you think the doctor
 either has no idea what he or she is doingor if the doctor is purposely let's just
 say lying to you to sugarcoat it like i didn't know which one of it wasbut i knew it was one of those


Speaker 0 :what were what were the things he was
 suffering from

Speaker 1 :well initially he just had a random
 stomachache i hate to say that out loud because i know a lot of peoplewill have a random stomachache yeah but
 so he just had a bad stomach ache and thenthis is weird a few days later another
 bad stomachache kind of gets worse might go away for a few weeks might comeback and at the time all i knew was my
 dad had had that same thing not the same identical system but he hadthese really weird pains and he
 ended up having the worst diagnosis one of the worst diagnosis you can get froma random stomachache is pancreatic
 cancer because the time the pancreas like you can't feelanything so by the time you feel pain
 it's too late it's spread already so i was just like beside myself i'mlike this is like wow
 this guy he's a random stomachache all i know is another man i loved had a randomstomachache and it didn't end well


Speaker 0 :how did you deal with it emotionally
 psychologically intellectually as a scientist what wasthat like
 that that whole because it's not immediate it's a it's a long journey

Speaker 1 :it's a long journey and you don't know
 where the diagnosis is going so anyone who's suffered from a majorillness there's like always branches in
 the road so you know he had this intestinalblockage
 i can't imagine someone in their 40s having that and that be normal butthe doctor is like it could be nothing
 could just cut it out you don't need most of your intestines it's a repeatingpattern just cut that out it could be
 fine but it ended up not being fine and he was diagnosed as being terminally illwell it really changed my life in a huge
 way first of all i remember immediately one summer thesummer when this happened
 i started asking everyone i knew i would ask you i know it'smy job to put you on the spot i'd say
 you have one year to live or two or three what will you dodifferently about your life now
 lex you have one year to live what would you doi mean it's hard i don't know if you


Speaker 0 :want to answer no no no i think about it
 a lot i mean that's a really good thing to meditateon we can talk about
 maybe how uh why you bring that up what if it is or not a heavy questionbut
 i get uh i i think about mortality a lot andfor me it feels like a really good way
 to focus in on is what you're doing today the peopleyou have around you the family you have
 is it uh does it bring you joy does it bring youfulfillment
 and basically uh for me of long agotried to be ready to die any day
 so like today i you know i kind of woke up look if i was nervous about talkingto
 um i've i really admire your work and the book is very good and superexciting topic
 uh but then you know there's this also feeling likeif this is the last conversation i have
 in my life you know if i die today will this be let's be uh the rightlike am i glad today happened and it is
 and i am glad today uh happened so that that's the way and

Speaker 1 :that's so unique i never got that answer
 from a single person

Speaker 0 :the busyness of life there's goals
 there's dreams there's like planning

Speaker 1 :plans very few people make it happen
 that's what i learned and so a lot of these people oh like you

Speaker 0 :run out of time


Speaker 1 :it's not so much time but i'd come back
 later and be little okay why don't you do thatif that's what you would do if you're
 gonna die a year from now why don't you why don't you make it realsimple things spend more time with
 family like why don't you do that and no one had an answer it turns out unlessyou
 usually unless you have you really do have a pressing end of lifepeople don't do their bucket list or try
 to change their career and some people can't so we can'tlike for a lot of people they can't do
 anything about it and that's that's fine but the ones who cantake action for some reason never do and
 that was uh one of the ways that mike's death or at the time hisimpending death really really affected
 me because you know for these sick peoplewhat i learned he had a bucket list and
 he was able to do some of the bucket lists it was awesomebut he got sick pretty quickly so if you
 do only have a year to live it's ironic because you can't do youcan't do the things you wanted to do
 because you get too sick too fast

Speaker 0 :what were the bucket list things for you
 that you realize like what am i doing with my life

Speaker 1 :that was the major cons of him after he
 died i didn't know like i i was just lost because whensomething that profound happens
 all the things i was doing um most of the things i was doing were justmeaningless
 it was so tough to to find an answer for that and that's when i settled on i'mgonna
 devote the rest of my life to trying to find another earthand to find out to
 find that we're not alone

Speaker 0 :what is that longing for connection with
 others um what's that aboutwhat do you think why is that so full of
 meaning i don't know why i mean i think

Speaker 1 :it's
 how we're hardwired like one of my friends some time ago actually when mydad died
 he never heard someone say this before but he's like sarah you knowwhy are we evolved to take death so
 harshly like what kind of society would we be ifwe just didn't care people died
 like that would be a very different type of world how would we as a species havegot to where we are
 so i think that is tied hand in hand with why do wewhy do we seek connection it's just that
 we were talking about before that subconsciousness that we don'tunderstand


Speaker 0 :yeah coupled you know the other side the
 flip side of the coin of connection and love is a fear of lossit's like that was again i don't know
 that's what makes you appreciate the moment is that thething ends


Speaker 1 :yeah it's definitely a hard one the
 thing ends but and it's hard to not you you wouldn'twant to limit
 like it's like my dog who i love so much i'll start to crylike i can't think about the end i know
 he'll age much faster than i will and someday it will end right but it'stoo sad to think of
 but should i not have got a dog right which i've not brought this sort of joyinto my life because i know it won't be
 forever it's

Speaker 0 :well there's a there's a philosopher
 ernest becker who wrote a book denial of deathand just uh uh and warm with the cores
 and there's another book talks about terror management theorysheldon solomon i just talked to him
 a few weeks ago uh he's a brilliant philosopher a psychologist thattheir theory whatever you make of it is
 that um the fear of death is at the core ofeverything
 everything we do so like you're that you think you don't think about themortality of your dog
 but you do and that's what makes the experience richlike there's this kind of like in the
 shadows lurks the the knowledge that this won't lastforever
 and that makes every moment just special in some kind of uh weird way that it themoments are special for us humans
 i mean sorry to use romantic terms like love butwhat do you make what did you learn
 about love from from losing it from losing your husband

Speaker 1 :well i learned to love the things i have
 more i learn to love the people that i havemore and to not let the little things
 bother me as much what about the

Speaker 0 :rediscovery or like
 the discovery of the little lights um uh in the darkness soyou the book i think you
 brilliantly describe the dark parts of your journey uhbut maybe
 can you talk about how you were able to rediscover the lights

Speaker 1 :they came in many ways and the way like
 to think about it is like grief is an ocean you know with tinyislands
 of the little like like the little lights and eventuallythat ocean gets smaller and smaller and
 the islands like become continents with lakesso initially be like the children
 laughing one day or my colleagues at work who ralliedaround me
 and would take me away from my darkness to work on a projectlater on it turned out to be a group of
 women my age all widows all with children in my townand it would be even though it was a bit
 morose getting together um still very joyful at the same time

Speaker 0 :what was the journey of rediscovering
 love like for you so refining i meanis there some by way of advice or
 insight about how to um

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :how to rediscover the beauty of life of


Speaker 1 :life
 it's a hard one i think you just have to stay opento being positive and just to get out
 there

Speaker 0 :do you still think do you think about
 your immortality so you mentioned that that was a thingthat you would meditate on as a question
 when it was right there in in front of you but do you still think about it

Speaker 1 :i think i will after talking to you but
 no it's not really something i think about i mean i do think aboutthe search for another earth and will
 will i get there will i be able to concludemy search and is there one like as time
 goes by you know that window to solve thatproblem gets smaller


Speaker 0 :what would bring you again i apologize
 if this makes concrete the fact that life isfinite but what um
 what would bring you joy if we discovered while you're still

Speaker 1 :here will bring me joy finding another
 earth an earth like planet around a sun-like starknowing that there's at least one or
 more out there being able to see water that it hassigns of water and being
 able to see some gases that don't belong so i know that the searchwill continue after i'm gone enough to
 fuel the next generation

Speaker 0 :ah so just like opening the door and
 there's like this glimmer of what do you think it will take torealize that i mean we've talked about
 all these interesting projects starshade especiallybut is there something that you're
 particularly kind of uh hopeful about in the next 10 20 yearsthat might give us
 that that exact glimmer of hope that there's earth like planets out there

Speaker 1 :i have to i stand behind star shade in
 all cases so but there is this other kind of fieldthat i that everyone is involved in
 because star shade is hard earths are hard but there are there'sanother category of
 planet star type that's easier and these are planetsorbiting small red dwarf stars they're
 not earth-like at all think like earth cousin instead of earth twinbut there's a chance that we might
 establish that some of those have water and signs of life on themthat's nearer term than starshade and
 we're all working hard on that too

Speaker 0 :let me ask uh by way of recommendations
 i think a lot of people are curious about this kind of stuffwhat three books technical or fiction
 or philosophical or anything really uh had animpact on your life and
 and or you would recommend besides of course your book

Speaker 1 :there's one book i wish everyone could
 read i'm not sure if you've read it it's actually a children's book like a youngadult book
 it's called the giver yes

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and it is the book that kids in school
 read now and i only

Speaker 0 :sorry that that's not that's wow uh
 sorry that that caught me off guard uh so when i first came to this country ididn't speak much
 it's really what made me uh it had a profound impact on my life and i'm at areally important moment because they
 they give it to kids like i think middle school i thinkor maybe yes something like that


Speaker 1 :i'm so surprised you've even heard of


Speaker 0 :this book yeah so they give
 but like it's the value of giving the right book to a personat the right time uh i was as
 because it's very accessible do we want

Speaker 1 :to share what the story is without
 spoiling it

Speaker 0 :uh yeah you can without spoiling right
 it's follows this boy

Speaker 1 :in this very utopic society that's like
 perfect it's been all clean cut and made perfect actuallyand as he kind of comes of age he starts
 realizing something's wrong with his worldand so it's part of that question are we
 going to evolve this i mean this isn't what's there but it made me wonder youknow are we evolving to a better place
 is there a day when we can eliminate you know poverty and hunger and crimeand sickness in this book they pretty
 much have in the society that the boy's inand sort of follows him and he becomes a
 chosen one to be like a receiver the giver is theold wise man who
 retains some of the harshness of the outside world so that he can advise thepeople
 as the sort of boy comes of age and is chosen for the special role he finds theworld isn't what he expects
 and i don't know about you but it was so profound for me becauseit jolts you out of reality it's like oh
 my god what am i doing here i'm just going with the flowwith my society how do i think outside
 the box and the confines of my society which surely carries negative thingswith it that we don't realize today


Speaker 0 :yeah and also in the flip side of that
 is if you do take a step outside the box on occasionuh what's the psychological burden of
 that like is that is is that your is that astep you want to take is that the
 journey you want to take what is that life like i don't know i

Speaker 1 :felt like from the book you have to take
 it i found from the book i never thoughtlike now that you're saying it i see
 what you're saying the burden is huge but i always feellike the answer is yes you absolutely
 want to know what's out what's outside but you can't do that ifyou're very it's hard to be objective
 about your own reality

Speaker 0 :yeah i mean it's a very human instinct
 but uh it also the book kind of shows that it has an effect on youand this it's a really interesting
 question about our society taking a step out

Speaker 1 :it's by lois lowry i think
 is how you pronounce it i really do hope everyone created and it is a young adultbook but it's still
 it's incredibly i'm really glad i only read it because my kids got it forschool
 i just thought okay well why don't i just see what this is about and i justwow


Speaker 0 :yeah yeah i i think it's also the value
 of education i think i think i'm surprised you mentioned i'venever really mentioned to anybody
 i'm sure a lot of people had some experience like me and maybe

Speaker 1 :it's a generational thing though because
 like the book came out i think in the 90s soif you're older then like me that book
 didn't exist when we were in middle school soi just do think a lot of people won't
 have heard of it but it's an interesting

Speaker 0 :question of like
 those books i mean i'm reminded often i suppose the same is true with othersubjects but books
 are special at the early age like middle school maybe early high schoolthis those can change like the direction
 of your life and also certainly teachersthey can change completely the direction
 of life there's so many stories about teachers of mathematics teachers ofphysics
 of any kind of subjects basically changing the direction of a human's lifethat's like not to get on the
 uh the whole almost like a political thing butyou know we uh we undervalue teachers
 uh it's a special it's a special position that they holdso true yeah well i do have two other


Speaker 1 :books or two other things
 one is something i came across just a few days ago actuallyit's actually a film called picture a
 scientist and when you picture a scientist youprobably don't picture the
 women and women of color in this film and it is a way to get outside your boxi really think everyone interested in
 science even just peripherally should watch thisbecause it is shocking and sobering at
 the same time and it talks about how well i think oneof the messages across
 is you know we really are like i don't know if we're hardwired to just likepeople like ourselves
 but we're excluding a lot of people and therefore a lot of great ideasby not being able to think outside of
 how we're all stereotyping each other so it's it's it's hard to kind of conveythat and you can just say oh yeah i want
 to be more diverse i want to be more openbut it's a nearly impossible problem to
 solve and the movie really helps open people's eyes to it this book i putthird because unlike the giver people
 may not want to read it it's not as relevant butwhen i was in my early 20s i went to
 this big this like 800 people large conferencecall
 us run by the wilderness canoe associationin my hometown of toronto and there's a
 family friend there who i met and he said read this book it'll changeyour life and it actually changed my
 life and it was a book called sleeping islandby an author pg downs who
 just coincidentally lived in this area lived in the boston area he was ateacher
 i think at a private school and every summer he would go to canadawith a canoe often by himself and he
 wrote this book maybe in the 40s or 50s about a trip hetook in the late 1930s
 and it was i was just shocked that even at that time although that was a longtime ago
 there were large parts of canada that were untouched by white peopleand he went up there and interacted like
 with the natives he called the book it had a subtitle that was calledthere's something like journey in the
 barren lands and when you go up north in canada youpass the tree line just like on a
 mountain if you hike up a mountain you get so far north there aren't any treesand he wrote eloquently about the land
 and about being out there there weren't even any maps of theregion like in that time
 and i just thought to myself wow like that you could just take the summer offand explore by canoe
 and go and see what's out there and it led to mejust doing that that very thing of
 course it's different now but going out to where the road ends andputting the canoe in the water and just
 well we had to have a plan we didn't justexplore but go down this river rivers
 with rapids and travel over lakes and portages and justreally live


Speaker 0 :so just really explore screw it that
 doesn't like it doesn't

Speaker 1 :or just use from a topo map from a
 topographical map from the library and those things umthere were scary elements about of it
 out of it but part of the excitement or the joy or the desire wasto be scared
 like was to go out there and have live on the edge and persevere

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah and persevere yeah do you have an


Speaker 0 :advice
 that you would give to a young person todaythat would like to help you maybe
 on the planetary science side discover exoplanetsor maybe bigger picture just succeed in
 life

Speaker 1 :i do have some advice just to succeed
 it's tough advice in a way but it is to find something that youlove doing that you're also
 very good at in some ways the stars have to align because you've got to find thatthing you're good at or the range of
 things and it actually has to overlap withsomething that actually you love doing
 every day so it's not a tedious job that's thebest way to succeed


Speaker 0 :what were the signals that in your own
 life were there to make you realize you'regood at something that you're
 you're like what were you good at that made youuh pursue a phd and made you
 pursue the search i mean that was the

Speaker 1 :one sentence version in my case it was a
 long slog and there were a lot of things i wasn't good at initiallybut so initially you know i was good at
 high school math i was good at high school sciencei loved astronomy and i realized those
 could all fit together like the day i realized you could be an astronomer fora job
 it has to be one of my top days of my life i didn't know that you couldbe that for a job yeah i was good at all
 those things and although my dad wanted me to do something more practicalwhere he could be guaranteed i could
 support myself was another option but initially i wasn't that good atphysics it was a slog to just get
 through school and grad school is a very very long timebut ultimately when faced with a choice
 and i had the luxury of choosing knowing that i was good at something andalso loved it it really carried me
 through

Speaker 0 :now i asked some of the smartest people
 in the world the most ridiculous question uh we already talked about it alittle bit but let me ask uh
 again why why are we here so uh i think you've uh raised thisquestion when your presentations as like
 what one of the things that we kind of ashumans long to
 to answer and the search for exoplanets is kind of part of thatbut what do you think is the meaning of
 it all of life i wish i had a good

Speaker 1 :answer for you


Speaker 0 :i think you're the first person ever who
 refused to answer the question

Speaker 1 :it's not so much refusing i just yeah i
 mean i wish i had a better answer it's it's why we're here it's almost

Speaker 0 :like the meaning is uh
 wishing there was a meaning that we wishing wishing we knew

Speaker 1 :i love that that's a great way to that's
 a great way to say it

Speaker 0 :so like i said uh the book is excellent
 i admired you work from afar for a while i'm i think you're one ofthe
 the great stars at mit and makes me proud to bepart of the community so thank you so
 much for your work thank you for inspiring all of us thanks for talkingtoday
