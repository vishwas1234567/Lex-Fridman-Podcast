Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with ian
 hutchinson a nuclear engineer and plasma physicist at mit he has madea number of important contributions in
 plasma physics including the magnetic confinement of plasmasseeking to enable fusion reactions which
 happens to be the energy source of the stars to be usedfor practical energy production
 current nuclear reactors by the way are based on fission as we discussian has also written on the philosophy
 of science and the relationship between scienceand religion arguing in particular
 against scientism which is a negative description of theoverreach of the scientific method
 to questions not amenable to it on this latter topic i recommend two of hisbooks
 his new one can a scientist believe in miracles where he answers more than 200questions on all aspects of god and
 science and his earlier book on scientism calledmonopolizing
 knowledge as you may have seen already i work hard on having an open mindalways questioning my assumptions and in
 general marvel at the immense mystery of everything around usand the limitations of at least my
 mind i'm not religious myself in that i don't go to the synagogue a church ormosque
 but i see the beautiful bond in the community that religion at its best cancreate
 i also see both in scientists and religious leaders signs of arrogancehypocrisy
 greed and a will to power

 here's my conversation with ian hutchinsonmaybe it'd be nice to draw a distinction
 between nuclear physics and plasma physics what is thedistinction


Speaker 0 :nuclear physics is about the physics of
 the nucleus and my department department of nuclearscience and engineering at mit
 is very concerned about all the interactions andreactions and and consequences of things
 that go on in the nucleus including nuclear energyfission energy which is the nuclear
 energy that we have already and fusion energy which is the energysource of the sun and stars
 which we don't quite know how to turn into practical energyuh for humankind at the moment
 that's what my research has mostly been aimed atbut plasmas are essentially
 the fourth state of matter so if you think aboutsolid liquid gas plasma is the fourth
 of those states of matter and it's actually the state of matter which onereaches
 if one raises the temperature so cold things you know like ice are solidum liquids are hotter water
 and if you heat water beyond 100 degrees celsius it becomes gasuh well that's true of most substances
 and um plasma is a is a state of matter in which the electrons areunbound from the nuclei so they become
 separated from the nuclei and can move separatelyso we have positively charged nuclei
 and we have negatively charged electrons then the net isis still neutral electrically neutral
 but a plasma conducts electricity has all sorts of important propertiesthat are associated
 with that separation and that's what plasmas are all aboutand the reason why my department is
 interested in plasma physics very strongly is becausemost things well for one thing most
 things in the universe are plasma the vast majority of matter in theuniverse is plasma but but most
 particularly stars and the sun are plasmasbecause they're very hot and it's only
 in very hot states that nuclear fusion reactions take placeand we want to understand how to
 implement those kind of phenomena

Speaker 1 :on earth maybe another distinction we
 want to try to get at is a difference betweenfission and fusion
 as you mentioned fusion is the kind of reaction happening in the sun so what'svision and what's fusion


Speaker 0 :well fission is taking heavy elements
 like uranium and breaking them up and it turns out that that process ofbreaking up heavy elements releases
 energy

Speaker 1 :what does it mean to be a heavy helmet


Speaker 0 :it means that there are many
 nuclear particles in the nucleus itself neutrons and protons um in thein the nucleus itself so that in the
 case of um uranium there are 92protons in each nucleus and even more
 neutrons so that the total number of nucleonsin the nucleus nucleons is short for for
 either a proton or a neutron the total number you know might be 235that's
 u235 or it might be 238 that's u238 so those are heavy elementslight elements by contrast have very few
 nucleons protons or neutrons in the nucleushydrogen is the lightest nucleus it has
 one proton there are actually slightly heavier formsof hydrogen isotopes deuterium has
 a proton and a neutron and tritium has a proton and two neutrons so it hastotal of three
 nucleons in the new in the nucleus well taking light elementslike isotopes of hydrogen and not
 breaking them up but actually fusing them together reacting themtogether to produce heavier elements
 typically helium okay which is helium is a nucleus which hashas two protons and two neutrons
 that also releases energy and that and that or reactions like thatmaking heavier elements from lighter
 elements is what mostly powers the sun and starsboth fusion and fission release
 approximately a million times more energy per unit mass than chemicalreactions
 so a chemical reaction means take hydrogen takeoxygen react them together let's say and
 get water that releases energy the energyreleased in a chemical reaction like
 that or the burning of coal or on oil or whatever else is about amillion times less
 per unit mass than what is released in nuclear reactions

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :so but it's hard to do it requires
 very high energy of impact and actually it's very easy tounderstand why and that is that
 those two nuclei if they're both let's sayhydrogen nuclei one is let's say
 deuterium and the other is let's say tritiumthey're both electrically charged and so
 the and they're positively charged so they theylike charges repel everyone knows that
 right so basically to get them close enoughtogether to react
 you have to overcome the repulsion the electric repulsionof the two um nuclei from one another
 and you have to get them extremely close to one another in order for the nuclearforces to overtake
 the electrical forces and and actually form a new nucleusand so one requires very high energies
 of impact in order for reactions to takeplace and those high energies of impact
 correspond to very high temperatures

Speaker 1 :of random motion so that's why you can
 do something like that in the sun so we can build the sunthat's one way to do it
 but uh on earth how do you create a fusion[Laughter]


Speaker 0 :reaction yeah well nature engineering
 nature's fusion uh reactors are indeed the starsand uh they are very hot in the set in
 the center and re and they reach the point wherethey
 release more energy from those reactions than they lose by radiation andtransport to the surface
 and so forth and that's a state of ignitionand and that's what we have to achieve
 to to give net energy it's like lighting afire
 if you if you have a if you have a bundle of sticks and you hold a match upto it
 and you see smoke coming from the sticks but you take the match away and theand the and the sticks just fizzle out
 that's not the reason they did it fizzled out isthat yes they were burning
 there was smoke coming from them but they were not ignitedbut if you are able to take the match
 away and they keep burning and they are generating enough heatto keep themselves hot and hence keep
 the reactions going that's chemical ignition well what weneed to do
 what the stars do in order to generate nuclear fusion energy isthey are ignited they are generated
 enough energy to keep themselves hot and that's what we've got to do on earthif we're going to make
 fusion work on earth but it's much harder to doon earth than it is you know in a star
 because you know we need temperatures of order tens of millions ofdegrees celsius in order for the
 reactions to go fast enough to generate enoughelectricity to keep it
 or enough energy to keep it going and and so um if you've got something that'stens of millions of degrees
 celsius and you want to keep it all together and keep the heat in longenough
 to have enough reactions taking place you can't just put it in a bottleyou know plastic or glass it would be
 gone you know it's in milliseconds um soum you have to have some non-material
 mechanism of confining the plasma in the case of stars that non-materialforce
 is gravity so gravity is what holds a star together it's whatholds the plasma in long enough for it
 to react and and and sustain itself bythe the fusion reactions but on earth
 gravity is extremely weak i mean i don't mean to say we don't fall yes we fallbut the the mutual gravitational
 attraction of small objects is very weak comparedwith the electrical repulsion or any
 other force that you can think about on earth and so we need a stronger forceto keep the plasma together to confine
 it and the predominant attemptat making fusion work on earth is to use
 magnetic fields to confine the plasma and that's whati've worked on for much
 essentially most of my career is to understandhow we can and how best we can confine
 these incredibly hot gases plasmas using magnetic fields with the ultimateobjective
 of releasing fusion energy on earth and you know generating electricity with itand powering our society with it


Speaker 1 :a dumb question so on top of the
 magnetic fields do you also need the plastic waterbottle walls or is it purely magnetic


Speaker 0 :fields
 well actually what we do need walls um those walls must be kept away fromthe plasma because otherwise they'd be
 melted or the plasma must be kept away from them insideinside of them but the main purpose of
 the walls is not to keep the plasma in it's tokeep the atmosphere out
 so if we want to do it on earth where there's airwe want the plasma to consist of
 hydrogen isotopes or other things the things we're trying to reactand by the way the density
 of those plasmas at least in magnetic confinement fusionis very low it's maybe a million times
 less than the density of air in this roomso in order for a fusion reactor like
 that to work you have to keep all of the air out andjust keep the plasma in so yes there are
 other things but those are things that are relativelyeasy i mean making a vacuum
 these days is technologically quite quite straightforward we know how to dothat
 okay what we don't quite know how to do is to makea confinement uh device that
 isolates the plasma well enough so that itso that it's able to keep itself burning
 with its own reaction

Speaker 1 :so maybe can you talk about what a


Speaker 0 :takamaka is
 the russian acronym from which the word tokamak is built just means toroidalmagnetic chamber
 so it's a toroidal chamber taurus is is a geometric shape which is like adoughnut with a hole down the middle
 okay and so it's the so it's the meat of the doughnutokay that's the taurus um and it's
 and it's got a magnetic field so that's really all takamakuh means but the particular
 configuration um that we're the that is verywidespread and there's the sort of
 best prospect in the least in the near term for making fusion energy workis one in which there's a very strong
 magnetic field the the long way around thedoughnut around the torus um so you've
 got to imagine that there's this doughnut shape with an embedded magneticfield just going round and round
 the long way the the big advantage of thatis that plasma particles
 are when they're in a in the presence of a magnetic fieldfeel strong forces from the magnetic
 field and those forces make the particles gyrate around thedirection
 of the magnetic field line so basically the particles follow helical orbits likelike a following like a spring that's
 directed along the magnetic field well if you make the magnetic field goin inside this toroidal chamber and just
 simply go round and round the chamber then because of this helical orbitthe particles can't move fast across the
 magnetic field but they can move very quickly along themagnetic field
 and if you have a magnetic field that doesn't leave the chamberit doesn't matter if they move along the
 magnetic field it does it means it doesn't mean they're goingto exit the chamber
 but if you just had a straight magnetic field as you you know for examplecoming from um you know a bar a
 helmholtz coil or or a bar magnet then you'd have to haveends it would come would come to the end
 ends of the chamber somewhere in the and the particles would hit the ends andand they would lose their energy so
 that's why it's toroidal and that's why we have a strong magneticfield it's
 providing a confinement against motion in the in the direction that would leadthe particles to leave the chamber
 it turns out that then here we're getting a little bit technical but itturns out that
 a toroidal field alone is not enough and so you need morefields to produce true true confinement
 of plasma and we get those by passing acurrent as well
 through the plasma itself i can make

Speaker 1 :sure it stays on track


Speaker 0 :well that what that does is makes the
 field lines themselves into much bigger helices andthat for reasons that are too
 complicated to explain that clinches the confinement of theparticles
 at least in terms of their single particle orbits so they don't leave thechamber


Speaker 1 :and so when the particles are flying
 along this uh this this doughnut the inside of thedonut
 uh are they what's where's the generation of the energy coming from arethey smashing


Speaker 0 :into each other yeah eventually i mean
 in a fusion reactor there will be deuterons and triti andtritons and they will be
 smashing in they will be very hot they'll be 100 million degreescelsius or something so they're moving
 thermally with very large thermal energiesin random directions and they will
 collide with one another and have fusion reactions when thosefusion reactions take place
 energy is released large amounts of energy is released in the form ofparticles
 one of the particles that's released is an alpha particle which is also chargedand it's also confined
 and that alpha particle stays in the in the in the doughnut and heats the otherparticles that are in that doughnut
 so it transfers its energy to those and they it keeps them hotthere's there's some leaking of heat all
 the time a little bit of radiation some transport and so forth there's alsoa neutron released from that reaction
 the neutron carries out four-fifths of the fusion energyand that will have to be captured in a
 blanket that surrounds the chamber in which wetake the energy drive
 some kind of electrical generator from you know thermal thermalengine
 um gas turbine or something like that and power the power you got energy

Speaker 1 :so where do we stand where do we stand
 on getting this thing to be uh somethingthat actually works it generates energy


Speaker 0 :yep
 well um there have been experiments that have generatednet nuclear energies or nuclear powers
 in the vicinity of um you know a few tens of megawattsfor a few seconds so that's
 you know 10 megajoules that's not much energyit's a few doughnuts worth of energy
 okay yeah literal donut that's right umbut um but we have studied how well
 tokamax can confine plasmas and so we nowunderstand in in rather great detail
 um the way they work and we're able to predict what isgoing to be required in order to build a
 tokamak that becomes self-sustaining that that becomes essentially ignitedor very so close to ignited that it
 doesn't matter and and at the moment at least if youuse the modest magnetic field
 values still very strong but but limited limited magnetic field valuesyou have to build a very big device and
 so we are at the moment worldwide fusion research isat the moment in the process of building
 a very big experiment that's located in the south of franceit's called eta
 i-t-e-r which means the way or just means the international tokamakexperimental reactor if you like
 um and that experiment is designed to reach this burning plasma stateand to generate about 500
 megawatts of fusion power for hundreds of seconds at a time it'llstill only be
 an experiment it won't put electricity on the grid or anything like thatit's it's to figure out what whether it
 works and and with what the remaining engineering challenges are it's ascientific experiment
 it won't be engineered to run round the clock andand so on and so forth which ultimately
 one one needs to do in order to make something that'spractical for generating electricity
 but it will be the first demonstration on earthof a controlled fusion reaction reaction
 for you know long time time periods is

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :that exciting to you
 uh it it it's been an objective that is in many ways motivated my entire careerand the career career of many people
 like me in the field um i have to admit thoughthat one of the problems with eta is
 that it's an extremely big and expensive andlong time to build experiment and so it
 won't even come into operation until about 2025 even though it's beenbeing built for
 10 years and it's been it was designed for 30 years before thatright and so that's actually one of the
 big disappointments of my career in a certain sense which is that wewon't get to
 a burning fusion reaction until well past the firstoperation of eater and whether i'm alive
 or not i don't know but i certainly will be well and trulyretired by the time that happens
 and so when i realized maybe some years ago that that was going to be the caseit was a discouragement to me let's put
 it like that

Speaker 1 :but if we can try to look maybe
 in a ridiculous kind of way look into uh 100 years from now 200 years 500 yearsfrom now
 and we you know there's folks like elon musk uh trying to uh travel outside thesolar system
 i mean the amount of energy we need for some of the exciting things we want todo
 in this world if we look again 100 years from nowuh seems to be a very large amount
 so do you think fusion energy will eventuallyuh sometime into your retirement uh
 will be basically uh behind most of the things we do look i

Speaker 0 :absolutely
 think that fusion research is completely justified in fact we shouldbe spending more time and effort on it
 than we currently do but it isn't going to be a magic bulletthat somehow
 solves all the problems of energy by the way that's a generic statement you canmake about
 any energy source in my view i think it's a grave mistake to think thatscience
 of any sort is suddenly going to find a magic bullet for meeting all the energyneeds of society or any of the other
 needs of society by the way but and we can talk about that hopefullylater
 but but but but fusion is very worthwhile and we should be doing itum and and so my disappointment
 that i just expressed was in a certain sense of personal disappointmenti do think that fusion energy is a
 terrific challenge it's very difficult to bringthe energy source of the sun and stars
 down to earth this does contrast in a certain sensewith fission energy by contrast fission
 energy efficient to build a fission reactorproved to be amazingly easy
 you know we did it um within a few years of discovering nuclear fission peoplehad
 figured out how to build a reactor and did soum you know during the second world war


Speaker 1 :which is by the way
 fission is how the current nuclear power

Speaker 0 :plants work yeah
 and so we have uh nuclear energy today because fission uh reactors arerelatively easy to build you've got to
 have what's hard is getting the materials okay and that's just aswell because if everyone could get those
 materials you know there would be weapons proliferation and so forthbut it wasn't um all that long um
 after even the discovery of nuclear fissionthat fission reactors were built and
 fission reactors of course operated before we had weaponsum so um
 i think nuclear power is obviously important tomeet the energy challenges of our
 age it is completely intrinsically completelyuh co2 emissions free
 and in fact the wastes that come from nuclear power whether it's fission orfusion for that matter
 are so moderate in quantity that that we shouldn't really be worriedabout them
 um i mean yes fission products are highly radioactive andand we need to keep them away from
 people but there's so little of them it's that keeping them away from peopleis not particularly difficult
 and so while people complain a lot about thethe drawbacks of fish and energy um
 i think most of those complaints are ill-informedum we can talk about you know the the
 challenges and the disasters if you like ofuh off of fission reactors but i think
 fission in the near term offers a terrific opportunityfor environmentally friendly energy
 which in which in the world as a whole is rapidly beingtaken advantage of you know china and
 india and places like that are rapidly building fission plantswe're not rapidly building fission
 plants in the u.s although we are actuallybuilding two at the moment
 um two new ones um but we do still get 20 of our electricity from fish andenergy and we could get a lot more


Speaker 1 :so it's clean energy so it's clean
 energy now now again the concern is there's a verypopular
 hbo show and just came out on chernobyl uh there's the three mile island there'sfukushima that's the most recent
 disaster so there's a kind of a concern of umyeah i mean nuclear disasters
 is that what do you make of that kind of uh concern especially if we look intothe future of fission energy based uh


Speaker 0 :reactors
 well first of all let me say one or two words about the contrast between fissionand fusion and then we'll come on to the
 question of the disasters and so forth fission does havesome drawbacks and they're
 and they're largely to do with four four main areas one is do we have enoughuranium or other
 fissile fuels to to supply our energy needsfor a long time the answer to that is
 that we know we have um enough uranium to support fissionenergy
 worldwide for thousands of years but maybe not for millions of years okayso that's resources um secondly
 there there are issues to do with wastes fission wastesare highly radioactive and some of them
 are volatile and so for example um infukushima the the problem was
 that some fraction of the fish and waste were volatilizedand went out as a cloud and and polluted
 air areas with um cesium 137 strontium 90 and things like thatso that's a challenge of fission um
 there's a problem of safety uh beyond that and that isthat um in fission it's hard to turn the
 reactor off when you turn when you stop the nuclearreactions
 there is still a lot of heat being liberated from the fission productsand that is actually what the problem
 was at fukushima the fukushima reactors were shut downthe moment that the earthquake took
 place and they were shut down safely what thenhappened
 after that fukushima was you know there were there was this enormoustidal wave um many tens of meters high
 that came through and destroyed the electricitygrid feed to the fukushima reactors and
 their cooling was then turned off and it wasthe after heat
 of the turned off reactors that eventually caused the problems thatled to release and so that so that is
 that's a safety concern and then and thenfinally there's a problem of
 proliferation and that is that fission reactors needfissile fuel
 and the technologies for producing the underenriching and so forth the fuels can be
 used can be can be um by by bad actorsto generate um the materials needed for
 a nuclear weapon and that's a very very serious concern so those arethe four problems
 fusion has major advantages in respect ofall of those problems it has more uh
 longer term um fuel resources it has far more benign wasteissues the react the radioactivity from
 fusion reactions is at least a hundred times less than it is from fissionreactions
 it has um no none essentially none of thisafter heat problem because it doesn't
 produce fission products that are highly radioactive and generating theirown heat
 when it's turned off in fact the hard part of fusion is turning it on notturning it off
 and and finally you don't need the same uhfission technology to do to make uh
 fusion work and so it there it's got terrific advantages fromthe point of view of proliferation
 control so those are the those are four mainissues which make fusion seem attractive
 technologically um because they address some of theproblems of fission energy
 i don't mean to say that fission energy is overwhelmingly problematicbut clearly there have been catastrophes
 associated with fission reactors fukushima actually is i think in manyways
 often overstated as a disaster because after allnobody was killed by the reactors
 essentially zero and that's in the contextof a disaster a tsunami
 that killed between 15 and 20 000 people instantaneous more or lessinstantaneously
 so you know in the scale of risks um one should take the view that uhin my in my in my estimation that um
 fission energy came out of that looking pretty good okayof course that's not the popular
 conception okay

Speaker 1 :yes that's gonna i mean with a lot of
 things that threaten our well-being we seem to be very uh baduh users of data we seem to be very
 scared of uh shark attacks and not at all scaredof
 car accidents and this kind of miscalculation andi think from everything and i understand
 uh nuclear energy efficient based energygoes into that category
 it's one of the safest one of the cleanest forms of energyand yet the pr uh
 whoever does the pr for nuclear energy is not uhhas a hard job ahead of them at the


Speaker 0 :moment well i think part of that is
 their association with nuclear weapons right because when you say the wordnuclear people don't instantly think
 about nuclear energy they think about nuclear weaponsand and so there is you know perhaps
 um a natural tendency to do that but yes i agree with you people are verypoor at estimating risks and they react
 emotionally not rationally in most of these situations

Speaker 1 :can we talk about nuclear weapons just
 for a little bit so fission is the kind of reactionthat's central to the nuclear weapons we
 have today

Speaker 0 :that's what sets them off that's what


Speaker 1 :sets them off
 so if we look at the hydrogen bomb maybe you can say how these different

Speaker 0 :weapons work so the earliest nuclear
 weapons the the nuclear bombs that were dropped onjapan etc etc
 were pure fission weapons they used uh enriched uranium or plutoniumand their energy is essentially entirely
 derived from fission reactions butit was early realized that more energy
 was available if one could somehow combine a fissionbomb
 with um fusion reactions um because the fusion reactionsgive more energy per unit mass than
 than fission reactions and these were this was calledthe super you might have heard of the
 expression the super or more simply hydrogen bombs okay umbombs which use isotopes of hydrogen and
 the fusion reactions associated with

Speaker 1 :them
 like you said it's hard to turn on it's

Speaker 0 :hard to turn on because you need very
 high temperatures and you need confinement of thatlong enough for the reactions to take
 place and so a bomb actually a thermonuclear bombor a hydrogen bomb
 has essentially a chemical implosionwhich then sets off a fission
 explosion which then sets off and compresses hydrogen isotopesand other things which i don't know
 because i don't i've never had a security clearance okay so i so i can'tbetray any
 secrets about weapons because i've never been a party to them butbecause i know a lot about this problem
 i can guess okay um and sets offfusion reactions in the middle okay so
 that's basically it's that sequence of things whichproduce these enormous
 you know multi-megaton uh bombs that have very large yields umand so fusion alone can't get can't get
 you there it is actually possible to set off or totry to set off
 little fusion bombs alone without the surrounding fission explosionand that is what is called laser fusion
 so another approach to fusion which actually ismostly researched in the
 weapons complex the national labs and so forthbecause it's more associated with the
 technology of of weapons is inertial fusion so if if you decideinstead of
 trying to make your plasma just sit there in this taurus in the in thetokamak and
 be controlled steady state with a magnetic field if you if you're willingto accept that
 i'll just set off an explosion okay and then i'll gather the energy from thatsomehow i don't quite know how but let's
 not ask that question too much um then it is possibleto imagine generating fusion alone
 explosions and and the way you do it is you takesome small amount of deuterium tritium
 fuel you bombard it with energy from allsides
 and this is what the lasers are used for extremely powerful at laserswhich compresses the pe the pelleted
 fusion and heats it it compresses it to such ahigh
 density and temperature that the reactions take place very very quicklyand in fact they can take place so
 quickly that they're it's all over with before the thingflies apart


Speaker 1 :wow and that is heated up really fast


Speaker 0 :that is inertial


Speaker 1 :fusion okay is that useful for
 energy generation not yet

Speaker 0 :i mean there are those people who think
 it will be but you may have heard of the big experiment called the nationalignition facility which was built at
 livermore starting in the late 1990s and has been inoperation since
 around about 2010. it was designed in with the claim that it would reachignition fusion ignition
 in this pulsed form where the reactions have got over withso quickly before the thing whole thing
 flies apart it didn't actually reach ignition and idoesn't look as if it will although you
 know we never know maybe people figure out how to make it work betterbut the answer is in principle it seems
 possible to reach ignition in this way maybe notwith that particular laser facility


Speaker 1 :are you surprised that uh
 we humans haven't destroyed ourselves giventhat we've invented such powerful tools
 of destruction like what do you make of the the factthat for many decades
 we've had nuclear weapons now speaking about estimating riskat least to me it's exceptionally
 surprising i was born in the soviet unionthat um that big egos
 of the big leaders when rubbing up against each other have not created uhthe kind of destruction
 one was everybody was afraid of for

Speaker 0 :decades
 well i must say i'm extremely thankful that it hasn't i don't know whether i'msurprised about it
 i've never thought about it from the point of view ofis it surprising that we've we've
 avoided it i'm just very thankful that we have i think that thereis a sense in which cooler heads have
 prevailed at crucial moments i think there is alsoa sense in which you know mutually
 assured destruction um has in fact worked asa policy to restrain the great powers
 from going to war and in fact you know thethe the fact that we haven't had
 a world war you know since the 1940s is perhaps even attributable tonuclear weapons in a kind of strange and
 peculiar way but i think humans are deeply uh flawedand sinful people and i certainly don't
 feel gap that we're guaranteed that it's going to go on like this

Speaker 1 :and we'll talk about the sort of the
 biggest picture view of it all uh but let me just ask in terms of yourworries
 of if we look 100 years from now we're in the middle ofwhat is now a natural pandemic that from
 the looks of it it fortunately is not as bad as it couldhave possibly been if you look at the
 spanish flu if you look at the history of pandemicsif you look at all the possible
 pandemics that could have been that that folks like bill gates are exceptionallyterrified about we've
 uh i know many people are suffering uh but it's it's it's better than itcould have been uh so
 and now we're talking about nuclear weapons in terms of existential threatsto us
 as sinful humans uh what worries you the mostis it nuclear weapons is is it
 natural pandemics engineered pandemics nanotechnology in my field of artificialintelligence some people
 are afraid of uh killer robots and robots yeahis there do you think in those
 existential terms uh and and do any aspect do any of those

Speaker 0 :things worry you
 i am certainly not confident that my children and grandchildren willexperience the benefits of civilization
 that i have enjoyed i think it's possible for our civilizations to breakdown
 catastrophically i also think that it's possible for ourcivilizations to break down
 progressively and i think they will if we continue to have the explosion ofpopulation on the planet that we
 currently have i mean it's quite it's quitewrong to think of our problems as mostly
 being co2 if we can just solve co2 then we can goon
 having this you know continually expanding economyeverywhere in the world of course you
 can't do that okay i mean there is a finite you knowbearing capacity of our planet


Speaker 1 :on the resources of our planet on the


Speaker 0 :resources of our planet
 and and we can't continue to do that so i think there are lots of technicalreasons
 why um a continually expanding economy and and uh and civilizationis impossible and therefore um
 actually i'm as much nervous about the fact that ourpopulation is eight billion or something
 uh right now worldwide as i am about um the fact thatyou know a few million people would be
 would be killed by covet 19. i mean i don't want to becallous about this but from the big
 picture it seems like that's much more of a problemoverpopulation
 people not dying is ultimately more of a problemuh than people dying um so you know that
 probably sounds incredibly callousy or to listeners but i think it's simply youknow a sober assessment of the situation


Speaker 1 :is there is there ways from
 the way those eight billion or seven billion or whatever the number islive that could make it sustainable
 uh you know because you've kind of implied there's a kind of uhwe have especially in the west this kind
 of capitalist view of uh really consuming a lot of resources isthere a way to
 like if you could change uh one thing or a few things what would youchange to make this life make it look
 more likely that your grandchildren have a better life than you well okay so

Speaker 0 :let's talk a bit about energy because
 that's something i know a lot a lot about having thought about it most of mycareer
 in order to reach a steady-state co2 levelokay that's acceptable in terms of
 global climate change and so on and so forthwe need to reduce our
 carbon emissions by at least a factor of 10 worldwideokay what's more
 you know um the average energy consumption and hence co2emission of people in the world
 is less than a tenth of what we per capita of than what we havein the west in america and europe and so
 forth so if you have in mind some utopia inthe future where we can where we've
 reached a sustainable use of energy and we've also reacheda situation in which there's far
 less inequity in the world in the sense that people haveshare the energy resources more
 uniformly then what what that is equivalent towould be to reduce
 the co2 emissions in western economies not by a factor of 10but by a factor of 100 in other words
 has to go down to one percent of what it is nowokay yeah so you know when people talk
 about uh you know let's use natural gasbecause you know maybe it
 only uses 60 of the energy of coal it's complete nonsense we that's not noteven scratching the surface of what we
 would need to do so you know is that going to be feasiblei i i very much doubt it
 and therefore i actually doubt that we can reachum a level of energy
 of fossil energy use that is one percent of the current use in the west withouttotally dramatic changes either in
 you know our society our use of of energy and so forth which actuallyof course is much of that energy is used
 for producing food and so on and so forth so it's actuallynot so obvious that we can we can get we
 can cut down our energy usage by that factoror we've got to reduce the human


Speaker 1 :population population
 so you run up against that number that's increasing stilland you don't think that could be it's
 depressing no it's not uh it's not it's not it's not depressingit's um
 it's difficult like many truths are uh do you do you have a hope uh that therecould be a technological solution


Speaker 0 :in short no there is no technological
 solution to for example for population control imean we have the technology
 just you know to prevent ourselves bearing children that's not a problemtechnology's in okay solved
 the challenge is society the challenges human choices the challenges almostentirely
 human and sociological not technology not technology and when people thoughttalk about energy they
 they think that there's some kind of technological magic bullet for this butthere isn't
 okay and and there isn't for the reasons i just mentionednot because it's obvious there isn't but
 actually there isn't uh and and in in any case umthat it's true of energy it's true of
 pollution it's true of human population it's true ofmost of the big challenges in our
 society are not scientific or technologicalchallenges
 they're human sociological challenges and that's why i think it's a terriblemistake
 um even for folks like me who work at you knowwell the high temple of science and
 technology in in america and maybe in the galaxyyeah i mean
 you know it's it's it's mit it's mit

Speaker 1 :best university in the world


Speaker 0 :it's it's a terrible mistake if we give
 the impression that technology is going to solve it alltechnology will make
 tremendous contributions and i think it's it's worth working on itbut it's a disaster if you think it's
 going to solve all of our problems and and actually um you know i've written awhole book about
 the question of of scientism and the and the overemphasis on science both as a way of of
 solving problems through technology but also as a way ofgaining knowledge i think it's not
 all of the knowledge there is either

Speaker 1 :yeah i think that book
 and uh your journey there is fascinating so maybe you can go there cancan you tell me about your on a personal
 side your the personal journey of your faith ofchristianity and your relationship with
 uh with god with religion in general

Speaker 0 :yeah in my in my latest book uh can a
 scientist believe in miracles i i i give a first i devote most of thefirst chapter to telling how
 how i became a christian um why i became a christian ii didn't grow up as a christian which is


Speaker 1 :fascinating i mean you didn't grow up as
 a christian so you you've discovered the beauty of uh godand physics at the same time


Speaker 0 :that's a very poetic way of putting it
 but yes i would accept that um i became a christian when i was anundergraduate at cambridge university
 um i i had you know i had gone to a school in which there was religionkind of was part of the society there
 were prayers and at the at the at the daily you knowgathering of the
 of the students uh the assembly of the students um but ibut i didn't really believe it i just
 sort of went along with it and it wasn't particularlyyou know aggressive or benign you know
 blind it just sort of was there um but i didn't believe it um i didn'tdidn't make much sense to me but when i
 but i came across christians from time to time and when i went to cambridgeuniversity
 um two of my closest friends who turned out were christians and i thinkit was that
 was the most important influence on me umthat that here were uh
 two people who were really smart like me i i'm giving you my yeah my impressionat the time the way i the way i felt at
 the time um and and they thought christianity madesense and and you know
 testified to its significance in their lives andso that was a very important influence
 on me and i and ultimately i mean the reason ii i hadn't i hadn't i didn't see
 christianity as some kind of great evil the way it's sometimes portrayed by theby the radical atheists of this century
 i mean i think that's nonsense but but but i so i think there were certainattractive things if you go to a
 university like cambridge you know you're surrounded byby by western culture you know from from
 about you know the 15th century onwards andthat saturated
 with christian art and architecture and so forth and so it's hard it's hardnot to recognize
 that christianity is in fact the foundation of western society in westernculture
 well western civilization um so so i i mean maybe i was in that sensefavorably
 disposed towards christianity as a religion but as a personal faith itdidn't mean anything to me but i became
 convinced really of two things one is thatthe evidence for the resurrection of
 jesus christ is actually rather good i mean it's not a proof it's not kind ofsome some kind of scientific demonstrate
 or mathematical demonstration but it's actually extremely good it'snot scientific evidence by and large
 it's historical evidence historical evidence yeahum so that was one thing and the other
 thing that came to me when i was at cambridge itbecame clear
 that christianity ultimately is not you know some kind of moraltheory or philosophy or something like
 that it is or elite or at least it claims tobe um
 a personal relationship with god which is made possibleyou know by um what jesus did and on the
 cross and and his life and his teaching and andit's a personal call
 to a relationship with god and that had i'd never thought of it inthose terms when i was you know
 when i was younger and that that that thought becameum attractive to me i mean i i think
 most people find the person of christ and his teachings you know compellinginsert
 in a certain sense what do you mean by

Speaker 1 :personal do you mean personal
 for you like a relationship like it's a meditativelike you specifically you even have
 a connection uh with god uh and and then the other side you saypersonal um
 with the actual body the person of jesus christso all of those things what do you mean
 by personal connection and why that was

Speaker 0 :me well so as well for the stupid
 question no that's okay no problem as a christiani believe that i have a relationship
 with god which is best expressed by saying thatit's personal
 and that comes about because you know jesus through his acts hasreconciled me with god me a sinner
 me someone full of of of of sins of of failings of ways in whichi don't live up to even my own ideals
 let alone the ideals of a holy god have been reconciled to the creator ofeverything
 um and and so christians myself included believe that prayer isin a certain sense a connection with god
 and there are times when i have felt you know that godspoke to me i don't mean necessarily
 orally in words but showed me things or enlightened me orinspired me
 in ways um that um i i attribute to him so i see it as aas a two-way you know relationship in a
 certain sense of course it's a very asymmetrical relationship butnevertheless christians think that it's
 a two-way it's a two-way street we're not justtalking into the air when we
 say we want i'm going to pray for someone

Speaker 1 :in this two-way communication uh
 is there a way that you could try to describe on a podcastwhat is god what is god like
 uh in your view if if you try to describe is it a forceum is it a is it uh for you
 intellectually is a set of metaphors that you use to reasonabout the world is it um
 is it uh is it is it kind of a computer that does some computation that's theinfinitely powerful computer
 uh or is it like santa claus a guy with a with a beardon the cloud like uh i don't mean um
 i don't mean what god actually is i mean in your limiteduh cognitive capacity as a human
 what do you actually uh what do you find helpful for thinking of what godactually looks like what is


Speaker 0 :god well let me start by saying none of
 the above okay i mean clearly god in the christian godum uh the god of abraham isaac and jacob
 etc um it is is not any of those thingsbecause all of those things you just
 mentioned are phenomena or or orentities in the created world and the
 most fundamental thing about monotheism as you knowabraham and moses and so forth handed it
 down is that god is not an entity withinthe creation within the universe that
 god is the creator of it all and that's what genesis first twochapters of genesis is really about
 it's it's not it's not about telling us you know how god created the world it'sabout telling
 us and telling the early hebrews that god createdthe world okay and that therefore he is
 not you know simply an entity within it on the other hand you know our finiteminds
 have a pretty hard time encompassing that soso one has to therefore work in terms of
 metaphors and images and and so forth and umi think we would know very little about
 who god is um if we if it was simply uh if we were simply left to our owndevices
 you know if if we were just you know here you are you're in the universetry to figure out who who made it and uh
 and so forth well you know philosophers think they cando a little bit of that maybe uh and
 theologians think that they can do a little bit morebut um but christians think
 uh that god has actually helped us along a lotby revealing himself and and we say
 that he's revealed himself supremely in the person of jesus christum and so you know when jesus says to
 his disciples if you've seen me you've seen the fatherthen that is in a certain sense a watch
 word for answering this question for christiansit is that supremely if we want to
 help ourselves understand who god really iswe look to jesus we look to what he did
 we look to what he said uh and so forth umand we believe that he
 is one with the father and that's why we believe you know in the trinity i meanit's basically because
 um that revelation is extremely um central to christian belief and teaching

Speaker 1 :so in that in that sense through jesus
 there was um that's kind of a historical momentthat's profound that's really powerful
 but do you also think that god makes himself seen inless obvious ways
 in our world today absolutely

Speaker 0 :absolutely i mean it's it's certainly
 been the outlook of umjews and christians throughout history
 that god is seen in the creation that we when we look at the creationwe see to some extent the wonder the
 majesty the might of the person or the entity but the person who created itand and that's a way in which scientists
 particularly uh have over over the ages andcertainly over most of the last five
 centuries since the scientific revolution scientists haveseen in a certain sense the hand of god
 in creation i mean this leads us perhaps to a differentdiscussion but i mean
 it's it's remarkable to me how influentialum christianity and religion in
 generally has been

Speaker 1 :in science yeah most of the scientists
 through history as if you described i mean god has been a verybig part of their life


Speaker 0 :and they were certainly up until the
 beginning of the 20th century that was the case

Speaker 1 :so maybe this is a good time to can you
 tell me what scientism is

Speaker 0 :yeah i mean the short answer is that's
 by scientism we me we mean the belief that science isall the real knowledge there is
 um and that's a shorthand there are lots of different facets of it and what whichone can explore and the book in which i
 explored it most most thoroughly was actuallyan earlier book called monopolizing
 knowledge and and the the purpose of that title is to is todraw
 attention to the fact that in our society as a wholein particular in the west today we
 we have grown so reliant on science that we that wetend to put aside other ways of getting
 to know things and so of course at mit we are focusedon science and we do
 focus on it very much but the truth is that there are many ways of getting toknow things
 in our world know things reliably in our worldand a lot of them are not science so
 scientism in my view is a terrible intellectual error it's to beit's the belief that somehow the methods
 of science as we've developed them with exyou know experiments and and in the end
 they it relies particularly upon reproducibility in theworld
 and on a kind of clarity that comes from measurementsand mathematics and related types of
 of skills those powerful though they are for finding out about the worldare not all the knowledge do not give us
 all the knowledge we we have and there's many other forms ofknowledge
 and the illustration that i usually use to to try to help people to think aboutthis is to say well look let's think
 about human history i mean to what extent canhuman history be discovered
 scientifically the answer is essentially it can'tbecause and the reason is because human
 history is not reproducible you can't do reproducible experiments or observationsand
 and go back and you know try it over again it'sit's a one-off thing you know the
 history is full of unique events and and so you you know you you youcan't hope to do history
 using the methods of science yeah i mean

Speaker 1 :in in some sense
 history is a story of miracles i mean they don't have to haveto do with god it's just uniqueness is


Speaker 0 :anyway unique events


Speaker 1 :these unique events and uh that science
 doesn't like that because it's uh unique events but they're verydefinition or not
 reproducible um can i ask sort of a tricky question i don't even know whatatheist or atheism is but is it possible
 for somebody to be an atheist and avoidum slipping into scientism oh yeah


Speaker 0 :absolutely
 i mean i mean there the these are two separate things okayi'm quite sure there are many people who
 don't believe in god and yet recognize that there are many differentways of we get
 knowledge you know some is history some is sociology economicspolitics um philosophy
 art history uh language literature et cetera et cetera there aremany people who recognize those
 disciplines as having their own approaches to epistemology and toget how we get knowledge and valuing
 them very highly i don't mean to say thateveryone you know who's an atheist
 automatically you know subscribes to scientific viewpoint that's not true butit's certainly the case that many of the
 arguments in fact most of the arguments of the aggressive atheists of thiscentury people are sometimes called new
 atheists although they're actually rather oldmost of their arguments are rather old
 you know are drawing heavily on scientism so whenthey say things like
 there's no evidence to support christianity okaywhat they are really focusing on is to
 say is saying that christianity isn't provedor
 the evidence for christianity is not science okay science doesn't prove itand and you you know if you read their
 books that's what you find they really meanis science doesn't lead you necessarily
 to believe in a creator god or into in any particular in umreligion i accept that that's not a
 problem to me because i don't think that science isall the knowledge there is and i think
 there are other important ways of getting to knowthings and one of them is historical for
 example and i mentioned earlier that i think i became persuaded and i wereand i still am persuaded that the
 historical evidence for the resurrection is veryis very persuasive again it's not proof
 or anything like that but it's but it's pretty good evidence okay

Speaker 1 :yeah i've um i talked to richard dawkins
 on this podcast and um and uh i saw you debate with seancarroll so
 i i i understand this world it makes it makes me very curiousbut maybe uh let me ask sort of another
 way my own kind of uh world view maybe youcan help
 as by way of therapy i understand um you know because you kind of saidthat there's other ways of knowing
 what about if we cut if if i kind of sit hereand am cognizant of the fact that i
 almost don't know anything so sort of i'm sit here almost paralyzedby the the mystery of it all
 and it's not even when you say there's other ways of knowingit it feels almost too confident to me
 because uh yeah when i when i listen to beautifulmusic or see art there's something there
 that's and that's uh that's beyond the reach ofscientism i would say so
 beyond the reach of uh the the tools of sciencebut i don't even feel like that could be
 an as an actual tool of knowing it um yeah i just don't even know whereto begin
 because it just feels like we know so little like uh if we look even a hundredyears from now
 when people look back to this time humans look back to this timethey'll probably laugh at how little we
 knew even a hundred years from now and if we look at a thousand years from nowhopefully we're still alive or some
 version of our ai versions of ourselvesyou know they they'll certainly laugh at
 the absurdity of our beliefs so what do you uhso you don't seem to be as paralyzed by
 how little we know you confidently push on forward but whatdo you make of that sense of
 uh of just not knowing of the mystery

Speaker 0 :we need to be modest
 or or humble if even about what we know i accept that and i icertainly think that's true not
 not simply because in the future we'll know more science andthere will be more powerful ways of
 finding out about things but simply because you know sometimeswe're not right
 we're wrong okay in what we think we knowum uh so that's crucial
 but it's also a very christian outlook that kind of humilityis what jesus taught so i so i don't
 know whether this was in the back of your mind when you were thinking aboutthis but it's often the case
 that um people of religious faith are are accused of being dogmatistsokay and there is a sense in which dogma
 teaching accepted teaching is is part ofreligions
 okay but i don't think that necessarily uh uh that leads oneto blind dogmatism and i don't i
 certainly don't think that faith we can talk about this later if you'dlike but i certainly don't
 think that faith means thinking you know something andnot listening to counter arguments for
 example um so i i think that's crucial yeah what is

Speaker 1 :uh
 what does faith mean to you what does it feel likewhat is it actually sort of how do you
 carry your faith in terms of the way you see the world

Speaker 0 :well i think
 faith is very often misunderstood in our society at the moment um becauseuh it's often portrayed as
 being nothing other than uh believing things you know ain't trueyou know um or or believing things that
 are are not proven okay um and um and this and faith does havea strand which is to do with you know
 basically believing in uh in concepts or umpropositions but actually the word faith
 is much broader than that faith also means umyou know trusting in something
 trusting in a person or trusting in a thinguh the reliability of some technology
 for example um that's equally part of the meaning ofthe word faith
 and and there's a third strand to the to the meaning of the word as welland that is loyalty so
 you know i have faith in my wife and and i try to actin faith towards her and that's a kind
 of loyalty and so those three strands are the arethe most important
 strands of the meaning of faith yes belief inin propositions that we might not have
 you know full proof about or maybe we have very little proofabout
 but it's also trust and and loyalty and actually in the in terms of thechristian faith
 christians are far more called to trust and loyalty than they are to belief inthings they don't
 you know don't have proof of okay um but but the critics of religion generallyum tend to emphasize the first one and
 say well you know you believe things for which you have no evidence okaythat's what that's what they think faith
 is well yeah there there is a sense in whicheverybody
 has to live their lives uh believing or or or making decisionsin situations when they don't
 have all the proof or evidence or knowledgethat enables you to make a completely
 um rational or well-informed or prudent decision weyou know we do this all the time you
 know my drive down here i nearly took a wrong turning and ithought which which way do i go do i
 keep going straight on and so my uh voice came out and i thinkgo straight okay
 so so you have to make decisions and sometimesyou know you don't have a navigation
 system telling you what to do you just have to make that decision with nowith insufficient evidence and you're
 doing it all the time as a human and that's part of beingsentient um
 and so that kind of um action and belief on the basis ofincomplete evidence
 is not something that i feel uncomfortable doing or ifeel that i feel on that somehow my
 christian commitments have forced me to do when iwouldn't have had to have done it
 otherwise i would have had to do it anywayum and and so you know there's a sense
 in which um i think it's important to see thebreadth of meaning of faith
 and and and to recognize then certainly in the case of christianityum it's trust and loyalty that the the
 key themes that we're called to and i mean another

Speaker 1 :interesting extension of that that you
 speak to it's kind of loyalty is referring to uha connection with something outside of
 yourself yeah um so i think you've spoken about likeexistentialism or even just atheism in
 general as um as leading naturally to an individualismas a focus on the on the self
 and uh ideas that maybe the christian faith can instill in you is umallowing you to sort of look outside of
 yourself so connection i mean loyalty fundamentally is aboutother beings
 and yeah other beings and i mean i think i don't know what it is in me but i'mvery much drawn to that idea
 and i think humans in general are drawn to that ideayou can you can make all kinds of
 evolutionary arguments all that kind of stuff but uhpeople always kind of tease me uh
 because i talk about love a lot and i mean there's a lot of uhnon-scientific things about love right
 like what what the heck is that thing why why dowe even need that thing
 it uh it seems to be an annoying burden that uh that we we get so much uhjoy in in life from a connection with
 other human beings deep uh lasting connections with human beingssame thing with loyalty
 why why do we get so much value and pleasureand strength and meaning from loyalty
 from a connection with somebody else going through uh thick and thin withsomebody else going through some hard
 times i mean some of the you know the closest friendsi i have is going through some
 some rough times together and that seems to make lifedeeply meaningful what is that


Speaker 0 :so yeah um i that's
 that resonates with me and i obviously i would i would affirm it umi i think just to just to correct
 the implication that you made i i don't think it's necessarilythe co the consequence of atheism uh
 that we that we lose track of those kinds ofthings i
 i mean i think that atheists can be loyal okay if you likeum the question more often
 comes up in the context of you know where does morality come fromand loyalty i think and duty are related
 to one another you know if we have loyalty to someone then we have a dutyto them
 okay as well and i think that in so far as we see ourselves as having some kindsany kinds of duties or moral compulsions
 with respect to our relationships to other peopleit's i think it's a question that always
 arises well where does these where do these come fromand there there are various approaches
 that people have towards deciding what makesethics or morality moral okay
 but i do think it's the case that um it's very hard to ground moralityum in in any kind of absolute way or
 a persuasive way um in mere human relationshipsand so it's certainly the case that in
 christianity um there is a sense in whichum morality and
 you know the morality of morals comes froma transcendent place from a transcendent
 deity and that we um that weground our the compelling
 force of of morals on god more than we do on individuals becauseafter all you know
 if it if you if you've got nothing but you know other people why should youyou know treat your neighbor well why
 shouldn't you defraud your neighbor if it's good foryou
 well you know you can construct all kinds of arguments and some of them areyou know obviously
 arguments that are commonplace in religion too you should do as you wouldbe done by and all this kind of thing
 right but none of that seems any any more than mere pragmatism to most peopleokay and so that's what that's one of
 the things if that nature amongst others you knowreally identified you know if god is
 dead if the idea of god is grounding our moral behavioris no longer viable in the west which
 nietzsche thought that it wasn't okay then what does ground it and he hadno good answer for it
 in fact he claimed there was no answer but then he couldn't live with thatand so he invented the idea of the
 ubermensch you know this the superior human beingokay
 and this was uh a different way of trying toground morality not a very successful
 one you know you could argue that is the forerunner of the sort of uhracism of hitler's regime and and
 and so forth um that you know we've in the west thankfully shied away fromuh in
 in the past uh uh half or three quarters of a centurybut um you know i think it is the case
 that uh christianity gives me a basis for mymoral beliefs that is more than mere


Speaker 1 :pragmatism yeah but there is uh
 so stepping outside of all of that there does seem to bea powerful stabilizing like we humans
 are able to hold ideas together like in a distributed way uhoutside of
 whether god exists or not or any that justour ability to kind of converse together
 towards a set of beliefs uh into sometimes into tribes it's kindof um
 i don't know if it's inherent to being human beings andi hope not because now if i look on
 twitter uh and there's uh there's the red team and the blue teamright
 it's almost like uh it's it's a charac it's some kind of tv show that we'reliving in
 uh that people get into these tribes and they hold a set of beliefsthat sometimes don't um i mean they
 they are beliefs for the sake of holding those beliefs and we get thisintimate connection between each other
 for sharing those beliefs and we spoke to the things about loyaltyand love and that's
 the thing that people feel inside the tribe andit seems very human that within that
 tribe those beliefs don't necessarily always have to be connected to anythingit's just the fact that uh you know i've
 uh did sports uh uh my whole life whenever you're on ateam
 the bond you get with other people on the team is incredibleand the actual sport is is often the
 silliest i mean i don't play ball sports anymorebut the ball when i played like soccer
 or tennis i mean all those sports are silly right you'replaying with a little ball
 but there's the bond you get is so deeply meaningful soi just it's interesting to me on on the
 sociological level that um it's it's possible to me whatever thebeliefs of religion
 is um whatever they're actually grounded inthey might be uh they might have a power


Speaker 0 :in themselves i think there is tribalism
 everywhere and i think tribalism in the u.s at themoment is rather difficult to bear
 from my point of view um and it's i think fed by the internet and socialmedia and so forth but
 but it's but historically tribalism is has been a trait and remains a trait inhumans
 the genius of christianity is that it supersedes tribalism i meanyes when the hebrews um
 thought about yahweh initially they thought about him as their tribaldeity just like the tribal deities round
 about about them and so but and and yetfrom you know early on in
 hebrew history the crucial thing that yahwehcame to mean or i would say revealed
 of himself to them was that he wasn't just a tribal deity he was thegod that created the whole thing and if
 he is the god of the whole thing then he's not just the godof the hebrews or in the case of
 you know americans god is not just the god of americans he's the god ofeverybody
 okay and that is a way in a way the most amazingtranscending of tribal loyalties
 and uh one of the crucial you know occasions in the new testamentum
 you know when the holy spirit comes at pentecostum you know the the the apostles and the
 and the disciples speak in other tongues and there are people from allall the countries you know round about
 hear them in their own languages and so you knowwhether
 whether you take that as factual or not that is the a statement of thetranscendent
 um aspects of christianity or the claimedtranscendent aspects of christianity
 that it transcends culture and that's certainly something which i

Speaker 1 :find appealing when i kind of uh
 touch on this topic in my own mind uh one of the hardest questions isas is why is there suffering in the
 world

Speaker 0 :do you have a good answer well i have i
 have some answers um but you're right that it is one ofthe toughest questions
 the problem of pain or the problem of suffering umor the problem of uh theodicy as
 as theologians call it is is is probably one of the toughest i think it'simportant to
 um say that there are certain types of answers to this questionbut there are aspects of this question
 to which there is no intellectual answer that is going tosatisfy
 um and and the the fact of the matter is you know when i'm speaking to anaudience
 uh let's say um at some kind of lecture i can be sure that there are peop thereare people
 in that audience who are either personally suffering they've gotillness they've got pains they're maybe
 they're facing death or someone in their family is in similarsorts of situations so
 suffering is a reality and and and there is nothing that ican say that is going to solve their
 feeling of agony and angst and andmaybe despair um in those types of
 situations there is really only one thing that ithink humans can do
 for one another in those kinds of situations and that is simply to bethere
 to be there alongside your friend or youror your colleague or or whoever you know
 family member or whoever it might be um and that's the only really sense inwhich we can give
 comfort if we try to give intellectual solutions to these problems were goingto be like
 like the comforters that were in the book of job in thein the bible um who who brought no
 comfort to job himself um with theirintellectual answers but if they had
 been there and some of them were there they sat alongsideum that is some level of comfort um and
 and after all that's the meaning of the word compassionit means to suffer alongside of somebody
 and i would say first off you know what does a christian sayabout suffering the the first thing a
 christian should say is compassion is all that really countsand what's more
 we say that god has acted in compassion towards usthat is to say he has suffered with us
 in the person of jesus christ and when we see the passion of jesuswe recognize that god takes
 suffering deadly seriously has taken it so seriouslythat he's been willing to come and be a
 part of his creation in the person of of jesus christ andsuffer
 death the most horrible death on the crossum and for our benefit so that's one
 side of of suffering but the question no thephilosophical question remains you know
 surely if god is good you know and god isomnipotent um benevolent um
 you know why doesn't he uh take away all the suffering why doesn't hecause miracles to occur that will take
 away all this suffering um i think there are some good answersto that question um
 in the in the following sense that um you know we live in a world wherethe consistency of the world is an
 absolutely crucial part of it you know the fact that our worldbehaves reproducibly in the main
 is absolutely essential for the integrityof our lives without it we wouldn't
 exist okay and so there is a sense in whichthe integrity of creation
 um calls for there being consistent behavior whichyou know these days we think of as being
 the laws of nature okay and so the consistent behavior ofnature
 is very very important it's what enables us to be what we areum and if you're calling upon god in
 in in in your critique of why isn't this benevolent creator you knowfixing things um one answer is
 he's fixed things in a certain sense to have an integrity in themand that integrity is the best thing
 it's the way we have our existence the way we live and move and have our beingand you know if you want something
 different you've got to show that there is a way in which you couldinvent a world that is better
 that it has the integrity that we need to exist okayand and and to be able to think and and
 and love and and be um butbut you were gonna do it better you know
 and the atheists think that maybe they have got a better idea but if theythought about it a bit more carefully
 they'd realize no one has put forward a better idea

Speaker 1 :okay so the so another way
 to say that uh i mean is that suffering is an integral part of thisof um of a consistent
 existence so so sort of uh in the philosophical in a philosophicalsense
 uh the full richness and the beauty of our experiencewould not be as beautiful would not be
 as rich if there was no suffering in the worldis that is that possible


Speaker 0 :well i think you said two different
 things that aren't exactly at least that aren't exactly the sameone is that suffering is an integral
 part of our experience you know thatmight be considered a challenge to
 certain types of christian theology or or even jewishtheology in other words
 christians talk about the fall and talk aboutuh adam and eve in the garden and and
 have that have a vision of there being some kind of persperception from
 or or perfection from which we have fallen and i think there is a perfectionfrom which we've fallen
 but i don't think that perfection is some kind of physical comperfection in other words i don't
 subscribe personally to the view that some some christians do that therewas some state
 prior to the fall in which death did not occuri don't think that that's consistent
 with science as we know it and i and i think that um deathfor example has been part of the
 biological world and and the universe as a wholeum from from billions of years ago so
 so just to be clear about that um you knowi i on the other hand i do so
 if that's the case then certainly in that sense at the very leastum suffering or at least death okay
 is part of the biological existence and that probably seems socompletely obvious
 to somebody who you know is okay with sciencewhether they you know whether they're a
 scientist or not well

Speaker 1 :so and i apologize if i'm interrupting
 but it's the obvious reality of of uh our life today but there's a lotof people i think it's currently in
 vogue i've talked to quite a few folks whokind of see as the goal
 of many of our pursuits as to extend life indefinitely a sort of uhyou know a dream for many people is to
 live forever uh but in the in this in thetechnological world
 in the engineering world in the scientific world i mean that's that'sthe big dream
 to me it feels like that's not a dream it's i certainlywould like to live forever
 uh like that that's the initial feeling the instinctual feelingbecause you know life is so amazing but
 then if you actually kind of like you'vepresented it if you actually
 uh lived that kind of life you would realize that that's actually a stepbackwards that's a step down from the
 experience of this life in my sense that death is an essentialpart of life
 about the essential part of this experience death of all things so thething the fact that things end somehow
 and the scarcity of things somehow createthe beauty of this experience that we
 have

Speaker 0 :yeah transhumanism doesn't look very
 attractive to me either but it also doesn't look very feasibleum
 but that's a whole big topic that i'm not exactly an expertbut i'll say but i but you know i've i'm
 of a certain age where my mortality is more pressing or moreobvious to me than it once was okay
 um and um and i don't dread that i don't see thatas in a certain sense even
 the enemy okay you're not afraid of

Speaker 1 :death well


Speaker 0 :i'm afraid of lots of things in a in a
 in a conceptual way but it doesn't keep meawake at night okay um
 i i'm i think like most people i'm more afraid of pain than i am of deathso i i don't want to put myself forward
 to some kind of hero that doesn't worry about these things that's not truebut i i do think and then and
 maybe this is part of my christian outlookum that there is life beyond the grave
 um but i don't think that that it's life inthis universe or in this um
 certainly not in this body and maybe not in a certain sense in this mind i meanyou know christian
 christian belief in the afterlife is is that we will be resurrected we willin a certain sense be with god i don't
 know what that means and i don't think anybody elsereally quite knows what that means but
 there are lots of ways that over history people artists and andand writers and so forth have pictured
 it um and these are all perhaps some of them helpful ways of thinkingabout it do you think it's possible to


Speaker 1 :know what happens after we die


Speaker 0 :um i i don't think we find out by
 near-death experiences or those kinds of things butbut i but i think that you know that
 we have sufficient i feel i have sufficientinformation if you like um in terms of
 god's revelation to be confident that that i willgo somewhere else okay but it won't be
 here and i to me theaspirations of transhumanism are
 horrific i mean i think it would be a nightmare not a dreama nightmare you know to be somehow
 downloaded into a computer and live one's life like thatbecause it it completely discounts the
 in integrity of our bodies as well as ourminds i mean
 we aren't just disembodied minds it would not be me that was in thecomputer
 it would be something else if if that kind of download were possible of courseit isn't possible and it's
 very long way from being possible but you know amazing things happen so weshouldn't


Speaker 1 :be too cert so this is this is a place
 that uh again maybe taking a slight step outside uh we'rephilosophizing a little bit uh let me
 ask you about uh human level or superhuman levelintelligence
 uh the uh artificial intelligence systemsdo you what do you make from um
 from almost a religious or a perspective that we've beentalking about of the special aspect of
 human nature of us creating intelligence systems thatexhibit some elements
 of that human nature is that something again like we were talking about withtranshumanism
 uh there's a feasibility question of how hard is it to actually build machines orhuman level intelligence
 or have something like consciousness or have all those kinds of human qualitiesand then there's the do we want to
 do that kind of thing so on both of those directions what do you think

Speaker 0 :well okay so you know since your podcast
 is called ai i don't want to offend too many of your listeners outthere that's but i
 but i i think one should be a little bit more modest about one's claims forai than have typically been the case
 yeah i think that actually a lot of people in aiare somewhat chastened and so there
 there are more modest claims than are common with the transhumanists andyes and and so forth
 um and you know i used to play chess when i was a kid i was pretty goodat it okay
 um he won competitions and so so on and so forthand i when i'm talking about when i was
 in high school i thought it was pretty unlikely that a computer would beable to become
 good at chess but i was dead wrong okay and so you knowum how did that make you feel by the way


Speaker 1 :when um do you blew big kids


Speaker 0 :i stopped playing chess seriously
 when i had when i encountered computers that could beat meokay i still play with my grandchildren
 a little bit but but um but yeah it it seemed like in acertain sense it became a solved
 problem uh when a.i was able to do it better than i couldso i think that there are ways in which
 today we've seen um computers do things whichhistorically were regarded as being
 very characteristic of human intelligenceand in that sense there there is some
 success to ai i also think that um you know there arecertain things which one might think of
 as being ai which are you know completely widespreadin our society i'm thinking about the
 internet search engines uh um and soforth which are enormously influential
 and obviously do things more powerfully thanany individual human or even any
 combination of humans could do much faster andand and uh accessing
 databases and so on and so forth all of this is uhoutstripped our human intelligence
 um i'm not sure the extent though to which that is reallyintelligence uh in the way that was
 traditionally meant but it's certainly amazinglyum facile and it
 it multiplies our ability to access human knowledge and and data and soforth so


Speaker 1 :is that something is that enter the
 realm of something we should be concerned aboutso in the realm of religion you talk
 about what is good what is evil what is right what is wrongyou have a set of morals set of beliefs
 and when you have an entity come into the picturethat that has quite a bit of power
 if we potentially look into the future and intelligence and capabilityum do you think there's something that
 religion can say about artificial intelligence or is thatsomething you we shouldn't worry about
 until it arrives you think just like with the chess program um you

Speaker 0 :know religious writers have thought
 about this for centuries uh you know there's been a long debateabout
 what is what it was historically called the plurality of worldsand it was actually more about whether
 there are places where other intelligent creatureslive than it was about us creating them
 but but i think it's largely the same

Speaker 1 :question it's almost like aliens
 yeah other intelligence so if there is

Speaker 0 :other intelligent life in the universe
 what is its relationship to god okay that isin a certain sense the puzzle that
 religious thinkers and writers have thought about for a long time andthere's
 a whole range of of different opinions about thati mean personally you know i think it's
 it's an interesting question but it's not a very pressing question at themoment
 um yeah and i think the same way about thethe question of what happens if we're
 able to build a sentient robot for examplei think it's an interesting question and
 we'll have to think about it when that happensbut i think we're still quite a ways
 away from that and so i i don't have a good answer um but ithink there's a literature that you one
 could tap um to think about okay if you want to

Speaker 1 :start early on the question yeah
 well let me ask you another impossible question you know from a religious orfrom a personal perspective
 what do you think is consciousness this this uhsubjective experience that we seem to be
 having does uh this does uhthe christian religion have something to
 say about consciousness does your own when you look in the mirror do you havea sense of what is consciousness


Speaker 0 :um i think the bible doesn't have much
 in the way of answers about that directly in the sense that you'reperhaps asking it which is more like
 i think you're asking for some kind of uh quasi scientific or maybe indeedscientific
 uh uh description that's not really looking for one yes

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :um i i think that i think that there
 it's an interesting question i think it's actually uma it's a jump too far i think we have we
 don't even know the answer to the question what is the mindlet alone consciousness so if you
 distinguish between those two things i think the question that's beingaddressed more directly
 scientifically as well as in other ways it is what is the mind and that iscertainly a very
 topical question even in places like mit which is nothistorically involved with philosophical
 questions you know that people doing neuroscience and so forth i thinkit's a very important question and i
 think that we're going to find that um we are not computersin other words i think the the
 commonplace theory of what mind is is is generally speakingby analogy that we are basically wet
 wet wear okay um that we that we're some computer-like entityand that that the analogy to digital
 computers is is is a pretty decent one i mean thatthat's of course a viewpoint
 which um you know which drives the aspirations of the transhumanists imean they they so much believe that our
 minds are nothing other than you know a certain sense somekind of implementation of software
 in biology that they say to themselves well of course we're going to be able todownload
 it into a into a digital computer i don't think that's truei think it's most likely that
 quantum mechanics is very important in the brainuh it seems most unlikely that it's not
 to me i know that that's contrary to the opinions of many people butbut that's my view and it's also a view
 for example of people like roger penrose and people like that who've writtenabout it rather extensively
 and if that's the case then really my mind is not reproducereducible to some kind of software which
 can be considered to be portable it is so connected to the hardwareof my body that the two are inseparable
 okay and so if that is in fact what we findum as i suspect will be the case then
 the aspirations of the transhumanists will bevery long in coming if at all
 um so i think that actually physics and chemistryum you know are in a certain are in a
 sense um uh involved with the brain and withinthe mind but not
 in a very simple way like you know like thecomputer analogy um in in a much more
 complicated way and i also think that umit's philosophically
 ignorant to speak as if um when and if the actions of the brainare
 are understood at the physical and chemical levelthat will me that the mind will vanish
 as a concept you know that we'll just say we're nothing butbrains okay of course it won't
 i mean it may well be that our mind is an emergentphenomenon that comes out of the physics
 and chemistry and biology okay but it's also something that wehave to
 encounter and take seriously and so um you know it's it's not the case thatit that the mind is
 reducible to nothing but physics and chemistry even if it'sembedded in
 you know continuously into physics and chemistry as i rather suspect it isum so i that that's my own view i mean
 another way of putting it is that the mind or the soulis not something added into humans
 as might have been the viewpoint um historically i do think there is youknow there is something added to humans
 but it's not it's not the mind it's the spirit andthat takes us beyond the physical
 context beyond this universe but i but i don't think that thatconsciousness the mind et cetera et
 cetera is that thing which is necessarily added

Speaker 1 :in explicit so i mean


Speaker 0 :i'm not a substance duelist in that
 sense okay if you want to put it philosophically

Speaker 1 :i mean um but you see you your senses um
 so the mind and the intelligence and consciousness can be these emergentthings
 do you have do you have a hope a sense that science couldhelp us get pretty far down the road of


Speaker 0 :understanding we will get much further
 than we have and we it'll be interesting um i mean right now our our methods ofdiagnosing the human brain
 are extremely primitive i mean the resolution that we haveyou know that comes out of uh out of nmr
 and and brain scans and so forth is miserable compared with what we needin order to understand the brain at the
 cellular level let alone at the at the atomic level um but uhyou know we're making progress it's
 relatively slow progress but it's progressand people are working on it and we're
 going to get better at it and we'll find out very interesting things as we doum the time resolution is also
 completely hopeless compared compare with what we need to understandthe thought you know
 so um so there's a long way to go and we will get better at itum but i'm but i'm not at all worried as
 some people are and some people speak as if there'sa good thing
 that somehow the concepts of humanity and the mind and religionand and consciousness are going to
 vanish because we're going to have you knowcomplete uh
 physical chemical description of the brain in the near futurethat we're not going to have that and
 secondly even if we had it the mind and all these other thingsaren't going to vanish because of it


Speaker 1 :well i i find kind of compelling that
 the notion that whoever created this universe and usuh did so to understand itself
 himself i mean that there's this um there's a powerful self reflectionnotion to this whole experiment that
 we're a part of

Speaker 0 :i certainly think that god takes delight
 in his creation and that it was created for that delightas much as it was
 um for any other reason and that you know that therefore are there'sreason to be
 hopeful and and awestruck by the creation whether it'son the very small or on the very large


Speaker 1 :i'm not sure if you're familiar there's
 something called the simulation hypothesisthat's been fun to talk about with the
 computer scientists and so on which is a kind of thought experiment that proposesthat you know the entirety of the world
 around us is a kind of a computer programthat's a simulation and then we're
 living inside it i think there's um i think from acertain perspective that could be
 consistent with a religious view of the worldi mean you could just use different
 terms uh basically uh what are your but it's a it's a itfeels like a more
 um modern updated version of that but what is what's your sense of this uhor the simulation hypothesis do you find
 it interesting useful to think about it do you find it ridiculousdid you find it fun what what are your


Speaker 0 :thoughts uh
 it's fun and it's been of course the subject of various movies yeah umthat that some of which are very well
 known um you know i don't think it makes sense tothink of it as a simulation hypothesis
 in the sense that we're really lying in uhbanks um of of uh
 on banks of beds having our energy drained away from usum and and the simulation is going on in
 our individual brains that that makes no sense to me atall i don't think that's what's
 meant by the simulation hypothesis as as you're using it nowbut i think that there is a um
 there is very little distinction between sayingthat a an intelligent creator
 has set up the universe according to his will and his planand set it in motion and is
 allowing it to run out maybe as christians sayhe's sustaining it actually
 um by his word of power it says in the bookof the letter to hebrews okay
 in in in this amazingly consistent and um integrated wayum i don't think there's very much
 difference between saying that and saying that it's assimilation okayi mean i think it's almost the same
 thing okay but i but i think from but i think it'simportant to recognize that
 the simulation in that concept the simulation and the creation or the orthe universe are the same thing
 okay in other words it's a simulation you know that is billions of light yearsacross
 okay yeah um i mean there's a sense in

Speaker 1 :which it helps
 one understand especially if you're not religiousthat there is something outside of the
 world that we live in that there's something bigger than theworld we live in um
 and that i mean it's just another perspective on uhthat humbles humbles you um so
 in that sense it's a powerful thought

Speaker 0 :experiment one shortcoming of that
 is is the following is of the of the analogy here's thisthat we think of a simulation as
 something take taking place in the universe you know when we it'sit's taking place in my computer okay
 i don't think that's the right analogy forum a christian view of creation okay
 i don't think it's taking place in some otheruniverse that god has made okay i think
 maybe it's taking place in the mind of godchristians might hypothesize also but i
 but i think that that that it's important to recognize thatchristian theology at a
 at any rate is that god is not one of the entities in the universe andand presumably therefore is very
 different from a simulation that we might run on a computer

Speaker 1 :let me ask you adam and eve even adam
 ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good andevil does this is this story meaningful
 to you what does the story mean to you

Speaker 0 :yeah it is meaningful to me um i i take
 the you know the writings of the bible veryseriously and i think that
 most christians regard them as having some kind of authoritativeum role in their in their in their faith
 um what do i get from it i mean i think the most important thing that christiansget from the story of adam and eve and
 eating the apple and so forth is that the relationshipbetween humans and god is broken
 has been broken by man's disobedience that's what the the story of adam andeve and the apple is all about
 and um that that broken relationship is for christians what jesus cameto redeem came to
 overcome that brokenness and restore that relationship with godto some extent at any rate on earth and
 and ultimately um you know in in the in eternity torestore it fully
 so that's really what christians mean and gain from the story of adam and eveof course lots of people
 ask the questions about how so how literally should we takethese stories of particularly the first
 few few chapters of genesis which is an important question butbut i mean but we tend to um get bogged
 down with it a bit too much i think we should take away the messageum
 and i think the the the uh what the what actually we would haveseen if we'd been there
 okay is something which is a matter of speculation and it's certainly notterribly important from the point of
 view of christian theology

Speaker 1 :but it seems like a very important
 moment as a man of faith do you umdo you do you wish that uh i think it
 was eve first

Speaker 0 :uh yeah we'll see do you wish
 by the way it was just a fruit it was a few you said it very carefully it wasthe
 fruit of the tree right

Speaker 1 :do you wish they wouldn't have eaten of
 the tree i mean this is back to our discussion of suffering wasthat like an essential thing that needed
 to happen

Speaker 0 :you're gonna have to read paradise last
 to get your answer to that

Speaker 1 :beautifully put okay well let me ask the
 the biggest question one that you also touch in your book but one that i askevery once in a while is what is the
 meaning of life

Speaker 0 :the meaning of my life is many different
 things okay but it but they are all kind ofcentered around relationships
 i mean for a christian one's relationship with god isa crucial part of the meaning of life
 but one's relationship with one's family wife'swife parents children grandchildren in
 my case and so forth those are cruciallyimportant
 these are all the places where people whether they're religious or notfind meaning
 but ultimately i think a person who has faith in a creatorwho we think has
 a an intention or many intentions but uh butbut but a will um
 in respect of the world as a whole that'sa crucial part of meaning and
 the idea that my life might have some small significance in the planof that creator is
 an amazingly powerful idea that give that brings meaning umi i tell a story in my book that um when
 i was a student before i became a christian i read aphilosophy book whose
 approximate title was um what you know what is the meaning of lifeand you know that book basically said
 there is no meaning to life you have to make up the meaning as you go alongand i think that's probably the the
 predominant secular view is these days that there is no realmeaning but you can make up a meaning
 and that will give you meaning into yourlife um
 i don't subscribe to that view anymore um i think there is more meaning thanthat um but i do think that those things
 which give meaning to our life are very important and we should emphasize them

Speaker 1 :and you you have said that as the part
 of the as the part of that meaning is the partof your faith uh
 love and loyalty are key parts so can you try to saywhat is uh love and loyalty


Speaker 0 :like what


Speaker 1 :what does it mean to you


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :what does it look like


Speaker 1 :if you were to give advice to uh to your
 children grandchildren of what to look forin and looking for loyalty and and love
 what would you try to say well i think

Speaker 0 :it's something like
 yielding your will or desire to another umit's valuing others more highly
 or at least as highly as yourself but that's just the start of it because truelove
 re you reach a point where you are you feel compelled by the otheruh and that i think to some
 people sounds very scary but actually it's terrifically liberating umand i think that love then brings you
 into service towards another and i'm you know reminded ofum the phrase from the anglican
 uh prayer book where it talks about um jesus whose service is perfect freedomin other words
 for us christians to serve god is what perfects our freedom and i thinkthere is
 an amazing love as um is in part capped captivitybut in a kind of paradoxical sense
 it's also an amazing freedom love is

Speaker 1 :freedom
 i don't think there's a better way to end it we started with fusion energyand ending on love and there's a huge
 honor to talk to you thank you so much for your time today thanks it was a
