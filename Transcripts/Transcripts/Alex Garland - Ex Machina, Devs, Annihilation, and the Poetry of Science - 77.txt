Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Alex garland writer and director of many imaginative and philosophical films fromthe dreamlike exploration of human
 self-destruction in the movie annihilation to the deep questions ofconsciousness and intelligence raised in
 the movie ex machina which to me is one of the greatest movies and artificialintelligence ever made I'm releasing
 this podcast to coincide with the release of his new series called devsthat will premiere this Thursday March
 5th on Hulu as part of FX on Hulu it explores many of the themes this verypodcast is about from quantum mechanics
 to artificial life to simulation to the modern nature of power in the tech worldI got a chance to watch a preview and
 loved it the acting is great Nick Offerman especially is incredible in itthe cinematography is beautiful and the
 philosophical and scientific ideas explored are profound and for me as anengineer and scientist were just fun to
 see brought to life for example if you watch the trailer for the seriescarefully you'll see there's a
 programmer with a Russian accent looking at a screen with Python like code on itthat appears to be using a library that
 interfaces with a quantum computer this attention and technical detail onseveral levels is impressive and one of
 the reasons I'm a big fan of how Alex weave science and philosophy together inhis work meeting Alex for me was
 unlikely but it was life changing in ways I may only be able to articulate ina few years
 just as meeting spot many of Boston Dynamics for the first time planted aseed of an idea in my mind
 so did meeting Alex garland he's humble curious intelligent and to me andinspiration plus he's just really a fun
 person to talk with about the biggest possible questions in our universe thisis the artificial intelligence podcast
 if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it five starson Apple podcast supported on patreon or

 and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation Ihope that works for you and doesn't hurt
 the listening experience this show is presented by cash app the number onefinance app in the App Store when you
 get it you just code Lex podcast cash app lets you send money to friends buyBitcoin and invest in the stock market
 with as little as one dollar since cash app allows you to buy Bitcoin let memention that cryptocurrency in the
 context of the history of money is fascinating I recommend a cent of moneyas a great book on this history debits
 and credits on Ledger's started thirty thousand years ago the US dollar wascreated about two hundred years ago a
 Bitcoin the first decentralized cryptocurrency was released just overten years ago so given that history
 cryptocurrency still very much in its early days of development but it stillis aiming to and just might
 redefine the nature of money so again if you get cash up from the AppStore Google Play and use collects
 podcast you'll get ten dollars in cash Apple also donate ten dollars the firstone of my favorite organizations that is
 helping advanced robotics and STEM education for young people around theworld and now here's my conversation
 with Alex garland you describe the world inside the shimmer in the movieannihilation as dreamlike I mean that
 it's internally consistent but detached from reality that leads me to ask do youthink a philosophical question I
 apologize do you think we might be living in adream or in a simulation like the kind
 that the shimmer creates we human beings here today yeah I want

Speaker 0 :to sort of separate that out into two
 things yes I think we're living in a dream of sorts no I don't think we'reliving in a simulation I think we're
 living on a planet with a very thin layer of atmosphere and the planet is ina very large space and the space is full
 of other planets and stars and quasars and stuff like that and I don't think Idon't think those physical objects I
 don't in the matter in that universe is simulated I think it's there we aredefinitely Soho problem is saying
 definitely but in my opinion just about that we I think it seems very like we'reliving in a dream state I'm pretty sure
 we are and I think that's just to do with the nature of how we experience theworld we experience in a subjective way
 and the the thing I've learned most as I've got older in some respects is isthe degree to which reality is
 counterintuitive and that the things that are presented to us as objectiveturn out not to be objective and quantum
 mechanics is full of that kind of thing but actually just day-to-day life isfull of that kind of thing as well so so
 my understanding of the way the way the brain works is you you get someinformation hit your optic nerve and
 then your brain makes its best guess about what it's seeing or what it'ssaying it's seeing it may or may not be
 an accurate best guess it might be an inaccurate best guess and that that gapthe best guess gap means that we are
 essentially living in a subjective state which means that we're in a dream stateso I I think you could enlarge on the
 dream state in all sorts of ways but so yes dream state no simulation would be

Speaker 1 :where I'd come down said going further
 deeper into that direction you've also described that world aspsychedelia so on that topic I'm curious
 about that world on the topic of psychedelic drugs do you see those kindsof chemicals that modify our
 option as a distortion of our perception reality or a window into another reality

Speaker 0 :no I think what I'd be saying is that we
 live in a distorted reality and then those kinds of drugs give us a differentkind of distorted active yeah exactly
 they just give an alternate Distortion and I think that what they really do isthey give they give a distorted
 perception which is a little bit more halide to daydreams or unconsciousinterests so if for some reason you're
 feeling unconsciously anxious at that moment and you take a psychedelic drugyou'll have a more pronounced unpleasant
 experience and if you're feeling very calm or or happy my have a good time butbut yeah so if I'm saying we're starting
 from a premise our starting point is or we were already in the slightlypsychedelic state you what those drugs
 do is help you go further down an avenue or it may be a slightly different Avenue

Speaker 1 :but that's what so in in a movie
 annihilation the the shimmer this alternate dreamlike state is created byI believe perhaps an alien entity of
 course everything is up to interpretation right but do you thinkthere's in our world in our universe do
 you think there's intelligent life out there and if so how different is it from

Speaker 0 :us humans well one of the things I was
 trying to do in annihilation was to to offer up a form of alien life that wasactually alien because it would often
 seem to me that in the way we would represent aliens in in books or cinemaor television or well you know any one
 of the sort of storytelling mediums is we would always give them veryhuman-like qualities so they wanted to
 teach us about galactic federations or they wanted to eat us or they wanted ourresources like our water or they want to
 enslave us or whatever it happens to be but all of these are incrediblyhuman-like motivations and I was
 interested in the idea of an alien that was not in any way like us itdidn't share it maybe it had a
 completely different clock speed maybe it's way so what we're talking aboutwe're looking at each other we're
 getting information like hits our optic nerve our brain makes the best guess ofwhat we're doing sometimes it's right
 something you know the thing we were talking about before what if this aliendoesn't have an optic nerve maybe its
 way of encountering the space it's in is wholly different maybe it has adifferent relationship with gravity the


Speaker 1 :basic laws of physics that operates
 under might be fundamentally different it could be a different timescale and so

Speaker 0 :on yeah or it could be the same laws it
 could be the same underlying laws of physics you know it's a machine createdit where it's it's a creature creating a
 quantum mechanical way it just ends up in a very very different place to theone we end up in so so part of the
 preoccupation with annihilation was to come up with an alien that was reallyalien and didn't give us and it didn't
 give us and we didn't give it any kind of easy connection between human and thealien because I think it was to do with
 the idea that you could have an alien that landed on this planet that wouldn'teven know we were here and we might only
 glancingly know it was here that just be this strange point where the Venndiagrams connected where we could sense


Speaker 1 :each other or something like that so in
 the movie first of all incredibly original view ofwhat an alien life would be and she said
 in that sense it's a huge success let's go inside your imagination did the alienthat alien entity know anything about
 humans when it landed No so the idea is you're both you're basically an alienlife is trying to reach out to anything
 that might be able to hear its mechanism of communication or was it simply was itjust basically they're biologists
 exploring different kinds of stuff they

Speaker 0 :compete you see but this is the
 interesting thing as as soon as you say they're biologists you've done the thingof attributing human type motivations to
 it I I was trying to free myself from anything yes like thatso all sorts of questions you might
 answer about this notion or alien I wouldn't be able to answer because Idon't know what it was or how it works
 you know yeah I had I gave it some I had some rough ideas like it had a very veryvery slow clock speed and I thought
 maybe the way it is interacting with this environment is a little bit likethe way an octopus will change its color
 forms around the space that it's in so it's sort of reacting to what it's in toan extent but the reason it's reacting
 in that way is indeterminate

Speaker 1 :but it's Sobers Clark speed was slower
 than our human life Clark speed are inter but it's faster than evolutionfirst Laura then our solution yeah give


Speaker 0 :him the four billion years it took us to
 get here then yes maybe it started eight

Speaker 1 :if you look at the human soul ization is
 a single organism yeah in that sense you know this evolution could be us you knowthe evolution of the living organisms on
 earth could be just a single organism and it's kind of that's its life is theevolution process that eventually will
 lead to probably the the heat death of the universe already something beforethat I mean that's that's just an
 incredible idea so you almost don't know you've created something that you don't

Speaker 0 :even know how it works like yeah because
 anytime I tried to look into how it might workI would then inevitably be attaching my
 kind of thought processes into it and I wanted to try and put a bubble around itoh so no this is this is alien in its
 most alien form I have no real point of

Speaker 1 :contacts so unfortunately I can't talk
 to Stanley Kubrick so I'm really fortunate to get a chance to talk to youon this particular notion I'd like to
 ask it a bunch of different ways and we'll explore in different ways but doyou ever consider human imagination your
 imagination as a window into a possible futureand that what you're doing you're
 putting that imagination on paper as a writer and then on screen as a directorand that plants the seeds in the minds
 of millions of future and current scientists and so your imagination youputting it down actually makes it as a
 reality so it's almost like a first step of the scientific method that youimagining what's possible in your new
 series with ex machina is actually inspiring you know thousands oftwelve-year-olds millions of scientists
 and actually creating the future of

Speaker 0 :you've imagined well all I could say is
 that from my point of view it's almost exactly the reverse because I I see thatpretty much everything I do is a
 reaction to what scientists are doing I am I'm an interested layperson and I Ifeel you know this individual I feel
 that the most interesting area that humans are involved in is science Ithink art is very very interesting but
 the most interesting is science and science is in a weird place becausemaybe around the time Newton was a alive
 if a very very interested lay person said to themselves I want to reallyunderstand what Newton is saying about
 the way the world works with a few years of dedicated thinking they would be ableto understand that the sort of
 principles he was laying out I don't think that's true anymore I think thatstopped being true now so I'm a pretty
 smart guy and if I said to myself I want to really really understand what iscurrently the state of quantum mechanics
 or string theory or or any of the sort of branching areas of it I wouldn't beable to I'd be intellectually incapable
 of doing it because because to work in those fields at the moment is a bit likebeing an athlete I suspect you need to
 start when you're 12 you know and if you if you start in your mid-20s starttrying to understand
 in your mid-twenties then you're just never gonna catch up that's the way itfeels to me so so what I do is I try to
 make myself open so the people that you're implying maybe I would influenceit to me it's exactly the other way
 around these people are strongly influencing meI'm thinking they're doing something
 fascinating I'm concentrating and working as hard as I can to try andunderstand the implications of what they
 say and in some ways often what I'm trying to do is disseminate their ideasinto a means by which it can enter a
 public conversation so so X Makana contains lots of name checks all sortsof existing thought experiments you know
 shadows on you know Plato's cave and Mary in the black white room and allsorts of different long-standing thought
 processes about sentience or consciousness or subjectivity or genderor whatever it happens to be and then
 and then I'm trying to marshal that into a narrative to say look this stuff isinteresting and it's also relevant and
 this is my best shot at it so so I'm the one being influenced in my construction

Speaker 1 :that that's fascinating of course you
 would say that because you're not even aware of your ownthat's probably what Kubrick will say
 too right is in describing why Hal 9000 is greater the way how 9000 is createdas you're just studying what's but the
 reality when it when the specifics of the knowledge passes through yourimagination I would argue that you're in
 incorrect in thinking that you're just disseminating knowledge that the thevery act of your imagination consuming
 that science it creates something that creates the next steppotentially creates the next step I
 certainly think that's true with 2001 a Space Odyssey I think at its best and if

Speaker 0 :it fails prove that that's true of that


Speaker 1 :it is best it plans something it's hard
 describe it it inspires the the next generation and it could be feeldependent so your new series is more a
 connection to physics quantum physics quantum quantum mechanics quantumcomputing and yet ex machina is more
 artificial intelligence I know more about AI my sense that AI ismuch much earlier in its in the depth of
 its understanding I would argue nobody understands anything to the depth thatphysicists do about physics in AI nobody
 understands AI that there is a lot of importance and role for imaginationwhich they think you know we're in that
 what were Freud imagine the subconscious we're in that stage of of AI wherethere's a lot of imagination you didn't


Speaker 0 :thinking outside the box yeah it's
 interesting the spread of discussions and the spread of my anxieties thatexists about AI fascinate me the way in
 which some people are some people seem terrified about it what whilst alsopursuing it and I've never shared that
 fear about AI personally but it but the the way in which it educates people andalso the people who it agitates I find I
 find kind of fascinating are you afraid

Speaker 1 :are you excited I use sad by the
 possibility let's take the existential risk of artificial intelligence by thepossibility an artificial intelligence
 system becomes our offspring and makes

Speaker 0 :us obsolete I mean it's a huge huge
 subject to talk about I suppose but but one of the things I think is that humansare actually very experienced at
 creating new life-forms because that's why you and I are both here and it's whyeveryone on the planet is here and so so
 something in the process of having a living thing that exists that didn'texist previously it's very much encoded
 into the structures of our life and the structures of our societies doesn't meanalways get it right but it does mean
 we've learned quite a lot about that we've learned quite a lot about what thedangers are of allowing things to be
 unchecked and it's why we then create systems of checks and balances in ourgovernment and and so on and so forth I
 mean it's not say the other thing is it seems like there's all sorts of thingsthat you could put into a machine that
 you would not be so with us we sort of roughly try to give some rules to liveby and some of us then live by those
 rules to some don't and with a machine it feels like you could enforce thosethings so so partly because of our
 previous experience and partly because the different nature of a machine I justdon't feel anxious about it I I'm more I
 just see all the good you know broadly speaking the good that can come from itbut that that's just my that's just
 where I am on that anxiety spectrum you

Speaker 1 :know it's kind of there's a sadness so
 we as humans give birth to other humans right petition in their generations andthere's often in the older generation a
 sadness about what the world has become now I mean that's kind of yeah there is

Speaker 0 :but there's a counterpoint as well which
 is the most parents would wish for a better life for their children so theremay be a regret about some things about
 the past but broadly speaking what people really want is that things willbe better for the future generations not
 worse and so a and then it's a question about what constitutes a futuregeneration a future generation could
 involve people it also could involve machines and it could involve a sort ofcross pollinated version of it too or
 any but but none of those things make me feel anxious and doesn't give you

Speaker 1 :anxiety it does excite you like anything


Speaker 0 :that does not anything that's new I I
 don't think for example I've got I my anxieties relate to things like socialmedia that so I've got plenty of
 anxieties about that which is also

Speaker 1 :driven by artificial intelligence in the
 sense that there's too much information to be able to do is that an algorithmhas to filter that information and
 present to you so ultimately the algorithm a simple oftentimes simplealgorithms can
 trolling the flow of information on social media so that's another it is

Speaker 0 :yeah his but but at least my sense of it
 I might be wrong but my sense of it is that the algorithms have an eitherconscious or unconscious bias which is
 created by the people who are making the algorithms and and sort of delineatingthe areas to which those algorithms are
 going to lean and so for example the kind of thing I'd be worried about isthat it hasn't been thought about enough
 how dangerous it is to allow algorithms to create echo chambers say but thatdoesn't seem to me to be about the AI or
 the algorithm it's it's the my IVA T of the people who are constructing thealgorithms to do that thing if you see


Speaker 1 :what I mean yes so a new series does
 then we could speak more broadly there's a let's talk about the peopleconstructing those algorithms which be
 our modern society Silicon Valley those algorithms happen to be a source of alot of income because of advertisements
 okay so let me ask sort of a question about those people are there currentconcerns and failures on social media
 they are naivety I can't pronounce that word well are they naive are they I use

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :that word carefully but evil and intent
 or misaligned and intent I think that's a do they mean well and just go have aunintended consequence or is there
 something dark in them that that results in them creating a company results inthat super competitive drive to be
 successful and those are the people that will end up controlling the algorithms

Speaker 0 :at a guess I'd say there are instances
 of all those things so so sometimes I think it's naivety sometimes I thinkit's extremely dark and sometimes I
 think people are are not being naive or dark and and then in those instances aresometimes generating things that are
 very benign and and other times generating things that despite theirbest intentions are not very benign it's
 something I think the reason why I don't get anxious about AI high in terms of orat least hey is that have I don't know a
 relationship with some sort of relationship with humans is that I thinkthat's the stuff we're quite well
 equipped to understand how to mitigate the problem is is is issues that relateactually to the power of humans or the
 wealth of humans and that's where that's where it's dangerous here and now so sowhat I see I'll tell you what I
 sometimes feel about Silicon Valley is that it's like Wall Street in the 80s itit's rabidly capitalistic absolutely
 rabidly capitalistic and it's rabidly greedy but whereas in the 80s the senseone had of Wall Street was that these
 people kind of knew they were sharks and in a way relished in being sharks anddressed in sharp suits and and and kind
 of lauded over other people and felt good about doing it Silicon Valley hasmanaged to hide its voracious Wall
 Street like capitalism behind hipster t-shirts and you know cool cafes in theplace where they set up their and and so
 that obfuscates what's really going on what's really going on is the absolutevoracious pursuit of money and power so
 so that that's where I get shaky for me

Speaker 1 :so that veneer and you explore that
 brilliantly that veneer of virtue that

Speaker 0 :Silicon Valley has which they believe


Speaker 1 :themselves I'm sure so okay I I hope to
 be one of those people and I believe that so as a maybe a devil's advocateterm poorly used in this case
 what if some of them really are trying to build a better world

Speaker 0 :I can't I'm sure I think some of them
 are I think I've spoken to once who I believe in their heart feel they're

Speaker 1 :building a better work are they not able


Speaker 0 :to no no no they may or may not be but
 it's just a zone with a lot of flying about and there's also anotherthing which is that this actually goes
 back to I always thought about some sports that later turned out to becorrupt in the way that the sport like
 who won the boxing match or how a football match got thrown or cricketmatch or whatever happened to me and I
 used to think well look if there's a lot of money and there really is a lot ofmoney people stand to make millions or
 even billions you will find a corruption that's gonna happen so so it's it's inthe nature of its of its voracious
 appetite that some people will be corrupt and some people will exploit andsome people will exploit whilst thinking
 they're doing something good but there are also people who I think are veryvery smart and very benign and actually
 very self-aware and so I'm not I'm not trying to I'm not trying to wipe out themotivations of this entire area but I do
 it there are people in that world who scare the hell out of me yeah sure yeah

Speaker 1 :I'm a little bit naive and that like I
 it I don't care at all about money and so I'm uh you you might be one of the

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :good guys yeah but so the thought is but
 I don't have money so my thought is if you give me a billion dollars I would itwould change nothing and I would spend
 it right away on on investing it right back and creating a good world but yourintuition is that billion there's
 something about that money that maybe slowly corrupt the people around youthere's somebody gets in that corrupts
 your souls of you the way you view the

Speaker 0 :world money does corrupt
 we know that but but there's a different sort of problem aside from just themoney corrupts you know thing that we're
 familiar with in throughout history and it's it's moreabout the sense of reinforcement an
 individual gets which is so it effectively works like the reason Iearned all this money and so much more
 money than anyone else is because I'm very gifted I'm actually a bit smarterthan they are or I'm a lot smarter than
 they are and I can see the future in the way they can't and maybe some of thosepeople are not particularly smart
 they're very lucky or they're very talented entrepreneurs and there's adifference between it so in other words
 the the the acquisition of the money and power can suddenly start to feel likeevidence of virtue yes and it's not
 evidence of virtue it might be evidence of completely different things as

Speaker 1 :brilliantly put yeah yeah yeah that's
 brilliant put like so I think one of the fundamental drivers of my currentmorality let me just represent nerds in
 general the of all kinds is of constant self-doubt and the signals you know I'mvery sensitive to signals from people
 that tell me I'm doing the wrong thing but when there's a huge inflow of moneyit's you're there you just put it
 brilliantly that that could become an overpowering signal that everything youdo is right and so your moral compass
 can just get thrown off yeah and it's

Speaker 0 :that that is not contained to Silicon
 Valley that's across the board in

Speaker 1 :general yeah like I said I'm from Soviet
 Union the current president is convinced I believe actually he is he wants to doreally good by the country and by the
 world but his moral clock may be our compass may be off because yeah I mean

Speaker 0 :it's the interesting thing about evil
 which is the I think most people who do spectacularly evil things thinkthemselves they're doing really good
 things that they're not they're thinking I am a sort of incarnation of Satanthey're thinking yeah I've seen a way to
 fix the world and everyone else is wrong

Speaker 1 :here I go in fact I uh I'm having a
 fascinating conversation with a historian of Stalin and he took power iswhat he actually
 got more power than almost any person in history and he wanted he didn't wantpower
 he just wanted he truly and this is what people don't realize he truly believedthat communism will make for a better
 world absolutely and he wanted power he wanted to destroy the competition tomake sure that we actually made
 communism work in the Soviet Union and that spread it across the world he was

Speaker 0 :trying to do good I think it's it's
 typically the case yeah that that's what people think they're doing and I thinkthat but you don't need to go to Stalin
 I mean Stalin sure I think Stalin but probably got pretty crazy but actuallythat's another part of it which is that
 the other thing that comes from being convinced of your own virtues that thenyou stop listening to the modifiers
 around you and that tends to drive people crazy it's it's other people thatkeep us sane and if you stop listening
 to them I think you go be mad so that

Speaker 1 :that also that's funny a disagreement
 keeps us saying to jump back for an entire generation of AI researchers 2001a Space Odyssey put an image the idea of
 human level superhuman level intelligence into their mind do you eversort of jumping back to ex machina and
 talk a little bit about that you ever consider the audience of people who youwho are build the system's the robot
 assisted scientists that build the systems based on the stories you createwhich I would argue I mean there's
 literally most of the top researchers about 40 50 years old and plus you knowthat's their favorite movie 2001 Space
 Odyssey and it really is in their work their idea of what ethics is of what isthe target the hope the dangers of AI is
 that movie yeah right do you ever consider the the impact on thoseresearchers when you create the the work


Speaker 0 :you do certainly not with Xbox in
 relation to 2001 because I'm not sure I mean I'd be pleased if there was but I'mnot sure in a way there isn't a
 fundamental discussion of issues to do with AI thatisn't already and better dealt with by
 2001 2001 does a very very good account of of the way in which an AI might thinkand also potential issues with the way
 the AI might think and also then a separate question about whether the AIis malevolent or benevolent and 2001
 doesn't really is it's a slightly odd thing to be making a film when you knowthere's a pre-existing film which is not
 a really super job but there's a

Speaker 1 :questions of consciousness embodiment
 and also the same kinds of questions could you because those are my twofavorite AI movies so can you compare
 how all 9000 and Ava how 9,000 from 2001 Space Odyssey na or from ex machina thein your view from a philosophical


Speaker 0 :perspective they've got different goals
 the to a eyes have completely different guy I think that's really the differenceso in some respects ex machina took as a
 premise how do you assess whether something else has consciousness so itwas a version of the Turing test except
 instead of having the machine hidden you you put the machine in plain sight inthe way that we are in plain sight of
 each other and say now assess the consciousness and a way it wasillustrating the the the way in which
 you'd assess the state of consciousness of a machine is this exactly the sameway we assess the state of consciousness
 of each other and in exactly the same way that in a funny way your sense of myconsciousness is is actually based
 primarily on your own consciousness that is also then true with the machine andand so it was actually about how much of
 the sense of consciousness is a projection rather than something thatconsciousness is actually containing and


Speaker 1 :Plato's cave I mean this view really
 explored you could argue that how sort of space odyssey explores idea of theTuring test for intelligence or not test
 there's no test but it's more focused on intelligence and ex machina kind of goesaround intelligence and says the
 consciousness of the human do you humanure by interactions moreinteresting more important more at least
 the focus of that particular particular

Speaker 0 :movie yeah it's about the interior state
 and and what constitutes the interior state and how do we know it's there andactually in that respect ex machina is
 as much about consciousness in general as it is to do specifically with machineconsciousness yes and it's also
 interesting you know thing you started asking about the dream state and I wassaying well I think we're all in a dream
 state because we're all in a subjective state yeah one of the things that Ibecame aware of with ex machina is that
 the way in which people reacted to the film was very based on what they tookinto the film so many people thought
 xmax magnet was a stet was the tale of a sort of evil robot who murders two menand escapes and she has no empathy for
 example because she's a machine whereas I felt no she was a consciousbeing with a consciousness different
 from mine but so what imprisoned and made a bunch of valuejudgments about how to get out of that
 box and there's a moment which is sort of slightly bugs me but nobody ever hasnoticed in its years after so I might as
 well say it now which is that after Ava has escaped she crosses a room and hasshe's crossing a room this is just
 before she leaves the building she looks over her shoulder and she smiles and Ithought after all the conversation about
 tests but in a way the best indication you could have of the interior state ofsomeone is if they are not being
 observed and they smile about something with they're smiling for themselvesand that to me was evidence of Ava's
 true sentience whatever that sentience was but those really interesting she we

Speaker 1 :don't get to observe a ver much or or
 something like a smile in any context except through interaction trying toconvince others that she's conscious


Speaker 0 :that's beautiful yeah exactly yeah but
 it was a small it in a funny way I think maybe peoplesaw it as an evil smile like ha yeah I
 fooled them but actually it was just a smile and I thought well in the endafter all the conversations about the
 test that was the answer to the test and then off she goes so if we align if we

Speaker 1 :just deliver it a little a little bit
 longer on hell and Ava do you think in terms of motivation what was how'smotivation is how good or evil is Ava
 good or evil

Speaker 0 :Ava's good in my opinion and how is
 neutral because I don't think how is presented as having a sophisticatedemotional life he has a set of paradigms
 which is that the mission needs to be completed I mean it's a version of the

Speaker 1 :paperclip yeah you know the idea there
 is just it's a super intelligent machine but it's just performing a particulartask
 yeah and in doing that tasks may destroy everybody on earth or may may achieveundesirable effects for us humans
 precisely

Speaker 0 :but what if okay at very end you said
 something like I'm afraid Dave but that that maybe he is on some levelexperiencing fear or it may be this is
 the terms in which it would be wise to stop someone from doing the thingthey're doing if you see what it means


Speaker 1 :yes absolutely so it actually has funny
 so that's such of this is such a small short exploration of consciousness thatI'm afraid
 and then you just with ex machina say okay we're going to magnify that partand then minimize the other part so
 that's that's a good way to sort of compare the two but if you could justuse your imagination and if Ava sort of
 I don't know ran the Quran easy was President of the United States also hassome power so what kind of world which
 you want to create if we here's you kind of say good and there is a sense thatshe has a really like I think there's a
 desire for better human to human interaction human robotinteraction in her but what kind of
 world do you think she would create with

Speaker 0 :that desire she also really it's a very
 interesting question that I'm gonna approach it slightly obliquelywhich is the if if a friend of yours got
 stabbed in a mugging and you then felt very angry at the person who'd done thestabbing but then you learned that it
 was a fifteen year old and the 15 year old both their parents redic todaycrystal meth and the kid had been
 addicted since he was 10 and he really never had any hope in the world and he'dbeen driven crazy by his upbringing and
 did the stabbing that would hugely modify and it would also make you worryabout that kid then becoming president
 of America right and Ava has had a very very distorted introduction into theworld so although there's nothing as it
 as it were organically within Ava that would lean her towards badness it's notthe robots or sentient robots are bad
 she did not her arrival into the world was being imprisoned by humans so I'mnot sure she'd be a great present the


Speaker 1 :trajectory through which she arrived at
 her moral views you have some dark

Speaker 0 :elements then but I like ever personally
 I like over and I think vote for her I'm having difficulty finding anyone to voteright now in my country or if I lived
 here in yours I am so that's a yes I guess because the

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :competition she could easily do a better
 job than any of the people I'd worked her over Boris Johnson so what is a good

Speaker 1 :test of consciousness just can we talk
 about consciousness a little bit more if something appears conscious is itconscious he mentioned the smile which
 is seems to be something done I mean that's a really good indication becauseit's
 a tree falling in the forest with nobody there to hear it but does the appearancefrom a robotics perspective of
 consciousness mean consciousness - you

Speaker 0 :know I I don't think you could say that
 fully because I think you could then easily have a thought experiment whichsaid we will create something which we
 know is not conscious but is going to give a very very good account of seemingconscious and so and and also it would
 be a particularly bad test where humans are involved because humans are so quickto project sentience into things that
 don't have sentience so someone could have their computer playing up and feelas if their computer is being malevolent
 to them when it clearly isn't and so so of all the things to judge consciousnessus humans are better
 we're empathy machines so that so the

Speaker 1 :flipside of that the argument there is
 because we just attribute consciousness to everything almost andanthropomorphize everything including
 Roombas the that maybe consciousness is not real that would just attributeconsciousness to each other so you have
 a sense that there is something really special going on in our mind that makesus unique and gives us the subjective
 experience there's something very

Speaker 0 :interesting going on in our minds I'm
 slightly worried about the word special because it it gets a bit it nudgestowards metaphysics and maybe even magic
 in I mean in some ways something magic like which I don't think is there at all

Speaker 1 :I mean if you think about there's an
 idea of called pants like ism that says consciousness is in everything whatever

Speaker 0 :but as brother yeah so the idea that
 that there is a thing that it would be like to be the son yeah no I don't buythat I think that consciousness is a
 thing did my sort of broad modification is that usually the more I find outabout things the more illusory our
 instinct is and is leading us into a different direction about what thatthing actually is that that happens it's
 in modern science that happens a hell of a lot whether it's to do with how evenhow big or small things are so so my
 sense is that consciousness is a thing but it isn't quite the thing or maybevery different from the thing that we
 instinctively think it is so it's there it's very interesting but we may be init's sort of quite fundamentally
 misunderstanding it for reasons that are based on intuition so I have to ask this

Speaker 1 :is this kind of an interesting question
 the ex machina for many people including myself is one of the greatest AI filmsever made


Speaker 0 :well it's number two for me thanks yeah
 number one I'd really have to was anyway

Speaker 1 :yeah whenever you grow up with something
 right you may grow up for something it's it's an it's in the wood but there's uhone of the things that people bring up
 and can't please everyone including myself this is what I first reacted tothe film is the idea of the lone genius
 this is the the criticism that people say sort of me as an AI researcher I'mtrying to create what what what nathan
 is trying to do so there's a brilliant series called Chernobyl yes this one

Speaker 0 :tested how so you spec talk I think I


Speaker 1 :mean as eyes are I mean they got so many
 things brilliant right but one of the things again the criticism there yeah

Speaker 0 :great nice place with lots of people who


Speaker 1 :need your one character that represents
 all nuclear scientists you wanna comb yet you know it's a composite characterthat presents all scientists is this
 what you were is this the way you were thinking about that or is it justsimplifies the storytelling how do you
 think about the lone genius well I'd say

Speaker 0 :this the series I'm doing at the moment
 is a critique in part of the lone genius conceptso yes I'm sort of oppositional and
 either agnostic or atheistic about that as a concept I mean they're not entirelyyou know where the lone lone is the
 right word broadly isolated but Newton clearlyexists in a sort of bubble of himself in
 some respect such as Shakespearean do

Speaker 1 :you think we would have an iPhone
 without Steve Jobs I mean how much Steve

Speaker 0 :Jobs clearly isn't alone genius because
 because there's too many other people in the sort of superstructure around himwho are absolutely fundamental to to


Speaker 1 :that journey are you saying Newton but
 that's a scientific so there's an engineering element to building Ava but

Speaker 0 :just to say what ex machina is is really
 it's a thought experiment I mean so it's a construction of putting four people ina house nothing about ex machina adds up
 in all sorts of ways in as much as that who built the machine parts did thepeople building the machine parts know
 what they were creating and how did they get there and it's a thought experimentyes so it doesn't it doesn't stand up to
 scrutiny of that sort I don't think it's

Speaker 1 :actually that interesting of a question
 but it's brought up so often that I had to ask it because that's exactly how Ifelt after what you know there's
 something about there was almost a defense I got wash your movie the firsttime in at least for the first little
 while in a defensive way like how dare this person try to step into the AIspace and try to beat Kubrick that's the
 way I was thinking like this because it comes off as a movie that really isgoing after the deep fundamental
 questions about AI so there's a there's a kind of a you know nerds do psyche isautomatically searching for the for the
 flaws and I I decide exactly the same I think in annihilation and the othermovie the I was be able to free myself
 from that much quicker that it's a it is a thought experiment there's you knowwho cares if there's batteries that
 don't run out right those kinds of questions that's the whole pointyeah but I bits nevertheless something I
 wanted to bring up it yeah it's a foot

Speaker 0 :it's the first thing to bring up for me
 the you you had all the lone genius thing for me it was actually peoplealways said ex machina makes this big
 leap in terms of where AI has got to and so what pay I would look like if it gotto that point there's another one which
 is just robotics I mean look at the way Ava walks around the rooms like forgetit building that it's that that's that's
 also got to be a very very long way often if you did get that would it lookanything like that it's a thought
 experiment

Speaker 1 :actually it's figure we I think the way
 as a ballerina Alicia vikander brilliant actress actor that movesaround that we're very far away from
 creating that but the way she moves around is exactly the definition ofperfection for roboticist it's like
 smooth and efficient so it is where we want to get where I believe like I thinkbecause so I hang out with a lot of like
 human robotics people they love elegant smooth motion like that that'stheir dream so the way she moved is
 actually what I believe that would dream for a robot to move it might not be thatuseful to move that sort of that way but
 that is important the definition of perfection in terms of movement drawinginspiration from real life so for devs
 for ex machina look at characters like Elon Musk what do you think about thevarious big technological efforts of
 Elon Musk and others like him and that he's involved with such as Tesla SpaceXyour link do you see any of any of that
 technology potentially defining the future worlds you create in your workso Tesla's automation SpaceX is space
 exploration your link is brain machine interface somehow merger of biological

Speaker 0 :and electric systems I'm in a way I'm
 influenced by that almost by definition because that's the world I live in andthis is the thing that's happening in
 that world and I also feel supportive of it so I think I think amongst variousthings Elon Musk has done I'm almost
 sure he's done a very very good thing with Tesla for all of us it's reallykicked all the other car manufacturers
 interfaces kicked the fossil fuel industry in the face and and they neededkicking in the face and he's done it so
 and and so that's the world he's part of creatingand I live in that world just bought a
 Tesla in fact and so does that play into whatever I then make in some ways itdoes partly because I try to be a writer
 who quite often filmmakers are in some ways fixated on the films they grew upwith and they sort of remake those films
 in some ways I've always tried to avoid that and so I looked at the real worldto get inspiration and as much as
 possible sort of by living I think and so so yeah I'm sure

Speaker 1 :which of the directions do you find most


Speaker 0 :exciting space trouble space travel so


Speaker 1 :you haven't really explored space travel
 in your work you've said you've said something like if you had unlimitedamount of money I think I now read at a
 ma that you would make like a multi-year series space Wars or something like thatso what what is it that excites you


Speaker 0 :about space exploration well because if
 we have any sort of long-term future it's that it just simply is that ifenergy and matter are linked up in the
 way we think they're linked up will run out if we don't move so we got to moveand but but also how can we not it's
 it's built into us to to do it or die trying I was on Easter Island a fewmonths ago which is as I'm sure you know
 in the middle of the Pacific and and difficult for people to have got to butthey got there and I did think a lot
 about the way those boats it must have set out into something like space it wasthe ocean and and how sort of
 fundamental that was to the way we are and it it's the one that most excites mebecause it's the one I want most to
 happen it's the thing it's the place where we could get to islike in a way I could live with us never
 really unlocking fully unlocking the nature of consciousness I like to knowI'm really curious but if we never leave
 the solar system and if we never get further out into this galaxy or maybeeven galaxies beyond our galaxy that
 that would that feel sad to me because because it's so limiting yeah there's

Speaker 1 :something hopeful and beautiful bar
 reaching out any kind of exploration reaching out across earth centuries agoand reaching out into space so what do
 you think about colonization of Mars so go to Mars does that excite you the ideaof a human being stepping foot on Mars


Speaker 0 :it does it absolutely does but in terms
 of what would really excite me it would be leaving this solar system in as muchas that I just think I think we already
 know quite a lot about Mars and but yes listen if it happened that would be Ihope I say in my lifetime I really hope
 I say in my lifetime I do it would be a wonderful thing without giving anything

Speaker 1 :away but the series begins with the use
 of quantum computers a new series does begins with the use of quantum computersto simulate basic living organisms or
 actually I don't know if it's quantum computers are used but basic livingorganisms simulated on a screen and yeah
 the cool kind of demo yeah that's right

Speaker 0 :they're using yes they are using a
 quantum computer to simulate a nematode

Speaker 1 :pill so returning to our discussion of
 simulation or thinking of the universe as a computer do you think the universeis deterministic is there a free will so


Speaker 0 :with the qualification of what do I know
 because I'm a layman right layperson but

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :with big imagination thanks with that
 qualification yeah I think the universe is deterministic and I see absolutely II cannot see how freewill fits into that
 so so yes deterministic no free will thatwould be my position and how does that


Speaker 1 :make you feel it partly makes me feel


Speaker 0 :that it's exactly in keeping
 with the way these things tend to work out which is that we have an incrediblystrong sense that we do have free will
 and just as we have an incredibly strong sense that time is a constant and turnsout probably not to be the case or
 definitely in the case of time but but but it's the the problem I always havewith free will is that it gets I can
 never seem to find the place where it is supposed to reside and yet you explore

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :just but a very very but we have
 something we can call free will but it's not the thing that we think it is but

Speaker 1 :free was so what we call free will is


Speaker 0 :just what they call it as the illusion
 of it and that's a subjective experience

Speaker 1 :of yeah the yeah yeah which is a useful


Speaker 0 :thing to have and it partly it partly
 comes down to although we live in a deterministic universe our brains arenot very well equipped to fully
 determine the deterministic universe so we're constantly surprised and feel likewe're making snap decision decisions
 based on imperfect information so that feels a lot like freewill it just isn'tit would be might that's why I guess so


Speaker 1 :in that sense your sort of sense is that
 you can unroll the universe forward or backward and you will see the same thingand you would I mean that notion yeah


Speaker 0 :sort of sort of but yeah sorry go ahead


Speaker 1 :I mean that notion is a bit
 uncomfortable to think about that it's good you can roll it back and andforward and well if you were able to do


Speaker 0 :it it would certainly have to be a
 quantum computer yeah something that worked in a quantum mechanical way inorder to understand a quantum mechanical
 system I I guess but but and so that

Speaker 1 :unrolling there may be a multiverse
 thing where there's a bunch of branching

Speaker 0 :what will exactly because it wouldn't
 follow that every time you roll it back or forward you'd get exactly the sameresult which is another thing that's


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :hard to rapamycin fact yeah but but but
 that yes it but essentially what you just describedthat the the yes forwards and yes
 backwards but you might get a slightly different result works very different

Speaker 1 :though or very different
 along the same lines well you've explored some really deep scientificideas in this new series and I mean it's
 just in general you're unafraid to to ground yourself and some of the mostamazing scientific ideas of our time
 what what are the things you've learned or ideas you find beautiful mysteriousabout quantum mechanics multiverse
 string theory quantum computing that

Speaker 0 :you've learned well I would have to say
 every single thing I've learned is beautiful and one of the motivators forme is that I think that people tend not
 to see scientific thinking as being essentially poetic and lyrical but but Ithink that is literally exactly what it
 is and I think the idea of entanglement or the idea of superpositions or thefact that you could even demonstrate a
 superposition or have a machine that relies on the existence of superpositions in order to function to me is
 is almost indescribable beautiful I it it it fills me with all it fills me withawe and also it's not it's not just a
 sort of grand massive or of but it's also delicate it's very very delicateand subtle and it has these beautiful
 sort of nuances in it and also these completely paradigm changing thoughtsand truths so so it's it's as good as it
 gets as far as I can tell so so so broadly everything that doesn't mean Ibelieve everything I read quantum
 physics because because obviously a lot of the interpretations are completely inconflict with each other and who knows
 whether string theory will turn out to be a good description or not but but thebeauty in it it seems undeniable and and
 I do wish people more readily understood how beautiful and poetic science

Speaker 1 :I would say Sciences poetry in terms of
 quantum computing being used to simulate things or just in general the idea ofsimulating simulating small parts of our
 world which actually current physicists are really excited about simulatingsmall quantum mechanical systems on
 quantum computers but scaling that up to something bigger like simulatinglife-forms how do you think what are the
 possible trajectories of that going wrong or going right if you if youunroll it into the future well if a bit


Speaker 0 :like Ava and her robotics you park the
 the sheer complexity of what you're trying to do the the issues are I thinkI think it will have a profound it if
 you were able to have a machine that was able to project forwards and backwardsaccurately it would in an empirical way
 show it would demonstrate that you don't have free will so the first thing thatwould happen is people would have to to
 really take on a very very different idea of what they were the thing thatthey truly truly believe they are they
 are not and so that that I suspect would be very very disturbing to a lot ofpeople do you think there has a positive


Speaker 1 :or negative effect on society the the
 realization that you are not you cannot control your actions essentially I guessis the way that could be interpreted


Speaker 0 :yeah although in some ways we
 instinctively understand that already because in the example I gave you of thekid in the stabbing we would all
 understand that that kid was not really fully in control of their actions soit's not an idea that's entirely alien
 to us but I don't know we understand

Speaker 1 :that I think there's a bunch of people
 who see the world that way but not everybody yes true

Speaker 0 :i but what this machine would do is is
 prove it any doubt because someone would say well I don't believe that's true andthen you'd predict well in 10 seconds
 you're going to do this and they'd say no no I'm not and then they'd do it andthen determine is
 would have played its part but I or something like that but actually theexact terms of that thought experiment
 probably wouldn't play out but but still broadly speaking you could predictsomething happening in another room sort
 of unseen I suppose the foreknowledge would not allow you to affect so whateffect would that have I think people
 would find it very disturbing but then after they'd got over their sense ofbeing disturbed which by the way I don't
 even think you need a machine to to take this idea on board but after they've gotover that they'd still understand that
 even though I have no free will and my actions are in effect alreadydetermined
 I still feel things I I still care about stuff I remember my daughter saying tome wish it she'd got hold of the idea
 that my view of the universe made it meaningless and she said well then it'smeaningless and I said well it I can
 prove it's not meaningless because you mean something to me and I meansomething to you so it's not completely
 meaningless because there is a bit of meaning contained within this space andso with a lack of free will space you
 could think well this robs me of everything I am and then you'd say wellno it doesn't because you still like
 eating cheeseburgers and you still like going to see the movies and so so howbig a difference does it really make but
 I think I think initially people would find it very disturbing I think I thinkthat what would come if you could really
 unlock with a determinism machine everything there'd be this wonderfulwisdom that would come from and I'd
 rather have that than not so that's a

Speaker 1 :really good example of a technology
 revealing to us human something fundamental about our world about oursociety so it's it's almost this
 creation is helping us understand ourselves in the the thing to be saidabout artificial intelligence so what do
 you think us creating something like Ava will help us understand about ourselveshow will that change society well I


Speaker 0 :would hope it would teach us some
 humility humans are very big on exceptionalismyou know America is is constantly
 proclaiming itself to be the greatest nation on earth which it may feel likethat if you're an American but it may
 not feel like that if you're from Finland because there's all sorts ofthings you dearly love about Finland and
 exceptionalism is usually probably not always if we both sat herewe could find a good example of
 something there isn't but as a rule of thumb and and and what it would do is itwould teach us some humility and about
 you know actually often that's what science does in a funny way it makes usmore and more interesting but it makes
 us a smaller and smaller part of the thing that's interesting and I don'tmind that humility at all I I don't
 think it's a bad thing our excesses don't tend to come fromhumility you know our excesses come from
 the opposite megalomania we tend to think of consciousness as having someform of exceptionalism
 attached to it I suspect if we ever unravel it it will turn out to be lessthan we thought in a way and perhaps


Speaker 1 :your very own Exceptionalist assertion
 earlier on in our conversation that consciousness is something belongs to ushumans or not humans belong organisms
 maybe you will one day find out that consciousness is in everything and thatwill yeah will humble you exact if that


Speaker 0 :was true it would certainly humble me
 although maybe almost maybe I don't know I don't know what effect that would haveaye-aye-aye sort of I mean my
 understanding of that principle is along the lines of say that that an electronhas a preferred state or it may or may
 not pass through a bed of glass it may reflect off or it may go through orsomething like that and and so that
 feels as if a choice has been made and but if if I'm going down the fullydeterministic routes I would say there's
 just an underlying determinism that has defined that that is defined thepreferred state or the reflection or non
 reflections but look yeah you're right if if if itturned out that there was a thing that
 it was like to be the Sun then I would I'd be amazed and humbled I'd be happyto be both it sounds pretty cool and


Speaker 1 :they'll be you'll say the same thing as
 you said to your daughter but it's nevertheless feels something like to beme and that that's pretty damn good yeah


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :so Kubrick created many masterpieces
 including The Shining dr. Strangelove Clockwork Orange but to me he will beremembered I think to many a hundred
 years from now for 2001 a Space Odyssey I would say that's his greatest film I

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :agree you are incredibly humble I've
 listened to a bunch of your interviews and I really appreciate that you'rehumble in your creative efforts in your
 work but if I were to force you a gunpoint keep it with God

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :you don't know that the mystery is to
 imagine 100 years out into the future what will Alex Carlin be remembered forfrom something you've created already or
 feel you may feel somewhere deep inside you may still create well ok well I'll

Speaker 0 :take I'll take the question in the
 spirit was asked but very generous

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :gunpoint yeah what what I what I try to
 do so therefore what I hope yeah if Iremembered what I might be remembered
 for is is as someone who who participates in a conversation and Ithink that often what happens is people
 don't participate in conversations they make proclamations they make statementsand people can either react against the
 statement or can fall in line behind it and I don't like that so I want to bepart of a conversation I take as a sort
 of basic principle I think I take lots of my cues from science but one of thebest ones it seems to me is that when a
 scientist has something proved wrong that they previously believed in theythen have to abandon that position so
 I'd like to be someone who is allied to that sort of thinking so part of anexchange
 part of an exchange of ideas and the exchange of ideas for me is somethinglike people in your world show me things
 about how the world work and then I say this is how I feel about what you'vetold me and then other people can react
 to that and it's it's not it's not to say this is how the world is it's justto say it is interesting to think about
 the world in this way and the

Speaker 1 :conversation is one of the things I'm
 really hopeful about in your works that the conversation you're having is withthe viewer in the sense that you you're
 bringing back you and several others but you very much so sort of intellectualdepth to cinema to now series sort of
 allowing film to be something that yeah sparks a conversation is a conversationlets people think allows them to think


Speaker 0 :but also crew it's very important for me
 that if that conversation is going to be a good conversation what that mustinvolve is that someone like you who
 understands AI and I imagine understands a lot about quantum mechanics if theythen watch the narrative feels yes this
 is a fair account so it is a worthy addition to the conversation that for meis hugely important I'm not interested
 in getting that stuff wrong I'm only interested in trying to get it right

Speaker 1 :Alex it was truly an honor to talk to
 you I really appreciate I really enjoy
