Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :Colin angle he's the CEO and co-founder
 of iRobot a robotics company that for 29

Speaker 1 :years has been creating robots that


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :operate successfully in the real world


Speaker 0 :not as a demo or on a scale of dozens


Speaker 1 :but on a scale of thousands and millions


Speaker 0 :as of this year


Speaker 1 :iRobot has sold more than 25 million


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :robots to consumers including the Roomba


Speaker 0 :vacuum cleaning robot the Bravo floor


Speaker 1 :mopping robot and soon the Terra
 lawn-mowing robot 29 million robots

Speaker 0 :successfully operating autonomously in
 real people's homes to me is an

Speaker 1 :incredible accomplishment of science
 engineering logistics and all kinds of general entrepreneurial innovation mostrobotics companies fail iRobot has
 survived and succeeded for 29 years

Speaker 0 :I spent all day at iRobot including a
 long tour and conversation with Colin

Speaker 1 :about the history of iRobot and then sat


Speaker 0 :down for this podcast conversation that
 would have been much longer if I didn't spend all day learning about and playingwith the various robots in the company's


Speaker 1 :history I'll release the video of the


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :tour separately Colin iRobot its


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :founding team its current team and its


Speaker 0 :mission has been and continues to be an


Speaker 1 :inspiration to me and thousands of
 engineers who are working hard to create

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :AI systems that help real people this is


Speaker 0 :the artificial intelligence podcast if


Speaker 1 :you enjoy it


Speaker 0 :subscribe on YouTube give it five stars
 and iTunes supported on patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lux

Speaker 1 :Friedman spelled Fri D ma a.m. and now
 here's my conversation with Colin angle

Speaker 0 :in his 1942 short story runaround from
 his iRobot collection as a Asimov proposed the Three Laws of Robotics inorder don't harm humans obey orders
 protect yourself so two questions first does the Roomba follow these three lawsand also more seriously what role do you
 hope to see robots take in modern society in the future world so the three

Speaker 1 :laws are very thought-provoking and
 require such a profound understanding of the world a robot lives in theramifications of its action and its own
 sense of self that it's not a relevant bar at least it won't be a relevant barfor decades to come and so if Roomba
 follows the three laws and I believe it does you know it is designed to helphumans not hurt them it's designed to be
 inherently safe and we design it to last a long time it's not through any AI orintent on the robots part it's because
 following the Three Laws is aligned with being a good robot product so um so Iguess it does but it does by not by


Speaker 0 :explicit design so then the bigger
 picture well what role do you hope to see robotics robots take in our what'scurrently mostly a world of humans we


Speaker 1 :need robots to help us continue to
 improve our standard of living we need robotsbecause the average age of humanity is
 increasing very quickly and simply the number of people young enough and spryenough to care for the elder growing
 demographic is inadequate and so what is the role of robots today the role is tomake our lives a little easier a little
 cleaner maybe a little healthier but in time robots are going to be thedifference between real gut wrenching
 declines in our ability to live independently and maintain our standardof living and a future that is the
 bright one where we have more control of our lives can spend more of our timefocused on activities we choose and so
 honored and excited to be playing a role

Speaker 0 :in that journey so you give me a tour it
 showed me some of the long histories now 29 years that I iRobot has been at itcreating some incredible robots who
 showed me Pat bot he showed me a bunch of other stuff that led up to Roombathat led to Brava and Terra so let's


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :skip that incredible history in the
 interest of time because we already talked about it I'll show thisincredible footage
 you mentioned elderly and robotics and society I think the home is afascinating place for robots to be so
 where do you see robots in the home currently I would say once againprobably most homes in the world don't
 have a robot so how do you see that changing woody things the big initialvalue add that robots can do so iRobot


Speaker 1 :has sort of over the years narrowed in
 on the home the consumers home as the place where we want to innovate anddeliver tools that
 we'll help a home be a more automatically maintained place ahealthier place a safer place and
 perhaps even a more efficient place to be and you know today we vacuum we mopsoon we'll be mowing your lawn but where
 things are going is when do we get to the point where the home not just therobots that live in your home but the
 home itself becomes part of a system that maintains itself and plays anactive role in caring for and helping
 the people who live in that home and I see everything that we're doing as stepsalong the path toward that future so


Speaker 0 :what are the what are the steps so if we
 can summarize some of the history of Roomba the you've mentioned and maybeyou can elaborate on it but you
 mentioned that the early days were really taking a robot from somethingthat works either in the lab or
 something that works in the field that helps soldiers do the difficult workthey do to actually be in the hands of
 consumers and tens of thousands hundreds of thousands robots that don't breakdown over how much people love them over
 months of very extensive use so that was the big first step and then the secondbig step was the ability to sense the
 environment to build a map to localize to be able to build a picture of thehome that the human can then attach
 labels to in terms of you know giving some semantic knowledge to the robotabout its environment okay so that's
 like a huge two big huge steps now maybe you can comment on them but also what isthe the the next step of of making a


Speaker 1 :robot part of the home sure so the goal
 is to make a home that that takes care of itselftakes care of the people in the home and
 gives a user and experience of just living their life in the home is somehowdoing the right thing
 lights when you leave cleaning up the environment and we went from robots thatwere great in the lab but we're both too
 expensive and not sufficiently capable to ever do an acceptable job of anythingother than being a toy or curio in your
 home to something that was both affordable and sufficiently effective todrive you know be a threshold and drive
 purchase intent now we've disrupted the entire vacuuming industry the number oneselling vacuums for example in the u.s.
 our room bows so not robot vacuums but vacuums and that's really crazy and

Speaker 0 :weird and yes we need to pause and
 that's incredible that's this is incredible that a robot is this is thenumber one selling thing that does
 something yep everything as essential as vacuuming so we're it's still kind of

Speaker 1 :fun to say but they just because this
 was a crazy idea that that just started you know in a room here we're like doyou think we can do this hey let's give
 it a try but but now the robots are starting to understand their environmentand if you think about the next step
 there's two dimensions I've been working so hard since the beginning of iRobot tomake robots are autonomous that you know
 they're smart enough and understand their task enough they they can just godo it without human involvement now what
 I'm really excited and working on is how do I make them less autonomousmeaning that the robot is supposed to be
 your partner not this automaton that just goes and does what a robot does andso that if you tell it hey I just
 dropped some flower by the fridge in the kitchen not can you deal with itwouldn't be awesome if the right thing
 just happened based on that utterance and to someextent that's less autonomous because
 it's actually listening to you understanding the context and intent ofthe sentence mapping it against its
 understanding of the home it lives in and knowing what to do and so that's anarea of research it's an area where
 we're starting to roll out features you can now tell your robot to clean up thekitchen and it knows what the kitchen is
 and can do that and that's sort of 1.0 of where we're goingthe other cool thing is that we're
 starting to know where stuff is and why is that important well robots aresupposed to have arms right data had an
 arm Rosie had an arm yeah Robbie the robot Hatter I mean brother you knowthey are physical things that move her
 around in an environment they're supposed to like do work yeah and if youthink about it if a robot doesn't know
 anything where anything is why should it have an arm but with this new dawn ofhome understanding that we're starting
 to go enjoy I know where the kitchen is I might in the future know where therefrigerators I might if I had an arm be
 able to find the hand I'll open it and even get myself a beer obviously that'sone of the true dreams of robotics as
 Deb robots bringing us a beer while we watch television but um you know I thinkthat that new category of tasks where
 physical manipulation robot arms is a just a potpourri of new opportunity and

Speaker 0 :excitement and you see humans as a
 crucial part of that so you kind of mentioned that and Ipersonally find that a really compelling
 idea I think

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :full autonomy can only take us so far
 especially in the home so you see humans is helping the robot understand or givedeeper meaning to the spatial


Speaker 1 :information right it's it's a
 partnership the robot is supposed to operate according to descriptors thatyou would use to describe your own home
 the robot is supposed to in lieu of better direction kind of go about itsroutine which ought to be basically
 right and lead to a home maintained in a way that it's learned you like but alsobe perpetually ready to take direction
 that would activate a different set of behaviors or actions to meet acurrent need to the extent it could
 actually perform that task so I gotta

Speaker 0 :ask you I think this is a fundamental
 and fascinating question because iRobot has been a successful company and a raresuccessful robotics company so Anki
 geebo Mayfield robotics with a robot curry sci-fi works rethink roboticsthese were robotics companies that were
 founded and run by brilliant people but all very unfortunately for at least forus roboticists that and all went out of
 business recently so why do you think they didn't last longer why do you thinkit is so hard to keep a robotics company
 alive

Speaker 1 :you know I say this only partially in
 jest that back in the day before Roomba you know I was a I was a high-techentrepreneur building robots but it
 wasn't until I became a vacuum cleaner salesman that we had any success sothough I mean the point is technology
 alone doesn't equal a successful business we need to go and find thecompelling need where the robot that
 we're creating can deliver clearly more value to the end user than it costs andit's this is not a marginal thing where
 you're looking at the skin like it's closed maybe we can hold our breath andmake it work it's clearly more value
 than the the cost of the robot to bring you know in the store and I think thatthe challenge has been finding those
 businesses where that's true in a sustainable fashionyou know the the when you get into
 entertainment style things you could be the cat's meow one year but 85% of toysregardless of their merit fail to make
 it to their second season it's just super hard to do so and so that that'sjust a tough business and there have
 been a lot of experimentation around what is the right type of socialcompanion what is the right robot in the
 home that is doing something other than tasks people do every week that they'drather not do and I'm not sure we've got
 it all figured out right and so that you get brilliant roboticist with superinteresting robots that ultimately don't
 quite have that magical user experience and thus the that value benefit equationremains ambiguous so you as somebody who


Speaker 0 :dreams of robots you know changing the
 world what's your estimate why how big is the space of applications that fitthe criteria that you just described
 where you can really demonstrate an obvious significant value over thealternative non robot bought a solution


Speaker 1 :well I think that we're just about none
 of the way to achieving the potential of robotics at home but we have to do it ina really eyes wide open
 honest fashion and so another way to put

Speaker 0 :that is the potentials infinite because
 we did take a few steps but you're saying those steps is just very initialsteps so the Rumba is a hugely
 successful product but you're saying that's just the very very just the very

Speaker 1 :very beginning it's the foot in the door
 and you know I think I was lucky that in the early days of robotics people wouldask me when are you gonna clean my floor
 it was something that I grew up saying I got all these really good ideas buteveryone seems to want their floor clean
 and so maybe we should do that Betty your good ideas earned the right to dothe next thing after that so the good


Speaker 0 :ideas have to match with the desire of
 the people and then the actual cost has to like the business the financialaspect has to all mash together yeah I


Speaker 1 :during our partnership back a number of
 years ago Johnson wax they would explain to me that they would go into homes andjust watch how people lived and try to
 figure out what were they doing that they really didn't really like to do butthey had to do it frequently enough that
 it was top of mind and and understood as a a burden hey let's make a product orcome up with a solution to make that
 pain point lesyk less challenging and sometimes we

Speaker 0 :do certain burdens so often as a society
 that we actually don't even realize like it's actually hard to see that thatburden is something that could be
 removed so it does require just going into the home and staring it wait how doI actually live life what are the pain


Speaker 1 :points yeah and it getting those
 insights is a lot harder than it would seem it should be in retrospect so how

Speaker 0 :hard on that point I mean one of the big
 challenges of robotics is driving the cost to something driving the cost downto something that consumers people would
 afford so people would be less likely to buy a Roomba for cost $500,000 rightwhich is probably sort of what a Roomba
 would costs several decades ago so how do you drivewhich I mention is very difficult how do
 you drive the cost of a Roomba or a robot down such that people wouldn't

Speaker 1 :want to buy it when I started building
 robots the cost of the robot had a lot to do with the amount of time it took tobuild it and so that we build our robots
 out of aluminum I would go spend my time in the machine shop on the millingmachine cutting out the the the parts
 and and so forth and then when we got into the toy industry I realized that ifwe were building at scale I could
 determine the cost of the rope instead of adding up all the hours to mill outthe parts but by weighing it and that's
 liberating you can say wow the world is has just changed as I think aboutconstruction in a different way the 3d
 CAD tools that are available to us today the operating at scale where I can dotooling and injection mold an
 arbitrarily complicated part and the cost is going to be basically the weightof the plastic in that part is
 incredibly exciting and liberating and opens up all sorts of opportunities andfor the sensing part of it
 where we are today is instead of trying to build skin which is like really hardfor a long time spent creating
 strategies and and ideas around how could we duplicate the skin on the humanbody because it's such an amazing sensor
 the instead of going down that path why don't we focus on vision and howmany of the problems that face a robot
 trying to do real work could be solved with a cheap camera and a big-asscomputer yeah and Moore's Law continues
 to work the cell phone industry the mobile industry is giving us better andbetter tools that can run on these
 embedded computers and I think we passed a an important moment maybe two yearsago where you could put machine vision
 capable processors on robots at consumer price points and I was waiting for ithapped to happen we avoided putting
 lasers on our robots to do navigation and instead spent years researching howto do vision based navigation because
 you could just see it where these technology trends were going and betweeninjection molded plastic and a camera
 with a computer capable of running machine learning and visual objectrecognition I could build an incredibly
 affordable incredibly capable robot and that's gonna be the future you know on

Speaker 0 :that point with a small tangent but I
 think an important one another industry in which I would say the only otherindustry in which they're true
 there is automation actually touching people's lives today is autonomous

Speaker 1 :vehicles mm-hmm what the vision each is


Speaker 0 :described of using computer vision and
 using cheap camera sensors that's there's a debate on that of lidar versuscomputer vision and sort of the Elon
 Musk famously said that lidar is a crutch that really in camera in the longterm camera only is the right solution
 which echoes some of the ideas you're expressing of coursein terms of its safety criticality is
 different but what do you think about that approach in the autonomous vehiclespace and in general do you see a
 connection between the incredible real-world challenges you have to solvein the home with Roomba and I saw a
 demonstration of some of them corner cases literally and autonomous vehicles

Speaker 1 :so there's absolutely a tremendous
 overlap between both the problems you know a robot vacuum and a Thomas vehicleare trying to solve and the tools and
 the types of sensors that are being applied in the pursuit of the solutionsin my world my environment is actually
 much harder than the environment and automobile travel we don't have roads wehave t-shirts we have steps we have a
 near infinite number of patterns and colors and surface textures on the floor

Speaker 0 :especially from a visual perspective
 yeah wait William looks it's really tough is an infinitely variable on the

Speaker 1 :other hand safety is way easier on the
 inside my robots they're not far you heavythey're not very fast if they bump into
 your foot you think it's funny and you know and autonomous vehicles kind ofhave the inverse problem and so that for
 me saying vision is the future I can say that without reservation forautonomous vehicles I think I believe
 what you know I'm saying about the future is ultimately going to be visionmaybe if we put a cheap lighter on there
 as a backup sensor it might not be the worst idea in the worldso the something so much hi thanks so


Speaker 0 :much higher that's you much more careful
 thinking through how far away that feature is right right and but I think

Speaker 1 :that the primary
 environmental understanding sensor is going to be a visual system visual

Speaker 0 :system so on that point well let me ask
 do you hope there's an AI robot robot in every home in the world

Speaker 1 :one day I expect there to be at least
 when I robot robot in every home you know we've we've sold 25 million robotsso we're in about 10 percent of US homes
 which is a great start but I think that when we think about the numbers ofthings that robots can do you know today
 I can vacuum your floor mop your floor cut your lawn or soon we'll be able tocut your lawn but there are more things
 that we could do in the home and I hope that we continue using the techniques Idescribed around exploiting computer
 vision and low cost manufacturing that we'll be able to create these solutionsat affordable price points so let me ask


Speaker 0 :on that point of a robot in every home
 that's my dream as well I'd love love to see that I you know I think thepossibilities there are indeed infinite
 positive possibilities but you know in our current culture no thanks to sciencefiction and so on there's a serious kind
 of hesitation anxiety concern about robots and also a concern about privacyand it's a fascinating question to me
 why that concern is amongst a certain group of people as as intense as it isso you have to think about it because
 it's a serious concern but I wonder how you address it best so from aperspective of a vision sensor so robots
 that move about the home and sense the world how do how do you alleviatepeople's privacy concerns how do you
 make sure that they can trust iRobot and the robots that they sharetheir home with I think that's a great


Speaker 1 :question
 and we've really leaned way forward on this because given our vision as to therole the company intends to play in the
 home really for us make-or-break is can ourapproach be trusted to protecting the
 data and the privacy of the people who have our robots and so we've gone outpublicly the privacy manifesto stating
 we'll never sell your data we've adopted GDP are not just where GDP are isrequired but globally we have ensured
 that any that images don't leave the robot so processing data from the visualsensors happens locally on the robot and
 only semantic knowledge of the home with the consumers consent is sent up we showyou what we know and are trying to go
 use data as an enabler for the performance of the robots with theinformed consent and understanding of
 the people who own those robots and you know we take it very seriously andultimately we think that by showing a
 customer that you know if you let us build a semantic map of your home andknow where the rooms are well then you
 can say clean the kitchen if you don't want to robot to do that don't make themap it'll do its best job cleaning your
 home but it won't be able to do that and if you ever want us to forget that weknow that it's your kitchen you can have
 confidence that we will do that for you so we're trying to go and be a sort of adata 2.0 perspective company where we
 treat the data that the robots average of the consumers home as if it were theconsumers data and that they have rights
 to it so we think by being the good guys on this front we can build the trust andthus be entrusted to enable robots to do
 more things that are thoughtful you

Speaker 0 :think people's worries will diminish
 over time as a society broadly speaking do you think you can win over trust notjust for the company but just the
 comfort of people have with AI in their home enriching their lives in some way I

Speaker 1 :think we're an interesting place today
 we're less about winning them over and more about finding a way to talk aboutprivacy in a way that more people can
 understand I would tell you that today when there's a privacy breach people getvery upset and then then go to the store
 and buy the cheapest thing paying no attention to whether or not the productsthat they're buying honor privacy
 standards or not in fact if I put on the package of myRoomba
 the privacy commitments that we have I would sell less than I would if I didnothing at all and that needs to change
 so it's it's not a question about earning trust I think that's necessaryby not sufficient we need to figure out
 how to have a comfortable set of what is the grade a meet standard applied toprivacy that customers can trust and
 understand and then use in the buying decisionsthat will reward companies for good
 behavior and that will ultimately be how this moves forward and maybe be part of

Speaker 0 :the conversation between regular people
 about what it means what privacy means if you have some standards you can sayyou're gonna start talking about who's
 following them who's not have more because most people are actually quiteclueless about all aspects of artificial
 intelligence of data collection so on it would be nice to change that for peopleto understand the good that AI can do
 and it's not some some system that's trying to steal all the most sensitivedata yep do you think do you dream of a
 Roomba with human level intelligence one day so you've mentioned a verysuccessful localization and mapping of
 the environment being able to do some basic communication to say go clean thekitchen do you see and you're maybe more
 bored moments once you get the beer to sit back with that beer and have a chaton a Friday night with the Roomba about
 how your day one

Speaker 1 :so true your latter question absolutely
 - your former question as to whether robot can have human level intelligencenot my lifetime you can have you I think
 you can have a great conversation a meaningful conversation with a robotwithout it having anything that
 resembles human level intelligence and I think that as long as you realize thatconversation is not about the robot and
 making the robot feel good that conversation is about you learninginteresting things that make you feel
 like the conversation that you had with a robot isa pretty awesome way of learning
 something and it could be about what kind of day your pet had it could beabout you know how can I make my home
 more energy-efficient it could be about you know if I'm thinking about climbingMount Everest what should I know and
 that's a very doable thing you know but if I think that that conversation gonnahave of the robot is I'm gonna be
 rewarded by making the robot happy but I couldn't have just put a button on therobot you could push in the robot would
 smile and that sort of thing so I think you need to think about the question inthe the right way and and robots can be
 awesomely effective at helping people feel less isolated learn more about thehome that they live in and fill some of
 those lonely gaps that we wish we were engaged learning cool stuff about our

Speaker 0 :world last question if you could hang
 out for a day with a robot from science fiction movies books and safely picksafely pick its brain for that day who


Speaker 1 :would you pick data data from Star Trek
 I think that a data is really smart data's been through a lot trying to goand save the galaxy and I'm really
 interested actually in emotion and robotics and I think he'd have a lot tosay about that because I believe
 actually that emotion play is an incredibly useful role in doingreasonable things in situations where I
 have imperfect understanding of what's going on in social situations on there's

Speaker 0 :been perfect information in social


Speaker 1 :situations also in competitive or
 dangerous situations that we have a motion for a reason andso that ultimately this my theory is
 that as robots get smart and smarter they're actually going to get moreemotional because you can't actually
 survive on pure logic because only a very tiny fraction of the situations youfind ourselves and can be resolved
 reasonably with logic and so I think data would have a lot to say about thatand so I could find out whether he
 agrees what if you could ask data one

Speaker 0 :question you would get a deep honest
 answer to what would you ask what's

Speaker 1 :Captain Picard really like okay I think


Speaker 0 :that's the perfect way to end the call
 and thank you so much for talking today
