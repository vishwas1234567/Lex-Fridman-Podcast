Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Paul Krugman Nobel Prize winner in economics professor CUNY and columnistat the New York Times his academic work
 centers around International Economics economic geography liquidity traps andcurrency crises but he also is an
 outspoken writer and commentator on the intersection of modern-day politics andeconomics which places him in the middle
 of the tense divisive modern-day political discourse if you have clickeddislike on this video and started
 writing a comment of derision before listening to the conversation I humblyask that you please unsubscribe from
 this channel and from this podcast not because you're conservative alibertarian the liberal or socialist and
 anarchist but because you're not open to new ideasat least in this case especially and
 it's most difficult from people with whom you'll largely disagree I do mybest to stay away from politics of the
 day because political discourse is filled with a degree of emotion and selfassured certainty that to me is not
 conducive to exploring questions that nobody knows the definitive right answerto the role of government the impact of
 automation the regulation of tech the medical system guns war trade foreignpolicy are not easy topics I have no
 clear answers despite the certainty of the so-calledexperts the pundits the trolls the media
 personalities and the conspiracy theorists please listenempathize and allow yourself to explore
 ideas with curiosity and without judgment and without derision I willspeak with many more economists and
 political thinkers trying to stay away from the political battles of the dayand instead look at the long arc of
 history and lessons it reveals in this I appreciate your patience and supportthis is the artificial intelligence

 and now here's my conversation with Paul

Speaker 0 :Krugman what does a perfect world a


Speaker 1 :utopia from an economics perspective


Speaker 0 :look like Wow I don't really I don't
 believe in perfection I mean somebody once once said that his ideal wasslightly imaginary Sweden it I mean I
 like an economy that has a a really high safety net for people a goodenvironmental regulation and you know
 not something that's not that's kind of like some of the better run countries inthe world but with fixing all of the the
 smaller things that are wrong with them

Speaker 1 :what about wealth distribution well


Speaker 0 :obviously you know total equality is is
 neither possible nor I think especially desirable but I think you want one wherebasically one where nobody is nobody's
 hurting and where everybody lives in the same material universe everybody isbasically living in the same society so
 no I think it's a bad thing to have people who are so wealthy that they'rereally not in the same world as the rest


Speaker 1 :of us what about competition you see the
 value of competition when what may be its limits Oh

Speaker 0 :competition is great when it can work I
 mean that there's a UH uh you know I remember I'm old enough to remember whenthere was only one phone company and
 there was really limited choice and I think the arrival of multiple multiplephone carriers and all that has actually
 he has been up been a really good thing and that's that's true across many areasbut not every industry is not every
 activity is suitable for competition so there are some things like health carewhere competition actually doesn't work
 and so it's it's it there's it's not one

Speaker 1 :size fits all it's interesting what is
 competition now work in in health care

Speaker 0 :oh there's a long list I mean there's a
 famous paper by Kenneth arrow for 1963 which still holds up very well where hekind of runs down the list of things you
 need for competition to work well basicallyboth sides to every transaction being
 well-informed having a you know the ability to make intelligent decisionsunderstanding what's going on and
 healthcare fails on every dimension you

Speaker 1 :know you did health care so not health


Speaker 0 :insurance health care well both health
 care and health insurance health insurance being part of it but no healthinsurance is is it is really the idea
 that there's effective competition between health insurers is wrong inhealth care I mean the idea that you can
 comparison shop for for major surgery is is just you know it it - when people saythings like that
 you you wonder are you living in the same world I'm living in you know that

Speaker 1 :the piece of well-informed that was
 always an interesting piece for me just observing as an outsider because so muchbeautiful such a beautiful world as
 possible and everybody's well informed a question for you is how hard is it to bewell-informed about anything whether
 it's health care or any kind of purchasing decisions or just life in

Speaker 0 :general in this world oh information you
 know in theory is hugely I mean there's more information at your fingertips thanever before in history
 the trouble is first of all that some of that information isn't true so it'sreally hard and and then some of it's
 just too hard to understand so if I'm if I'm buying a car I can actually probablydo a pretty good job of looking up you
 know going to consumer reports reviews you can get a pretty good idea of whatyou're getting when you get a car if I'm
 going in for surgery first of all it's you know you think fairly often thathappens when without your be able being
 able to plan it but also there's a reit you know medical school takes many manyyears and going on the internet for some
 advice is not usually a very good

Speaker 1 :substitute so speaking about news and
 not being able to trust certain sources of informationhow much disagreement is there about I
 mention utopia perfection in the beginning but how much disagreement isthere about what utopia looks like
 or as most of the disagreements simply

Speaker 0 :about the path to get there oh I think
 there's two levels of disagreement one maybe not utopia but justice you knowwhat is a just society and that's there
 are different views I mean I teach my students that there are you know toobroadly speaking two views of justice
 one focuses on on outcomes you ask your it's a just society is the one you wouldchoose if you were trying to what the
 one that you would choose to live in if you didn't know who you were going to bethat's kind of John Rawls and the other
 focuses on process that just society is one in which there is no no coercionexcept we're absolutely necessary and
 there's no there's no objective way to choose between those I'm pretty much aRawls in and I think many people are
 okay with it there's so there's a legitimate dispute about what what wemean by a just society anyway but then
 there's also a lot of disputes about what actually works there there's arange of legitimate dispute I mean any
 card-carrying economist will say that incentives matter but how much do theymatter how much does a higher tax rate
 actually deter people from working how much does a a stronger safety netactually lead people to to to get lazy I
 I have a pretty strong view that the evidence is points to a conclusions thatare considerably to the left of where
 most of our politicians are but but that there is legitimate room for

Speaker 1 :disagreement on those things so you've
 mentioned outcomes what are some metrics you think about the keep in mind likethe Gini coefficient but really anything
 that measures how good we're doing whatever we're trying to do well whatare the metrics to keep an eye on well


Speaker 0 :I'm actually I'm not a fan of the Gini
 coefficient not because what is the Gini

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :coefficient okay the Gini coefficient is
 a measure of inequality and it is commonlyused because it's a single number
 it usually tracks with other measures but the trouble is there's no sort ofnatural interpretation of it you ask me
 what you know what what does a society with the genie of 0.45 look like asopposed to society with a genie of 0.25
 and well I can kind of tell you you know when the 0.25 is Denmark and 0.45 isBrazil but it's that's a really there's
 no sort of easy way to do that mapping I mean I I look at things like what isfirst of all things like what is the
 income of the the the median family what is the income of the top 1% how manypeople are in poverty by various
 measures of poverty and then I think we want to look at questions like howhealthy are people how how is life
 expectancy doing and how satisfied are people with their lives because there isit's that they has sounds like a squishy
 number not so much happiness it turns out that life satisfaction is a bettermeasure than the happiness but life
 satisfaction that varies quite a lot and I think it I think it's meaningful ifnot too rigorous to say look according
 to that kind of according to polling people in Denmark are pretty satisfiedwith their lives and people in the
 United States not so much so and of

Speaker 1 :course Sweden wins every time


Speaker 0 :no actually Denmark wins these ends
 Denmark and Norway tend to win these days Sweden doesn't do badly but they'rethere they're it's none of these are
 perfect but look I think by and large I there's a bit of a pornography test ifyou how do you know a decent Society
 well you kind of know it when you see it

Speaker 1 :right where is America Stan and that we


Speaker 0 :are have a remark our society I mean
 it's there are a lot of virtues to America but there's alevel of harshness brutality an ability
 for somebody who just has bad luck to fall off the edge that is reallyshouldn't be happening in a country as
 rich as ours so we we we have somehow managed toproduce a crueler society than almost
 any other wealthy country for no good reason

Speaker 1 :what do you think is lacking in the
 safety net that the United States provides you said it's there's aharshness to it and what what are the
 benefits and maybe limits of a safety net in a country like ours well every

Speaker 0 :other advanced country has some
 universal guarantee of adequate health care the only in the United States it'sthe only place where citizens can
 actually fail to get basic health care because they can't afford it that'sthat's that's we it's not hard to do
 everybody else does but we don't we've gotten a little bit better at it than wewere but still that's that's a big deal
 we have remarkably weak support for for children we most countries havesubstantial safety you know parents of
 young children get much more support elsewhere they get often nothing in theUS we have limited care for people
 long-term care for for the elderly is a very hiddenness thing but I think thatthe really big issues are that we don't
 take care of children who make the mistake of having the wrong parents andwe don't take care of people who make
 the mistake of getting sick and those are those are things that a country arich country should be doing sorry for a


Speaker 1 :sort of a difficult question but what
 you just said kind of feels like the right thing to do in terms of justsociety but is it also good for the
 economic health of society to take care of to care the people who would theunfortunate members of society by and


Speaker 0 :large it
 looks like the doing the right thing in terms of justice is also the right thingin terms of economics if we're talking
 about a society that has extremely high tax rates that deter you know remove allincentives to provide a safety net that
 is so generous that why bother working or striving that could be a problem butthat's that I don't actually know any
 society that looks like that even even in European country with very generoussafety nets people work and and can
 innovate and do all of these things and there's a lot of evidence now thatlacking those basics is actually
 destructive that children who grow up without adequate health care withoutadequate nutrition are developmentally
 challenged they don't live up to their potential as adults so that the UnitedStates actually probably pays a price
 you know we're we're we're harsh we're cruel and we actually make ourselvespoor everybody as a society not just the
 individuals by being so harsh and cruel

Speaker 1 :okay so invisible hand Smith where does
 that fit in the power of just people acting selfishly and somehow everythingtaking care of itself
 to where you know the economy grows nobody there's no cruelty no injusticethat the markets themselves what is is
 their power to that idea where what are

Speaker 0 :its limits there's a lot of power to
 that I mean there there's a reason why I don't think sensible people want thegovernment running
 steel mills or they want the government to own the farms right the the marketsare a pretty effective way of getting
 incentives aligned of inducing people to do stuff that works and the invisiblehand is saying that you know people
 farmers aren't growing crops because they want to feed people they're growingcrops because they can make money but it
 actually turns out they're a pretty good way of getting of gettingand agricultural products grown so the
 invisible hand is important part but it's not there's nothing mystical aboutit it's a it's a mechanism it's a way to
 organize economic activity which works well given a bunch of preconditionswhich means that it actually works well
 for agriculture it works well for manufacturing works well for manyservices it doesn't work well for
 healthcare it doesn't work well for education so there are yeah we having asociety which is kind of 3/4 invisible
 hand and one-quarter visible hand seems to be something something on that orderseems to be the balance that works best
 it's just don't want to you don't want to romanticize or missed it you knowmake it something mystical out of it
 it's just this is is one way to organize stuff that happens to have what broadbut not universal application so then


Speaker 1 :forgive me for romanticizing it but it
 does seem pretty magical that you you know that I kind of have an intuitiveunderstanding of what happens when you
 have like 5 10 maybe even 100 people together the dynamics of that but thefact that these large society of people
 for the most part acting in a self-interested way and maybe electingrepresentatives for themselves that it
 all kind of seems to work he's pretty

Speaker 0 :magical the fact that there's uh you
 know that right now there's a wide assortment of fresh fruit and vegetablesin the you know in in at the in the
 local markets up and down the street you know who's who's planning that and theanswer is nobody that's the ol that's
 the invisible hand at work and that's great and and that's a lesson that'sthat Adam Smith figured out more than
 two hundred years ago and it's it continues to apply and the the but youknow even Adam Smith has a section his
 book about why it's important to regulate banks so the invisible hand has

Speaker 1 :its limits yeah and that example is
 actually a powerful one in terms of the supermarket and fruit that was myexperience coming from Russia from the
 Soviet Union is when I first entered a supermarketand just seeing the assortment of fruit
 bananas yeah I don't think I've seen bananas before first of all but just theselection of fresh fruit was just
 mind-blowing and it it beyond words and the fact that like like you said I don'tknow what made that happen well then


Speaker 0 :there is some magic to the market but
 the there's as showing my age but you know the old movie quote sometimes themagic works and sometimes it doesn't and
 you have to have some idea of when it doesn't so how do you get regulation

Speaker 1 :right
 how do what can government at its best to government strangely enough in thiscountry today seems to get a bad rap
 like everyone seems to everybody's

Speaker 0 :against the government yeah well a lot
 of money has been spent on making people hate the government but the reality isgovernment does some things pretty well
 I mean we government does health insurance pretty well so much so I meangiven our anti-government bias there it
 really is true that there are people out there saying don't let the governmentget its hands on Medicare so the
 government that got people actually love the government health insurance programfar more than they love private health
 insurance basic education it turns out that your local public high school isthe right place to have students trained
 and private for certainly for-profit education is is a by and large anightmare of ripoffs and and and grift
 and and people not getting what they they thought they were paying for itsjudgment case and it's funny there are
 things I mean everybody talks if there's the talks about the the DMV as being howdo you want the economy and actually my
 experience is that the DMV have always been positive maybe I'm just going tothe right DMVs but in fact a lot of
 government works pretty well so it you'd have to to some extent you can do thesethings on a priori grounds you can talk
 about the logic of why healthcare is not gonna be handled well by the market butpartly is just experience we tried where
 these some countries have tried nationalizing their steel industriesthat didn't go well but we've tried
 privatizing education and that didn't go well so you'd find out what works what

Speaker 1 :about this new world of tech how do you
 see what do you think works for tech is a more regulation or less regulation

Speaker 0 :there are some things that need more
 regulation and we're finding out that you know the world of social media is isone in which competitive forces aren't
 working very well and trusting the companies to regulate themselves isn'tworking very well but I'm on the whole a
 tech skeptic not in the sense that I think the tech doesn't work and itdoesn't do stuff but the idea that we're
 living through greater technological change than ever before is really anillusion we've ever since the beginning
 of the Industrial Revolution we've had a series of ethical shifts in the natureof work and in the kinds of jobs that
 are available and it's not at all clear that what we're at what's happening nowis any bigger or faster or harder to
 cope with than past shocks it is a

Speaker 1 :popular notion in today's sort of public
 discourse that automation is going to have a huge impact on job market nowyeah there is something something
 transformational happening now he talked about that maybe elaborate a little bitmore do you not see the software
 revolutions happening now with with machine learning availability of datathat kind of automation being able to
 sort of process clean fine patterns and data and you know you don't see thatdisrupting any one sector to a point
 where there's a huge loss of jobs there

Speaker 0 :may be some things I mean actually
 translators there's really reduced demand for translators because we'vetranslation ain't perfect but it ain't
 bad there are some kinds of things that are changed but it's not overallproductivity growth has actually been
 slowed in recent years now it's been much slower than in some past periods sothe idea that automation is taking away
 all the jobs the counterpart would be that we would be able to you knowproduce stuff with many fewer workers
 than before and that's not happening there are a few isolated you knowsectors there are some kinds of jobs
 that that are going with but that keeps on happening I mean they New York Cityused to have thousands and thousands of
 longshoremen taking stuff off off ships and tow putting them on ships they'realmost all gone now now you have these
 the giant cranes taking containers on and off ships in Elizabeth New Jerseythat's not robots it's doesn't doesn't
 sound high-tech but it actually pretty much destroyed that occupation well youknow that was it wasn't fun for the
 longshoremen to say the least and but it it's not we coped we moved on and thatthat sort of thing happens all the time
 you mean farmers we we used to be a nation which was mostly farmers thereare now very few farmers left the end
 the reason is not that we've stopped eating it's that farming has become soefficient that we don't need a lot of
 farmers and cope with that too so the the idea that there's somethingqualitatively different about what's
 happening now so far isn't true you see

Speaker 1 :yeah your intuition is there is going to
 be a loss of jobs but it's just the thing that just continues though youknow there's nothing qualitatively
 different about this moment some jobs

Speaker 0 :will be lost others will be created as
 has always been the case so far maybe there's a singularity maybethere's a moment when when the machines
 get smarter than we are and sky tech kills us all or something right but thebut that's not visible in anything we're
 seeing now

Speaker 1 :you mentioned the metric of productivity
 could you explain that a little bit because it's a really interesting oneI've heard you mentioned that before
 the in connection with with automation so what what is that metric and if thereis something qualitatively different
 what should we see in that metric well

Speaker 0 :okay productivity first of all
 production we do have a measure of the total the economy's total productionreal GDP which is it's not that it's a
 little bit of a construct because it's quite literally it's adding apples andoranges so we have to add together
 various things which we basically do by using market prices but we try to adjustfor inflation but it's kind of it's a
 reasonable measure of how much the economy is producing and goods in sorry

Speaker 1 :to interrupt is a goods and services and


Speaker 0 :services it's everything okay
 productivity is you divide that total output by the number of hours workedso we're basically asking how much how
 much stuff does the average worker produce an hour of work and if you'reseeing really rapid technological
 progress then you would expect to see productivity rising at a rapid clipwhich we did for in the generation after
 World War 2 productivity rose a 2% a year on a sustained basis then itdropped down for a while then there was
 a kind of a decade of fairly rapid growth from the mid 90s to the mid 2000sand then it's it dropped off again and
 it's not it's not impressive right now so you're just not seeing an ethicalshift in in in the economy so let me


Speaker 1 :then ask you about the psychology of
 blaming automation a few months ago you wrote in The New York Times quote theother day I found myself as I often do
 at a conference discussing lagging wages and soaring inequality there was a lotof interesting discussion but one thing
 that struck me was how many of the participants just assumed that robotsare a big part of the problem that
 machines are taken away the good jobs or even jobs in general for the most partthis wasn't even a presented as a
 hypothesis just as part of what everyone

Speaker 0 :knows yeah so why is maybe can you


Speaker 1 :psychoanalyze
 is our the puppet the public intellectuals or economists or usactually the general public yeah why
 this is happening why this assumption is just infiltrated public discourse

Speaker 0 :there's a couple of things one is that
 the particular technologies that are advancing now are ones that are a lotmore visible to the chattering class the
 you know if when you had a point when containerization did away with the jobsof longshoreman well not a whole lot of
 college professors are close friends with longshoremen right and so so we seethis one then there is a second thing
 which is you know we just went through its severe financial crisis and a periodof very high unemployment has finally
 come down the there's really no question that that high unemployment was aboutmacroeconomics it was about a failure of
 demand but macroeconomics is really not intuitive I mean people just have a hardtime wrapping their minds run it and
 among other things people have a hard time believing that something as trivialas well people just aren't spending
 enough can lead to the kind of mass misery that we saw in the 1930s or thatnot quite so severe but still serious
 misery that we saw after 2008 and there's always a tendency to say it mustbe something big it must be
 technological change that means we don't need workers anymore that was a lot ofthat in the 30s and that same thing
 happened after 2008 the assumption that it has to be something some deep causenot something as trivial as a failure of
 investor confidence and inadequate monetary and fiscal response and thelast thing that wages did a lot of
 what's happened on wages is at some level political if the collapse of theunion movement it's the it's policies
 that have squeezed workers bargaining power and for kind of obvious reasonsthere are a lot of influential people
 who don't want to hear that story they wanted to be an inevitable force ofnature technology is made it impossible
 to have people earn middle-class wage and they so that they don't they don'tlike they they don't like the story that
 says actually no it's kind of the political decisions that we made thathave caused this this income stagnation
 and so there are a receptive audience for technological determinism so what

Speaker 1 :comes first in your view the economy or
 politics in terms of what has impact on the other

Speaker 0 :oh they looked at it everything
 interacts she has some one of the rules of that I was taught in economicseverything everything affects everything
 else in at least two ways but the the I mean clearly the economy drives a lot ofpolitical stuff but also clearly
 politics has a huge impact on on on the economy there we we look at the declineof unions in America and said well you
 know it's the world has changed and unions don't have a role but you knowtwo-thirds of workers in Denmark are
 unionized and Denmark face has the same technology and faces the same globaleconomy that we do is just a difference
 in political choices that leads to that difference so I actually teach a coursehere at CUNY on called economics of the
 welfare state which is about things like health care and retirement and to someextent wage policy and so on and the
 message I keep on trying to drive home is that look in all advanced countriesthey've got roughly equal competence we
 all have the same technology but we make very different choices not that Americaalways makes the wrong choices we do
 some things pretty well our retirement system is is one of the better ones butbut the point is that the there's a huge
 amount of political choice involved in the in the shape of the economy what is

Speaker 1 :what is a welfare state well in welfare


Speaker 0 :state is the old term that but it
 basically first all the programs that are there to mitigate if you like thethe risks and in justices of the market
 economies so in the US welfare state is Social Security Medicare Medicaidminimum wages food stamps when you say


Speaker 1 :welfare state my
 first sir feeling is a negative one well I know I like all I probably generallyat least theoretically like all the
 welfare programs

Speaker 0 :well that's it's been demonized and to
 some extent I'm being a little doing a little bit of thumbing my nose at all ofthat by just using the term welfare
 state although it's not I see ya there I got you but everybody every advancedcountry actually has a lot of of a
 welfare state than the US I mean we that's fundamental part of the fabric ofour society the Social Security Medicare
 Medicaid are just things we take for granted as part of the scene and so ifyou you know that there there's a lot of
 there's people on the right wing who are say oh it's it's it's all socialism andwell I guess mean what you want them to
 mean and we just just today I I told my class about the the record that RonaldReagan made in 1961 warning that
 Medicare would destroy American freedom and but sort of didn't happen on the

Speaker 1 :topic of welfare state what are your
 thoughts on universal basic income and a sort of a a gin not a generic but auniversal safety net of this kind


Speaker 0 :there's always a trade-off when we talk
 about social safety net programs there's always a trade-off between universalitywhich is clean but means that you're
 giving a lot of money to people who don't necessarily need it and some kindof targeting which makes it easier to
 get to deal with the crucial problems with limited resources but but both hasincentive problems and kind of political
 and I would say even psychological issues so the great thing about SocialSecurity and Medicare is no questions
 asked you know no you don't have to prove that you need them i it'scomes you know I didn't I'm on medic
 here I allegedly I mean it's it's run through my my my New York Times healthinsurance but you know I didn't have to
 file an application with the Medicare office to prove that I needed it justhappened when I turned 65 there's that's
 good for dignity and it's also good for the political support because everybodygets Medicare on the other hand if you
 and and we can do that with health care to give everybody a guarantee of anincome that's enough to live on
 comfortably but that's a lot of money

Speaker 1 :what about enough income to carry you
 over to difficult periods like if you lose a job that kind of well we have

Speaker 0 :unemployment insurance and I think our
 unemployment insurance is too short lived and too stingy it would be betterto have a more comprehensive
 unemployment insurance benefit but the trouble with with something likeuniversal basic income is that either
 the bar is set too low so it's really not something you can live on or it's anenormous ly expensive program and so at
 this point I think that we can do far better by building on the kinds ofsafety net programs we have I mean food
 stamps Earned Income Tax Credit we should have a lot more family supportpolicies those things can deal with can
 do a lot more to really diminish the amount of misery in this country ubi issomething that is being I mean it it
 goes kind of hand-in-hand with with this belief that the robots are going to takeall of our jobs and if that was really
 happening then I might reconsider my views on UPI but I don't see thathappening


Speaker 1 :so are you happy with this course as
 going on now in terms of politics so you mentioned a few political candidates isis the kind of thing going on and on
 both on Twitter and debates in the media through the written words is a spokenword how do you assess the public
 discourse now in terms of politics we're

Speaker 0 :in a fragmented world so more so more so
 than ever before so at this point the public discourse that you see if ifyou're if Fox News is your principal
 news source is is very different from the one you get if you read the New YorkTimes on the whole my sense is that
 mainstream political reporting policy reporting is a not too great but bebetter than it's ever been because of
 what when I first got into the you know the pundit business it was just awfullots of things just never got covered
 and if things did get covered it was always both sides I mean it's the linethat comes back from me writing during
 the 2000 campaign was that it if one of the candidates said that the earth wasflat the the headline would de use
 differ on shape of planet I mean it's a and and it's that's less true there'sstill a fair bit of that out there but
 it's less true than there used to be and there are more people reporting writingon on policy issues who actually
 understand them than ever before so though that's good but I still I havehow much the typical voter is actually
 informed unclear I mean they the the Democratic debates I think we I'm hopingthat we finally get down to having a not
 having 27 people on the stage or whatever it is they have but but yeahthey're reasonably substantive certainly
 better than before and while there's a lot of still you know theater criticisminstead of actual analysis and the
 reporting it's it's not as totally dominant as in the past it can ask maybe

Speaker 1 :a dumb question but from an open-minded
 perspective when you know people on the left and peopleon the right
 I think view the other the others as sometimes Complete Idiot's yeah it what

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :do we do with that you know is it
 possible that the people on the right are correct about their what theycurrently believe is that kind of
 open-mindedness helpful or is this division long term productive for us tosort of have this food fight well the


Speaker 0 :trouble you have to confront is that
 there's a lot of stuff that just is false out there and but commandsextensive political allegiance so the
 idea well both sides need to listen to each other respectfully I'm happy to dothat when there's a view that is worthy
 of respect but a lot of stuff is not and so take economics is something where Ithink I know something and I'm not sure
 that I'm always right in fact I know I've been wrong plenty of times but Ithink there is a difference between
 economic views that are within the realm of we can we can actually have aninteresting discussion and those that
 are just crank doctrines or things that that are purely being disseminatedbecause people are being paid to
 disseminate them so there are there are plenty of good serious center-righteconomists that are happy to to talk to
 none of those center-right economists has any role in the Trump administrationthe Trump administration and by a large
 Republicans in Congress only want to listen to people who are cranks and so Ithink it's being dishonest with my
 readers too to pretend otherwise there's no way I can reach out to people whothink that that reading ain't ran novels
 is is is how you learned about monetary economics let me linger on that point so

Speaker 1 :if you look at Iran okay
 so you said center-right what about extreme people who have like radicalviews you think they're not grounded in
 any kind of data in the kind of reality I'm just sort of curious about how openwe should be to ideas that seem radical


Speaker 0 :Oh radical ideas is fine but then you
 have to asked I have to ask is there some basis for the radicalism and ifit's if it's a if it's something that is
 not grounded in anything then and particularly by the way if it'ssomething that's been refuted by
 evidence again and again and people just keep saying if it's a zombie idea andthere's a lot of those out there then
 there comes a point when it's not worth trying to fake respect for it

Speaker 1 :I see so there's a through the
 scientific process you've shown that this idea does not hold water but I likethe idea zombie ideas but they live on
 through it's like the idea that the earth is flat for example has been forthe most part that's proven yeah but it
 lives on actually is growing in popularity currently yeah and there's a

Speaker 0 :lot of that out there and there you
 can't you can't wish it away and it's you're not being fair to either yourselfor if you're somebody who writes for the
 public you're not being fair to your

Speaker 1 :readers to pretend otherwise so quantum
 mechanics is a strange theory but it's testable and so while being strangestwidely accepted among physicists how
 robust and testable our economics theories if we compare them to quantummechanics and physics and so on okay


Speaker 0 :economics look it's a complex system and
 it's also one in which by and large you don't get to do experiments and soeconomics is never going to be like
 quantum mechanics that said you get natural experiments you get tests ofrival doctrines you know in the
 immediate aftermath of the financial crisis there was one style one onebasic theory of macroeconomics which
 ultimately goes back to John Maynard Keynes that made a few predictions itsaid under these circumstances printing
 money will not be inflationary running big budget deficits will not react causea rise in interest rates slashing
 government spending austerity policies will lead to two depressions if triedother people who had you know exactly
 the opposite predictions and we got a fairly robust test and you know one onetheory one interest rates stayed low
 inflation stayed low austerity countries that implanted harsh austerity policiessuffered severe economic downturns you
 don't get much you know that's that's pretty clear and that's not going to betrue on everything but there's a lot of
 empirical I mean the younger economists these days are very heavy heavily database syndrome and it's and that's great
 and I'm I think that's that's the way to go

Speaker 1 :what theories of economics there is
 there currently a lot of disagreement

Speaker 0 :about would you say Oh first of all
 there's just a lot less disagreement really among serious researchers ineconomics than people imagine when we
 actually we contract that the Chicago Booth School has a panel anideologically diverse panel and they
  oppose the regularly posed questions and on most thing therethere's a huge that there's remarkable
 consensus there's a lot of of things where there you people imagine thatthere's dispute but that the the
 illusion of dispute is something that's basically being fed by political forcesand and there isn't really I mean there
 are I think we questions about what are effective ways to regulate technologyindustries we really don't know the
 answer is there there's a or what I don't follow every part minimum wagesI think there's there's
 pretty overwhelming evidence that that a modest increase in the minimum wage fromcurrent levels would be would not have
 any noticeable adverse effect on jobs but if you asked how high could it go$12 seems pretty safe given what we know
 15 is 15 okay there's some legitimate disagreement there I think probably butbut I can people have a point 20 where
 where is the line at which it starts to become a problem and the answer is trulywe don't know it's fascinating to try to


Speaker 1 :such a cool economics is cool in that
 sense a you because you're trying to predict something that hasn't been donebefore the impact the effects of
 something that hasn't been done before

Speaker 0 :yeah you're trying you're going
 out-of-sample and and we have good reason to believe that that there are nothat it's nonlinear that there comes a
 point at which it doesn't work the way

Speaker 1 :it has in the past so as an economist
 how do you see science and technological innovation when I took various economicscourses in college technological
 innovations seem like a no-brainer way of growing an economy and we shouldinvest in it aggressively yeah I may be
 biased but it seemed like the various ways to grow an economy it seems likethe easiest way especially long term is
 that correct and if so why aren't we

Speaker 0 :doing it more well that's okay
 the first question is yeah I mean all it's pretty much overwhelming we thinkwe can more or less measure this
 although there are some assumptions involved but it's something like 70 to80 percent of the growth in per capita
 income is is basically the advance of knowledge it's not just it's not just acrude accumulation of capital it is it
 is the fact that we can get smarter a lot of that by the way is more prosaickinds of technology so you know we I
 like to talk about things like containerization or you know an earlierperiod the you know the invention of the
 flat a cardboard box I have to be inventedand and now all of your deliveries from
 Amazon are made possible by the existence of that technology that theweb stuff is important to but but what
 would we do without cardboard boxes so but all of that stuff is reallyimportant in driving economic progress
 why don't we invest more why don't we invest more in you againmore prosaic stuff why aren't why
 haven't we built another goddamn real tunnel under the Hudson River which isfor which the need is is so totally
 overwhelmingly obvious how do you think

Speaker 1 :about first of all I don't even know
 what the word prosaic means but I inferred it but how do you think aboutprosaic is it the really most basic dumb
 technology innovation or is it just like the lowest hanging fruit of warbenefiting me gained when I say prosaic


Speaker 0 :I mean stuff that is not sexy and and
 fancy and high-tech it's building bridges and tunnels having inventing thecardboard box were the I don't know
 where do we put EZ Pass in there that's a it is it is actually using some themodern technology and all that but it
 it's you're not gonna have I don't think you're gonna make a movie about aboutthe fact that the guy who ever wasn't
 that easy pass but but it's actually a pretty significant productivity booster

Speaker 1 :to me it always seem like it's something
 that everybody should be able to agree on and just invest so like in the sameway there's the investment in the
 military and the DoD is huge so everyone kind of not everyone but there's athere's a there's an agreement amongst
 people that somehow that a large defense is important it always seemed to me likethat should be shifted towards if you
 want to grow prosperity of the nation you should be investing in knowledgeyes prosaic stuff infrastructure
 investing infrastructure and so on I mean sorry to linger on it but do youhave any intuition do you have a hope
 that that changes the idea of intuition why it's not changing it's uncommon in

Speaker 0 :tradition I have a theory I'm reasonably
 certain that I understand why why we don't do it and it's it's becausebecause we have a real values dispute
 about the welfare state about how much the government should do to help theunfortunate and politicians believe
 probably rightly that there's a kind of halo effect that surrounds any kind ofgovernment intervention that even though
 providing people with enhanced Social Security benefits is really verydifferent from building a tunnel under
 the Hudson River politicians of both parties seem to believe that it's thegovernment is seen to be successful at
 doing one kind of thing it will make people think more favorably on doingother kinds of things and so we have
 conservatives tend to be opposed to any kind of increase in government spendingexcept military no matter how obviously
 a good idea it is because they fear that it's the thin end of the wedge forbigger government in general and to some
 extent liberals tend to favor spending on these things partly because they seeit as a way of proving that government
 can do things well and therefore it can turn to broader social goals it'sclearly can there's a if you like the
 what you might have thought would be a technocratic discussion about governmentinvestment both in research and in
 infrastructure is contaminated by the fact that government is government andpeople link it to other government
 actions

Speaker 1 :perhaps silly question but as a species
 we're currently working on venturing out into spaceone day colonizing Mars so when we start
 a society on Mars from scratch what political and economic system should

Speaker 0 :operate under oh I'm a big believer in
 first of all I don't think we're actually gonna do that but does let's uhlet's imagine hypothesize that we
 colonize Mars or something look representative democracy is vs. pure

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :democracy well yeah but pure democracy
 where people vote directly on everything his is really problematic because peopledon't have time to to to try and master
 every issue I mean we could see what government by referendum looks likethere's a lot of that in in California
 and it's uh it doesn't work so good because it's hard to explain to peoplethat the various things they vote for
 may conflict so representative democracy is it's got lots of problems and I kindof Winston Churchill thing right it's
 the worst system well you know except for all the others but so yes thinking

Speaker 1 :with a representative and basically the
 American system of regulation and markets and the economy we have going onis a pretty pretty good one for Mars if


Speaker 0 :you start from scratch if you didn't
 start from scratch you wouldn't you wouldn't want to send it where sixteenpercent of the population has half the
 seats you probably would want one which is more actually more representativethan what we have and the details it's
 unclear I mean the we when times are good all of the various representativedemocracy systems whether it's
 parliamentary democracies or a us-style system whether you have a prime ministeror the head of state as an elected
 president they all kind of work well then they all when times are good andthey all have different modes of
 breakdowns I'm not sure I know what the answer isbut but something like that is given
 what we've seen through history it's the least bad system out there I mean Idon't know I'm a big fan of the TV
 series the expanse and it's kind of gratifying that out there they the it'sthe Martian congressional republic okay


Speaker 1 :in a brief sense so amongst many things
 you're also an expert in international trade what do you make of the thecomplexity so I can understand trade
 between two people say to neighboring farmers it seems pretty straightforwardto me but international we need to start
 talking about nations and nations trading seems to be very complicated sofrom a high level why is it so
 complicated what are all the different factors that weigh the objectives needto be considered an international trade
 and maybe feeding that into a question of you have concerns about the twogiants right now of the u.s. in China
 and an intention that's going on with the international trade there with the

Speaker 0 :trade war well first of all
 international trade is not really that different from trade among individualswhen it's it it's vastly more complex
 and there are there are many more players but in the end the reasons whycountries trade are pretty much the same
 as the reasons why individuals trade you countries trade because they'redifferent and they can derive mutual
 advantage from concentrating the things they do relatively well and also thereare the economies of scale you know you
 don't not individuals have to decide whether to be a surgeon or a or anaccountant it's probably not a good idea
 to try and be both in countries benefit from specializing just because of theinherent advantages of specialization
 and that's so the now the the fact it's a big world andthey were talking about millions of
 products being traded and in today's world often trade involves many stagesso that made in China iPhone is actually
 assembled from components that are made all over the world and but it doesn'treally change the the fundamentals all
 that much there's a recurrence I mean that the baked the big the dirty littlesecret of international trade conflict
 is that actually it's not conflicts among countries are really not thatimportant most trade is beneficial to
 both sides and to both countries but it has big impacts on the distribution ofincome within countries so the growth of
 US trade with China has made both US and China richer but it's been pretty badfor people who were employed in the
 North Carolina furniture industry who did find that their jobs were displacedby a wave of imports from China and so
 that's where the complexity comes in not at all clear to me I mean they we havesome real problems with China though
 they really involve trade so much as as things like respect for intellectualproperty not clear that those real
 problems that we do have with China have anything to do with the current tradewar trade war seems to be driven instead
 by a fundamentally wrong notion that when we sell goods to China that's goodand when we buy goods from China that's
 bad and that's that's misunderstanding the whole point he's a is trade which

Speaker 1 :I'm in both directions a good thing yeah


Speaker 0 :we would be poorer if it wasn't for it
 but it but there are there are downsides as there are for any economic changeit's like any new technology makes us
 richer but often hurts some place some people trade with Chinamakes us richer but hurt some people and
 I I wouldn't undo what has happened but I wish we had had a better policy forsupporting incumbents
 the losers from that growth so we live

Speaker 1 :in a time of rec reticle ization of
 political ideas Twitter mobs and so on and yet here you are in the midst of itboth tweeting and writing in New York
 Times articles strong opinions riding this chaotic wave of public discoursedo you ever hesitate or feel a tinge of
 fear for exploring your ideas publicly and unapologetically oh I feel fear all

Speaker 0 :the time
 it's not too hard to imagine scenarios in which this is I might personally findmyself kind of in there in the
 crosshairs and I mean I'm the I am the king of hate mail I get them amazingcorrespondents uh does it affect you it
 did that it did when I started these days I've developed a very thick skin soI know I don't usually get in fact if I
 if I don't get a wave of hate mail after a column then then I've probably wasted

Speaker 1 :the that that day so what do you make of
 that as a as a person who's putting ideas out there if you look at thehistory of ideas the way it works is you
 write about ideas you put them out there but now when there is so much hate mailso much division what advice do you have
 for yourself and for others trying to have a discussion about ideas difficult

Speaker 0 :ideas well I don't know what about
 advice for others I mean if for most economists you just do your researchthat's a we can't all be public
 intellectuals and we shouldn't try to be and in fact I I I'm glad that I didn'tget into this business until I was and
 until I was in my late 40s I mean this is it's probably best to spend the theyour decades of greatest intellectual
 flexibility addressing deep questions not not confronting Twitter mobs and theand as for the rest point I think when
 you're writing about stuff the sort of dance it's like no one's watchinglike nobody is reading right right what
 your than what you think is right Jaya trying to make it obviously tryingto make it it comprehensible and
 persuasive but don't let yourself get intimidated by the fact that some peopleare going to say say nasty things it's
 you can't you can't do you can't do your job if you are worried about criticism

Speaker 1 :well I think I speak for a lot of people
 and saying that I hope that you keep dancing like nobody's watching onTwitter and New York Times and books so
