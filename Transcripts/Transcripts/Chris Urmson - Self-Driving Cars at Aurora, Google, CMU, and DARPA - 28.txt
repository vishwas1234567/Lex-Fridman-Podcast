Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Chris Urmson he was a CTO of the Google self-driving car team a key engineer andleader behind the Carnegie Mellon
 University autonomous vehicle entries in

Speaker 0 :the DARPA Grand Challenges and the
 winner of the DARPA urban challenge

Speaker 1 :today he's the CEO of Aurora innovation
 and the autonomous vehicle software company he started with sterlingAnderson who was the former director of
 Tesla autopilot and drew back now Uber's former autonomy and perception leadchris is one of the top roboticists and
 autonomous vehicle experts in the world and a longtime voice of reason in aspace that is shrouded in both mystery
 and hype he both acknowledges the incredible challenges involved insolving the problem of autonomous


Speaker 0 :driving and is working hard to solve it

Speaker 0 :conversation with Chris Armisen


Speaker 1 :you were part of both the DARPA Grand
 Challenge and the DARPA urban challenge teams at CMU with red Whittaker whattechnical or philosophical things have
 you learned from these races I think the

Speaker 0 :the high order bit was that it could be
 done I think that was the thing that was incredible about the first the the GrandChallenges that I remember you know I
 was a grad student at Carnegie Mellon and there we was kind of this dichotomyof it seemed really hard so that'd be
 cool and interesting but you know at the time we were the only robotics Institutearound and so if we went into it and
 fell on our faces that would that would be embarrassing so I think you know justhaving the will to go do it to try to do
 this thing that at the time was marked as you know darn near impossible and andthen after a couple of tries be able to
 actually make it happen I think that was you know that was really exciting but at

Speaker 1 :which point did you believe it was
 possible did you from the very beginning did youpersonally because you're one of the
 lead engineer you actually had to do a

Speaker 0 :lot of the work yeah I was the technical
 director there and did al huddle the work along with a bunch of other reallygood people
 did I believe it could be done yeah of course right like why would you go dosomething you thought was impossible
 completely impossible we thought it was gonna be hard we didn't know how we'regonna be able to do it we didn't know if
 we'd be able to do it the first time turns out we couldn'tthat yeah I guess you have to I think
 there's a certain benefit to naivete right that if you don't know how hardsomething really is you you try
 different things and you know gives you an opportunity that others who are youknow wiser maybe don't don't have what


Speaker 1 :were the biggest pain points mechanical
 sensors hardware software algorithms for mapping localization just generalperception control what the hardware
 soft first of all I think that's the joy

Speaker 0 :of this field is that it's all hard and
 that's you have to be good at at each part of it so for the first for theurban challenges if I look back at it
 from today it should be easy today that you know itwas a static world there weren't other
 actors moving through it that is what that means it was out in the desert soyou get really good GPS you know so that
 that went in you know we could map it roughly and so in retrospect now it'syou know it's it's within the realm of
 things we could do back then just actually getting the vehicle and the youknow there's a bunch of engineering work
 to get the vehicle so that we could control and drive it that's you knowthat's still a pain today but it was
 even more so back then and then the uncertainty of exactly what they wantedus to do was was part of the challenge


Speaker 1 :as well right you didn't actually know
 the track heading in you know approximately but you know it didn'tactually know the route the route that's


Speaker 0 :gonna be taken that's right we didn't
 know the route we didn't even really the way the rules had been described you hadto kind of guess so if you think back to
 that challenge the idea was to that the the government would give us the DARPAwould give us a set of waypoints and
 kind of the width that you had to stay within between the line that wentbetween you know each of those waypoints
 and so the the most devious thing they could have done is set you know akilometer wide corridor across you know
 a field of scrub brush and rocks and said you know go figure it outfortunately it really it turned into
 basically driving along a set of trails which you know is much more relevant toto the application they were looking for
 but no it was it was a hell of a thing

Speaker 1 :back in the day so the legend read was
 kind of leading that effort in terms just broadly speaking so you're a leadernow what have you learned from reading


Speaker 0 :about leadership I think there's a
 couple things one is you know go and try those really hard things that that'swhere there is an incredible opportunity
 I think the other big one though is to see people for who they can be not whothey are it's one of the things that I
 actually one of the deepest lessons I learned from read was that he would lookat you know undergraduates or graduate
 students and empower them to be leaders to to you know have responsibility to dogreat things that I think another person
 might look at them and think oh that's just you know another graduate studentwhat could they know and so I think that
 that you know kind of trust but verify I have confidence and what people canbecome I think is a really powerful


Speaker 1 :thing so through that it's just like
 fast-forward through the history can you maybe talk through the technicalevolution of autonomous vehicle systems
 from the first to Grand Challenges to the urban challenge to today are theremajor shifts in your mind or is it the
 same kind of technology just made more

Speaker 0 :robust I think there's been some big big
 steps so the for the grand challenge the realtechnology that unlocked that was HD
 mapping prior to that a lot of the off-road robotics work had been donewithout any real prior model of what the
 vehicle was going to encounter and so that innovation that the fact that wecould get you know decimeter resolution
 models was really a big deal and that allowed us to to kind of bound thecomplexity of the driving problem the
 vehicle had and allowed it to operate at speed because we could assume thingsabout the environment that it was going
 to encounter so that was a that was one of the that was the big step therefor the urban challenge you know one of
 the big technological innovations there was the multi beam lidar and being ableto generate a high resolution you know
 mid to long range 3d models the world and use that for you know forunderstanding the world around the
 vehicle and that was really a you know kind of a game-changing technology inparallel with that we saw a bunch of
 other technologies that have been kind of converging half their their day inthe Sun so Bayesian estimation had been
 you know slam had been a big field in robotics you know you would go to aconference you know a couple years
 before that and every paper would effectively have slams somewhere in itand so seeing that you know that looks
 Bayesian estimation techniques you know play out on a very visible stage youknow I thought that was that was pretty
 exciting to see

Speaker 1 :and mostly slam was done based on lidar


Speaker 0 :that time well yeah and in fact we
 weren't really doing slam per se you know it you know in real time because wehad a model ahead of time we had a road
 map but we were doing localization and we were using you know the lidar or thecameras depending on you know who
 exactly was doing it to localize to a model of the world and I thought thatwas that was a big step from kind of
 naively trusting GPS I and s before that and and again like lots of work had beengoing on in this field certainly this
 was not doing anything particularly innovative in slam over in localizationbut it was seeing that technology
 necessary in a real application on a big

Speaker 1 :stage I thought was very cool so for the
 urban challenge that was already maps constructed offline yes in general okayand did people do that individually
 individual teams do it individually so they had their own difference ofdifferent approaches there or they never
 really kind of share that information at least

Speaker 0 :intuitively so so the DARPA gave all the
 teams a a model of the world they you know a map and then you know one of thethings that we had to figure out back
 then was and it's still one of these things that trips people up today isactually the coordinate system so you
 get a latitude longitude and you know - so many decimal places you don't reallycare about kind of the ellipsoid of the
 earth that's being used but when you want to get to ten centimeter orcentimeter resolution you care whether
 the the core system is you know Nats 83 or wgs84 or you know these are differentways to describe both the the kind of
 non spherical nosov the earth but also kind of the actually in I think I can'tremember which one the tectonic shifts
 that are happening and how to transform you know the the global datum as afunction of that so you're getting a map
 and then actually matching it to reality two centimeter resolution that was kindof interesting and fun back then so how


Speaker 1 :much work was the perception doing there
 so how how much were you relying on localization based on maps without usingperception to register to the maps and
 how I guess the question is how advanced was perception at that point it's

Speaker 0 :certainly behind where we are today
 right we're we're more than a decade since the graph or the urban challengebut the the core of it was there that we
 were tracking vehicles we had to do that at a hundred plus meter range because wehad to merge with other traffic we were
 using you know Bayesian again Bayesian estimates for for state of thesevehicles we had to deal with a bunch of
 the problems that you you think of today of predicting what that where thatvehicle is going to be a few seconds
 into the future we had to deal with the fact that there were multiple hypothesesfor that because a vehicle at an
 intersection might be going right or it might be going straight or I'd be makinga left turn
 and we had to deal with the challenge of the fact that our behavior was going toimpact the behavior of that other upper
 operator and you know we did a lot of that in relative Najee relatively naiveways but it caused third still had to


Speaker 1 :have some kind of Thanos yeah and so
 where does that ten years later where does that take us today from thatartificial city construction to real
 cities to the urban environment yeah I

Speaker 0 :think the the biggest thing is that the
 you know the the actors are truly unpredictable that most of the time youknow the drivers on the road the other
 road users are out there behaving well but everyone's father ornot the variety of other vehicles is you
 know you have all of the intended

Speaker 1 :behavior in terms of perception or both


Speaker 0 :that we have you know back then we
 didn't have to deal with cyclists we didn't have to deal with pedestriansdidn't have to deal with traffic lights
 you know the scale over which that you have to operate us now you know is muchlarger than you know the airbase that we
 were thinking about back then

Speaker 1 :so what easy question what do you think
 is the hardest part about driving easy

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :question yeah no I'm joking I I'm sure
 no nothing really jumps out at you as one thing but in in the jump from theurban challenge to the real world is
 there something that's a particularly for seus very serious difficult

Speaker 0 :challenge I think the most fundamental
 difference is that were doing it for real and that in that environment it wasboth a limited complexity environment
 because certain actors weren't there because you know the roads weremaintained there were barriers keeping
 people separate from from robots at the time and it only had to work for 60miles which looking at it from you know
 2006 it had to work for 60 miles yeah right looking at it from now you know wewe want things that will go and drive
 for you know half a half a million miles and you know it's just a it's a

Speaker 1 :different game so how important he said
 leiter came into the game early on and it's really the primary driver ofautonomous vehicles today as a sensor so
 how important is the role of lidar in the sense of suite in the near term so I

Speaker 0 :think it's I think it's essential you
 know I believe it but I also believe is the cameras are essential and I believethe radars is essential I think that you
 you really need to use the composition of data from from these differentsensors if you want the thing to to


Speaker 1 :really be robust the question I want to
 ask let's see if we kind of tangle is what are your thoughts on the Elon Muskprovocative statement that lidar is a
 crutch that is the kind of I guess growing pains and that's much of theperception tasks can be done with


Speaker 0 :cameras so I think it is undeniable that
 people walk around without you know lasers in their foreheadand they can get into vehicles and drive
 them and and so there's an existence proof that you can drive using you knowpassive fission no doubt can't argue


Speaker 1 :with that in terms of sensors yeah so


Speaker 0 :yes maybe sensors right so like there's
 there's an example that we all go do it have many of us everyday in terms oflatter being a crutch sure but but you
 know in the same way that you know the combustion engine was a crutch on thepath to an electric vehicle on the same
 way that you know any technology ultimately getsreplaced by some superior technology in
 the future and really what with the way that I look at this is that the way weget around on the ground the way that we
 use transportation is broken and that we have you know this this you know whatwas I think the number I saw this
 morning 37,000 Americans killed last year on our roads and that's just notacceptable and so tech any technology
 that we can bring to bear that accelerates the this techno you knowself-driving technology coming to market
 and saving lives is technology we should be using and it feels just arbitrary tosay well you know I'm I'm not okay with
 using lasers because that's whatever but I am okay with using an 8 megapixelcamera or a 16 megapixel camera you know
 like it's just these are just bits of technology and we should be taking thebest technology from the tool bin that
 allows us to go and you know and solve a

Speaker 1 :problem the question I often talk to
 well obviously you do as well to sort of automotive companies and you know ifthere's one word that comes up more
 often than anything is costs and and trying to drive cost down so while it'sit's true that it's a tragic number the
 37,000 the the question is what and I'm not the one asking these questions Ihate this question but yeah we want to
 find the cheapest sensor suite that the creates a safe vehicle so in thatuncomfortable trade-off do you foresee
 lidar coming down in cost in the future or do you see a day where level forautonomy is possible without lighter I


Speaker 0 :see both of those but it's really a
 matter of time and I think really maybe the I would talk to the question youasked about you know the cheapest set
 certainly I don't think that's actually what you want what you want is a sensorsuite that is economically viable and
 then after that everything is about margin and driving cost out of thesystem what you also want is a sense
 suite that were and so it's great to tell a story abouthow you know how it'd be better to have
 a self-driving system with a $50 sensor instead of a you know a $500 dancer butif the $500 sensor makes it work and the
 $50 sensor doesn't work you know who cares the longest you can actually youhave an economic offer you know there's
 an economic opportunity there and the economic opportunity is importantbecause that's how you actually have a
 sustainable business and that's how you can actually see this come to scale andand and be out in the world and so when
 I look at lidar I see a technology that has no underlying fundamentally you knowexpense to it fundamental expense to it
 it's it's going to be more expensive than an imager because you know CMOSprocesses or you know fab processes are
 dramatically more scalable than mechanical processes but we still shouldbe able to drive cost out substantially
 on that side and then I also do think that with the right business model youcan absorb more you know certainly more
 cost on the Bill of Materials yeah if

Speaker 1 :the sense of sweetie works extra values
 provided thereby you don't need to drive costs down to zero it's the basiceconomics you've talked about your
 intuition that level to autonomy is problematic because of the human factorof vigilance that command complacency
 over trust and so on just us being human yeah we trust the system we start doingeven more so partaking in the secondary
 activities like smart phone and so on have your views evolved on this point ineither direction can you can you speak


Speaker 0 :to it so and I want to be really careful
 because sometimes this gets twist in a way that's that that Icertainly didn't intend so active safety
 systems are a really important technology that we should be pursuingand integrating into vehicles and
 there's an opportunity in the near term to reduce accidents reduce fatalitiesand that's and we should be we should be
 pushing on that level two systems are systems where the vehicle is controllingtwo axes so in breaking and braking and
 throttle / steering and I think there are variants of level two systems thatare supporting the driver that
 absolutely like we should we should encourage to be out there where I thinkthere's a real challenge is in the the
 human factors part around this and the misconception from the public around thecapability set that that enables and the
 trust they should have in it and that is where I you know I kind of I am actuallyincremental II more you know concerned
 around level three systems and you know how exactly a level two system ismarketed and delivered and you know how
 people how much effort people have put into those human factors so I stillbelieve several things around this one
 is people will over trust the technology we've seen over the last few weeks youknow a spate of people sleeping in their
 Tesla you know I watched an episode last night of Trevor Noahtalking about this and you know him you
 know this is a smart guy who's has a lot of resources at his disposal describinga Tesla's a self-driving car and that
 why shouldn't people be sleeping in their Tesla there's like well becauseit's not a self-driving car and it is
 not intended to be and you know these people will almost certainly you knowdie at some point or hurt other people
 and so we need to really be thoughtful about how that technology is describedand brought to market I also think that
 because of the economic issue you know Iike my economic challenges wewere just talking about
 that that technology path will ugly these level two driver assistancesystems that technology path will
 diverge from the technology path that we need to be on to actually deliver trulyself-driving vehicles ones where you can
 get it and sleep and have the equivalent or better safety then you know a humandriver behind the wheel because the
 again the economics are very different in those two worlds and so that leads toyou know divergent technology so you


Speaker 1 :just don't see the economics of
 gradually increasing from level two and doing so quickly enough to where itdoesn't cost safety critical safety
 concerns you believe that the it needs to diverge at this point in twodifferent basically different routes and


Speaker 0 :really that comes back to what are those
 l2 and l1 systems doing and and they are driver systems functions where the thethe people that are marketing that
 responsibly are being very clear and putting human factors in place such thatthe driver is actually responsible for
 the vehicle and that the technology is there to support the driver and thesafety cases that are built around those
 or dependence on that driver attention and attentiveness and at that point youyou can kind of give up
 to some degree for economic reasons you can give up on safe false negatives andso and the way to think about this is
 for a for collision mitigation braking system if it half the times the drivermissed a vehicle in front of it it hit
 the brakes and brought the vehicle to a stop that would be an incredibleincredible advance and in safety on our
 roads right that would be equivalent to seatbelts but it would mean that if thatvehicle wasn't being monitored it would
 hit one out of two cars and so economically that's a perfectly goodsolution for a driver assistance system
 what you should do at that point if you can get it to work 50 percent of thetime is drive the cost out of that so
 you can get it on as many vehicles as possible but driving the cost out of itdoesn't drive up performance on the
 false negative case and so you'll continue to not have a technology thatcould you know really be available for


Speaker 1 :for a self driven vehicle so clearly the
 communication and this probably applies though for vehicles as well themarketing and a communication of what
 the technology is actually capable of how hard it is how easy it is all thatkind of stuff is highly problematic so
 but it's say everybody in the world was perfectly communicated and were made tobe completely aware of every single
 technology out there what they what it's able to do what's your intuition and nowmaybe getting into philosophical ground
 is it possible to have a level 2 vehicle where we don't over trust it I don't

Speaker 0 :think so if people truly understood the
 risks and internalized it then then sure you could do that safely but that that'sa world that doesn't exist that people
 are going to they're gonna you know if the facts are put in front of themthey're gonna then combine that with
 their experience and you know let's say they're they're using an l2 system andthey go up and down the 101 every day
 and they do that for a month and it just worked every day for a month like that'spretty compelling at that point you know
 just even if you know the statistics like wellI don't know maybe there's something
 funny about those maybe they're you know driving in difficult places like I'veseen it with my own eyes it works and
 the problem is that that sample size that they have so it's 30 miles up butnow so 60 miles times 30 days so 60 180
 a thousand eight hundred miles that's that's a drop in the bucket compared tothe one you know what eighty-five
 million miles between fatalities and so they don't really have a true estimatebased on their personal experience of
 the real risks but they're gonna trust it anyway because it's hard not to workfor a month
 West what's gonna change so even if you

Speaker 1 :start at perfect understanding of the
 system your own experience will make it drift and that's a big concern you knowover a year over two years even it


Speaker 0 :doesn't have to be months and I think
 that as this technology moves from what I say it's kind of the more technologysavvy ownership group to you know the
 mass market you may be able to have some of those folks who are really familiarwith technology they may be able to
 internalize it better and you know you're kind of immunization against thiskind of false risk assessment might last
 longer but as folks who are who aren't as savvy about that you know read thematerial and they compare that to their
 personal experience I think there that you know it's it's going to it's gonnamove more quickly so your work the


Speaker 1 :program that you've created a Google and
 now at Aurora is focused more on the second path of creating full autonomy soit's such a fascinating I think it's one
 of the most interesting AI problems of the century right it's a I just talkedto a lot of people just regular people I
 don't know my mom about autonomous vehicles and you begin to grapple withideas of giving your life control over
 to a machine is philosophically interesting it's practically interestingso let's talk about safety how do you
 think we demonstrate you spoken about metrics in the past how do you think wedemonstrate to the world that an
 autonomous vehicle an Aurora system is safe

Speaker 0 :this is one where it's difficult because
 there isn't a soundbite answer that we have to show a combination of work thatwas done diligently and thoughtfully and
 this is where something like a functional safety process as part ofthat is like here's here's the way we
 did the work that means that we were very thorough so you know if you believethat we what we said about this is the
 way we did it then you can have some confidence that we were thorough in inin the engineering work we put into the
 system and then on top of that the you know to kind of demonstrate that weweren't just thorough we were actually
 good at what we did there'll be a kind of a collection of evidence in terms ofdemonstrating that the capabilities work
 the way we thought they did you know statistically and and to whatever degreewe can we can demonstrate that both in
 some combination of simulations some combination of unit testing anddecomposition testing and then some part
 of it will be on Road data and and I think the the way we will ultimatelyconvey this to the public is they'll be
 clearly some conversation with the public about it but we'll you know kindof invoke the the kind of the trusted
 nodes and that will spend more time being able to go into more depth withfolks like like nitsa and other federal
 and state regulatory bodies and kind of given that they are operating in thepublic interest and they're trusted
 that if we can you know show enough work to them that they're convinced then youknow I think we're in a in a pretty good
 place

Speaker 1 :that means you work with people that are
 essentially experts at safety to try to discuss and show do you think the answeris probably no but just in case do you
 think there exists a metric so currently people have been using number ofdisengagement yeah and it quickly turns
 into a marketing scheme to just sort of you alter the experiments you run toadjust I think you've spoken that you


Speaker 0 :don't like no Mohammed no in fact I I
 was on the record telling DMV that I thought this was not a great metric do

Speaker 1 :you think it's possible to create a
 metric a number that that could demonstrate safety outside of fatalities

Speaker 0 :so so I I do and I think that it won't
 be just one number so as we are internally grappling with us and at somepoint we'll be we'll be able to talk
 more publicly about it is how do we think about human performance indifferent tasks say detecting traffic
 lights or safely making a left turn across traffic and what do we think thefailure rates are for those different
 capabilities for people and then demonstrating to ourselves and thenultimately folks the regulatory role and
 and then ultimately the public that we have confidence that our system willwork better than that and so these these
 individual metrics will can tell a compelling story ultimately I do thinkat the end of the day what we care about
 in terms of safety is life saved and injuries reduced and then and thenultimately you know kind of casualty
 dollars that people aren't having to pay to gettheir car fixed and I do think that you
 can you know we in aviation they look at a kind of an event pyramid where youknow a crash is at the top of that and
 that's the worst event obviously and then there's injuries and you knownear-miss events and whatnot and and you
 know violation of operating procedures and and you kind of build a statisticalmodel of the relevance of the low
 severity things to the high spirit of things I think that's something wherewe'll be able to look at as well because
 you know an event per 85 million miles that you know statistically a difficultthing even at the scale of the u.s. to


Speaker 1 :to to kind of compare directly and that
 event the fatality that's connected to an autonomous vehicle is significantlyat least currently magnified in the
 amount of attention and yet so that speaks to public perception I think themost popular topic about autonomous
 vehicles in the public is the trolley problem formulation right which haslet's not get into that too much but is
 misguided but in many ways but it speaks to the fact that people are grapplingwith this idea of giving control over to
 a machine so how do you win the hearts and minds of the people that autonomy issomething that could be a part of their


Speaker 0 :lives thank you let them experience it
 alright I think it's I think I think it's right I think people should beskeptical I think people should ask
 questions I think they should doubt because this is something new anddifferent
 they haven't touched it yet and I think it's perfectly reasonable and but at thesame time it's clear there's an
 opportunity to make the roads safer it's clear that we can improve access tomobility it's clear that we can reduce
 the cost of mobility and that once people try that and are you knowunderstand that it's safe and are able
 to use in their daily lives I think it's one of these things that will will justbe obvious and I've seen this
 practically in you know demonstrations that I've youknow given where I've had people come in
 and you know they're very skeptical they again in a vehicle you know my favoriteone is taking somebody out on the
 freeway and we're on the 101 driving at 65 miles an hourand after ten minutes they they kind of
 turn and ask is that all it does and you're like yeah it's self-driving carnot sure exactly which I thought it
 would be right but they you know they it becomes mundane which is which isexactly what you want a technology like
 this to be right we don't really when I turn the light switch on in here I don'tthink about the complexity of you know
 the those electrons you know being pushed down a wire from wherever it wasand being generated it's not like it's
 just it's like I just get annoyed if it doesn't work right and and what I valueis the fact that I can do other things
 in this space I can you know see my colleagues I can read stuff on a paper Ican you know not be afraid of the dark
 and I think that's what we want this technology to be like is it's it's inthe background and people get to have
 those those life experiences and and do so safely

Speaker 1 :so putting this technology in the hands
 of people speaks to scale the deployment all right so what do you think the thedreaded question about the future
 because nobody can predict the future yeah but just maybe speak poeticallyabout when do you think we'll see a
 large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles ten thousand those kinds of

Speaker 0 :numbers you will see that within ten
 years I'm pretty confident we what's an

Speaker 1 :impressive scale what moment so you've
 done DARPA Challenger there's one vehicle at which moment does it becomewow this is serious scale so so I think


Speaker 0 :the moment it gets serious is when we
 really do have driverless vehicle operating on public roads and that wecan do that kind of continuously without


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :a safety dry without a safety driver in
 the vehicle I think at that moment we've we've kind of crossed the zero to onethrow
 shoulde and then it is about how do we continue to scale that how do we buildthe right business models how do we
 build the right customer experience around it so that it is actually youknow a useful product out in the world
 and I think that is really at that point it moves from a you know what is thiskind of mixed science engineering
 project into engineering and commercialization and really starting todeliver on the value that we all see
 here and you know actually making that real in the world what do you think that

Speaker 1 :deployment looks like where do we first
 see the inkling of no safety driver one or two cars here and there is it on thehighway is it in specific roads in the
 urban environment I think it's going to

Speaker 0 :be urban suburban type environments you
 know with a roar when we we thought about how to tackle this I is kind ofenfoque to think about trucking as
 opposed to urban driving and and you know the again the human intuitionaround this is that freeways are easier
 to drive on because everybody's kind of going in the same direction and you knowlanes are wider etc and I think that
 that intuition is pretty good except we don't really care about most of the timewe we care about all of the time and
 when you're driving on a freeway with a truck say 70 70 miles an hour and you'vegot 70,000 pound load with you that's
 just an incredible amount of kinetic energy and so when that goes wrong itgoes really wrong and that those those
 challenges that you see occur more rarely so you don't get to learn as allas quickly and there you know
 incrementally more difficult than urban driving but they're not easier thanurban driving and so I think this
 happens in moderate speed urban environments because they're you know ifif two vehicles crash at 25 miles per
 hour it's not good but probably everybody walks awaythose those events where there's the
 possibility for that occurring happened frequently so we get to learn morerapidly we get to do that with lower
 risk for everyone and then we can deliver value to people that they needto get from one place to another and
 then once we've got that solved then the kind of the freeway driving part of thisjust falls out but we were able to learn
 it's more safely more quickly in the

Speaker 1 :urban environment so ten years and then
 scale twenty thirty year I mean who knows if if it's sufficiently compellingexperience is created it can be faster
 and slower do you think there could be breakthroughs and what kind of breakthroughs might there be that completely
 changed that timeline again not only am I asked to predict the future oh yeahI'm asking you to predict breakthroughs
 that haven't happened yet so what's the

Speaker 0 :I think another way to ask that was
 would be if I could wave a magic wand what part of the system would I makework today to accelerate it as quick as
 possible as quickly as possible

Speaker 1 :don't say infrastructure please don't
 say infrastruc no it's definitely not

Speaker 0 :infrastructure it's really that car that
 perception forecasting capability so if if tomorrow you could give me a perfectmodel of what's happened what is
 happening and what will happen for the next five seconds around a vehicle onthe roadway that would accelerate things
 pretty dramatically how you in terms of

Speaker 1 :staying up at night are you mostly
 bothered by cars pedestrians or cyclists

Speaker 0 :so I I worry most about the vulnerable
 road users about the combination of cyclists and cars right just because Ikhlyst and pedestrians because you know
 they're not in armor you know with the cars they're biggerthey've got protection for the people
 and so the ultimate risk is is lower therewhereas a pedestrian or cyclist they're
 out in the road you know they they don't have any protection and so you know weneed to pay extra attention to that do


Speaker 1 :you think about a very difficult
 technical challenge of the fact that pedestrians if you try to protectpedestrians by being careful and slow
 they'll take advantage of that so the game theoretic dance yeah does thatworry you of how from a technical
 perspective how we solve that because as humans the way we solve that it's kindof nudge our way through the pedestrians
 which doesn't feel from a technical perspective as a appropriate algorithmbut do you think about how we solve that


Speaker 0 :problem yeah I think I think there's
 there's I think that was actually there's two different concepts there soone is am I worried that because these
 vehicles are self-driving people kind of step in the road and take advantage ofthem and I've heard this and I don't
 really believe it because if I'm driving down the road and somebody steps infront of me I'm going to stop right like
 a even if I'm annoyed I'm not going to just drive through a person stood on theroad right and so I think today people
 can take advantage of this and you and you do see some people do it I guessthere's an incremental risk because
 maybe they have lower confidence that I'm going to see them than they mighthave for an automated vehicle and so
 maybe that shifts it a little bit I think people don't want to get hit bycars and so I think that I'm not that
 worried about people walking out of the 101 and you know creating chaos morethan they would today regarding kind of
 the nudging through a big stream of pedestrians leaving a concert orsomething I think that is further down
 the technology pipeline I think that you're right that's tricky I don't thinkit's necessarily I think the algorithm
 people use for this is pretty simple Yeah right it's kind of just moveforward slowly and if somebody's really
 close and stop and and I think that that probably can be replicated pretty prettyeasily and particularly given that it's
 you don't do this at 30 miles an hour you do it at one that even in thosesituations the risk is relatively
 minimal but I you know it's not something we're thinking about in any

Speaker 1 :serious way and probably the that's less
 an algorithm problem or creating a human experience so they see AI people thatcreate a visual display that you're
 pleasantly as a pedestrian nudged out of the way yes that's a that's a yeahthat's an experienced problem not an
 algorithm problem who's the main competitor to Arora today and how do youout-compete them in the long run so we


Speaker 0 :really focus a lot of what we're doing
 here I think that you know I've said this a few times that this is a hugedifficult problem and it's great that a
 bunch of companies are tackling it because I think it's so important forsociety that somebody gets there so we
 you know we're we don't spend a whole lot of time like thinking tacticallyabout who's out there and and how do we
 beat that that that person individually what are we trying to do to go fasterultimately well part of it is the
 leadership team we have has got pretty tremendous experience and so we kind ofunderstand the landscape and understand
 where the coldest acts are to some degree and you know we try and avoidthose I think there's a part of it just
 this great team we've built people this is a technology and a company thatpeople believe in the mission of and so
 it allows us to attract just awesome people to go work we've got a culture Ithink that people appreciate that allows
 them to focus allows them to really spend time solving problems and I thinkthat keeps them energized and then we've
 invested hard invested heavily in the infrastructure and architectures that wethink will ultimately accelerate us so
 because of the folks were able to bring in early on because the the the greatinvestors we have you know we don't
 spend all of our time doing demos and kind of leaping from one demo to thenext we've been given the freedom to
 invest in infrastructure to do machine learninginfrastructure to pull data from our
 on-road testing infrastructure to use that to accelerate engineering and Ithink that that early investment and
 continuing investment and those kind of tools will ultimately allow us toaccelerate and do something pretty
 incredible Chris beautifully put

Speaker 1 :it's a good place to end thank you so
 much for talking today oh thank you very
