Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 manolis kellis his second time on the podcast he's aprofessor at mit
 and head of the mit computational biology grouphe's one of the most brilliant
 productive and kind people i've had the fortune of talking to a lotof my colleagues at mit and
 former mit faculty and students wrote to meafter our first conversation with some
 version of minos is awesome isn't he i'm glad youguys are not friends
 i am too and i'm happy that he makes timein his insanely busy schedule to sit
 down and have a chat with me quick summary of the sponsors publicgoods magic spoon
 and expressvpn please check out the sponsorsin the description to get a discount and
 to support this podcast as a side note let me say that i justgot back from talking to joe rogan on
 his podcast my fifth time on there i also got achance to record a separate conversation
 with joe on this podcast we talked on both quitea bit
 about his journey and his advice for mineone of the things that i think made his
 show special is that he just had fun and made choices thatdidn't get in the way of him having fun
 and loving life i'm learning to do just thatit's tough since i'm naturally full of
 self-doubt and anxiety but i'm learning to let go andhave fun
 even if my monotone robotic voice sometimes sounds otherwisefor joe that involved talking to his
 friends comedians especially ones that brought out thebest in him duncan trussell
 and the five-hour first episode on spotify comes to mind is an example ofthat
 duncan has been a guest probably close to if not more than 50 times on joe'spodcast
 my hope with amazing people like manolas is to find my duncan trussellmy joey diaz and yes even my
 eddie bravo obviously joe and i are very different people butultimately both love life when we can
 interact often with people we love and whoinspire us
 make us smile make us think and make us have fun when we get behind the mic of apodcast

 kalas what is beautiful about the human

Speaker 0 :epigenome
 don't get me started so first of all as an engineering featthe human epigenome manages the most
 compact the most incredible compaction you couldimagine
 so every single one of your cells contains two meters worth of dna andthis is compacted
 in a radius which is one thousandth of a millimeter that'ssix orders of magnitude to give you a
 sense of scale it's as if a string as tall as the burjal khalifa
 which is about a kilometer tall was compacted into a tiny little ballthe size of a millimeter
 and if you put it all together if you stretch the trillions of cells that wehave we have about
 30 trillion cells in your body if you stretch the dna the 2 meters worth ofdna in every one of your trillion cells
 you would basically reach all the way to jupiter

Speaker 1 :a hundred times yeah it's all curled up
 in there it's 30 trillion cells 30 trillion

Speaker 0 :human body every one of them two meters
 worth of dna so all of that is compacted through theepigenome
 the epigenome basically has the ability to compactthis massive amount of dna from here to
 jupiter 10 times into one human body into just the nuclei of one human bodyand the vast majority of human bodies
 not even these nuclei and that's sort of thestructural part
 so that's the boring part that's the structural part the functional partis way more interesting so functionally
 what the human epigenome allows you to dois basically control the
 activity patterns of thousands of genes so 20 000 genes in your human body everyone of your cells only needs
 a few thousand of those but a different few thousand of those and the way thatyour cells remember
 what their identity is is basically drivenby the epigenome so the epidural is both
 structural in sort of making this dramaticcompaction and it's also functional
 in being able to actually control the activity patterns

Speaker 1 :of all your cells now can we draw
 a definition distinction between the genome and the epigenome

Speaker 0 :again being greek epi means on top of
 so the genome is the dna and the epigenome is anything on top ofthe dna
 and there's you know three types of things on top of the dnathe first is chemical modifications on
 the dna itself so we like to think of four bases of thedna acgt
 c has a methyl form which is sometimes referred to as the fifth baseso methylc takes a different meaning
 so in the same way that you have annotationsin a orchestra score that basically say
 whether you should play something softly or loudly or space it out or you knowinterpret basically the score the human
 epigenome allows you to modify that primary score so a modified cbasically says play this one softly it's
 basically a sign of repression in a gene regulatory region i love how

Speaker 1 :you're talking about the function that
 emerges from the epigenome as a musical score

Speaker 0 :it is in many ways and uh every single
 cell plays a different part of that scoreit's like having all of human knowledge
 in 23 volumes like 23 giant books which are your chromosomesand every single cell has a different
 profession a different role some cells play thepiano
 and they're looking at chapter seven from chromosome 23 and chapter four fromchromosome two and so forth
 and each of those uh pieces are all encoding in the same dnabut what the epigenome allows you to do
 is effectively conduct the orchestra and sort of coordinate the pieces sothat every instrument plays only the
 things that it needs to play

Speaker 1 :one thing that kind of blows my mind
 maybe you can tell me your thoughts about it is thethe way evolution works with natural
 selection is uh based on the final sort ofthe entirety of the orchestra
 musical performance right and then but there's theseincredibly rich structural things
 like each one of them doing their own little job that somehow work togetherlike
 the evolution selects based on the final resultand yet all the individual pieces are
 doing like infinitely minuscule specific things how the heck

Speaker 0 :does that work
 right it's a very good insight and you can even go beyond thatand basically say evolution doesn't
 select at the level of an organism it actually selects at thelevel of whole environments whole
 ecosystems so let me break this down so youbasically have
 at the very bottom every single nucleotidebeing selected but then that nucleotides
 function is selected at the level of you know each geneand every not even its gene each
 gene regulatory control element and then those control elements are basicallyconverging
 onto the function of the gene and many genes are converging onto the functionof one cell
 and many cells are converging into the function of one tissue or organand all of these organs are converging
 onto the level of an organism but now that organism isnot in isolation
 so if you basically think about why is altruism for examplea thing why are people being nice to
 each other it was probably selected and it wasprobably selected
 because those species that were just nasty to each otherdidn't survive as a species and now if
 you think about um symbiosisof you know there's plants for example
 that love co2 and there's humans that love o2 andwe're sort of you know
 trading different types of gases to each other if you look atecosystems where one organism which is
 really nasty that organism actually died becauseeveryone they were being nasty to was
 killed off and then that kind of you knowuniverse of life is gone so basically
 what emerges is selection at so many different layersof benefit including
 you know all of these nucleotides within a bodyinteracting for the emergent functions


Speaker 1 :at the body level yeah i wonder i wonder
 if it's possible to break it down into levels that'sselection even beyond humans like you
 said environment but there's environments at all different levels tooright
 at the minuscule at the organ level the tissue level like you saidmaybe at the microscopic level it would
 be fascinating if like there's a kind of selection going on atlike
 both the quantum level and like the the galaxy level yeah yeah right yeah so

Speaker 0 :so all the different forms
 yeah let's again sort of break down these different layers so basically ifyou think about the environment
 in which a gene operates that gene of course thefirst definition of environment that we
 think of is pollution or sunlight or heat or coldand so forth that's the external
 environment but every gene also operates at the level of the internal cellularenvironment that it's in
 if i take a gene from say an african individual and i put it in a europeancontext
 will it perform the same way probably not because there's a cellular contextof thousands of other genes that that
 gene has co-evolved with you know in the out of africa event andyou know
 all of this sort of human history of evolutionso basically if you look at neandertal
 genes for example which again happened long after that uhout of africa event
 there's incompatibilities between neanderthal genesand modern human genes that can lead to
 diseases so in the context of the neonatal genomethat gene version that allele was fine
 but in the context of the modern human genome that neanderthal gene version isactually detrimental
 so it's it's you know that cellular environmentconstitutes the genetics of that gene
 but also of course all of the epigenomics of that gene it's

Speaker 1 :fascinating that the
 the gene has a history i mean we talked about this a little bit last time butjust and and then some of your research
 goes into that but the genes as they are today have have astory
 from the beginning of time and then some sometimes their story was like theirpath was useful
 for survival for the particular organisms and sometimes notthat's fascinating let me ask as a
 tangent we kind of started talking offline aboutneanderthals uh
 do you have something interesting genetically biologicallyin terms of difference between uh
 neanderthal and like the different branches of humanevolution that


Speaker 0 :you find fascinating neanderthals are
 only one of about five branches that we are pretty confident about onebranches of
 of out of africa events so basically there's neanderthalsthere's denisovans what is the evidence
 for denisovans one tiny little fragment of one pinkyfrom one cave in siberia


Speaker 1 :recent relatively recently discovered


Speaker 0 :right less than 10 years ago yeah


Speaker 1 :and those are like little folks right no


Speaker 0 :no no no no that's yet another one
 though homo florences it had the little folks in sort ofindonesia but then
 uh denisovans are basically another branch that we only knowabout genetically from that one bone and
 eventually we realize that it's one of the threemajor branches along with neanderthal
 modern human and denisovan and then that one branchhas now resurfaced in many different
 areas and we kind of know about the gene flow that happened in between themso when i was reading my greek mythology
 it was talking about the age of the heroesthese eras of human like
 you know precursors that were wiped out by zeus or by all kindsof wars and so forth like the titans and
 the you know it's it's ridiculous to sort ofread these stories as a kid because
 you're like oh yeah whatever and then you're growing up and you're like whoalayers and layers of human-like
 ancestors and who knows if those stories wereinspired by bones that they found that
 kind of looked human-like but were not quite human-like who knowsif stories of dragons were inspired by
 bones of dinosaurs basically this archaeological evidencehas been there
 and has probably entered the folk imaginationmigrated into those stories but it's not
 that far you know removed from what actually happenedof massive wars of wiping out
 neanderthals as humans are modern humans arepopulating um


Speaker 1 :you know europe do you think do you
 think what killed the neanderthals and all those other branches is humanconflict or is it genetic conflict so
 is it uh us humans being the opposite of altruistic towards eachother or
 is it uh some other uh competition at some other level likeas we're discussing


Speaker 0 :yeah so if you look at a lot of human
 traits today they're probably not that far removedfrom the human traits that got us where
 we are now so you know this whole tribalismyou know your my sports team or
 your my you know political party or you're myyou know tiny little village and
 therefore you know if you're from that othervillage i hate you but as soon as we're
 both in the major city i can't believe we'refrom the same region my friend come
 and like two neighboring countries fighting and as soon as they're off inanother country they're like oh i can't
 believe that right so it's it's kind of funny like thistribalism is nonsensical in many ways
 it's like cognitive incongruent that basically welike
 kin and selection for for sort of liking kin is hugelyadvantageous genetically


Speaker 1 :probably across all kinds of organs all
 across all kinds of life

Speaker 0 :yeah so so basically if you now
 transport that to the sort of humans arrivingin europe and neanderthals are
 everywhere what are you going to do you're going tokill them off you know there's this
 battle for territory and these battle for they're not like uswe have to get rid of them
 so basically there's a you know very interesting mix there but and yetand yet when you look at the genetics
 there's tons of gene flow between them so basically you know love romancebetween you know


Speaker 1 :tribes but love uh uh spans
 uh the gap between the different tribes

Speaker 0 :it's wrong julia it's across species
 boundaries sneaks away from the villageeven before the out of africa there's
 you know within africa's election which was probably massive battles oflarger and larger tribes
 selecting for our social networking and savviness and uh you know probablyall our conspiracy theory
 genes or you know dating back from then and you know it'sso there's a lot of this mischievousness
 in the history of human evolution that unfortunately still present in you knowmany ugly forms today
 but probably contributed to our success as a speciesin wiping out other species it just


Speaker 1 :sucks that uh
 we don't have neighboring species that areyou know intelligent like us
 that but yet very different than us so we have like you know dogs or wolvesi guess
 uh co-evolved they they figured out how to uh neighbor up with humans in afriendly way and collaborate and
 it develop into describing this as if

Speaker 0 :the wolves made a choice
 it's possible that the wolves never had to say that basically humans were justso
 overpowering that they had captive wolvesand then at every generation killed off
 eight of the nine pups and only kept the one that was milder ahhumans it only takes a few generations
 to then sort of have pups that are really mild

Speaker 1 :and so the neanderthals weren't useful


Speaker 0 :in the same way i don't know if it's a
 question of useful they were probably super usefulmy thinking is that they were
 scary that basically something that almost resembles youyeah is something that you try to
 eliminate first it's too close yeah and uh speaking ofum you know species that are intelligent
 and sort of what's left of evolution it is a shameexactly like you say that
 so many different amazing life forms were extinctand the kind of boring ones remained
 so if you look at dinosaurs i mean the diversitythat they had if you look at sub you
 know like there's just so many different lineagesof
 life that were just abruptly killed and yet out of that death emergedyou know many new kinds of really
 awesome lineages do you think there was

Speaker 1 :in the history of
 life on earth species that may be still alive todaythat are more intelligent than humans
 and we just don't know

Speaker 0 :it's also made for dolphins like if you
 look at their brains if you look at the way that they play if you look at theway that they learn
 uh you know i mean they don't have possible thumbs and we doso you know that probably made a big


Speaker 1 :difference it's terrifying to think that
 like not terrifying i don't know how to feelabout it that they're more intelligent
 than us

Speaker 0 :it's like a hitchhiker's guide i know
 but how do you define intelligence basically like i was saying last timeyou know stupid is a stupid does and
 smart is a smart does so yeah if the dolphins are basically supersmart
 figure out the meaning of life and just go around playing with water all daywhich is probably the meaning of life
 then we wouldn't know because all they're doing is kicking water just likesharks are and sharks are probably
 pretty stupid so so basically it's very difficult tosort of
 judge a species intelligence unless you they kind of go out of their way todemonstrate it


Speaker 1 :yeah and that's instructive for our
 understanding of any kind of life form uh you know i recently talked to sarahseeger looking for
 life out there on other planets it'd be fascinating to thinkif we discover a habitable planet that's
 you know outside of earth in one day maybe many centuries away or be able totravel
 with like a robot there how would we actually knowthat this species would probably be able
 to detect that it's a living being but how would we know if it's anintelligent being
 i mean uh it's both exciting and terrifyingto sort of come face to face with a
 life form that's of another world like something that clearly is moving ina um
 how would you say like a deliberate way and to then like ask well how do i askthat thing
 with it whether it's intelligent no but

Speaker 0 :the the question that you're asking is
 um applicable to every species on on the earth on earth nowyeah so basically you know dolphins are
 a great example we know that they're you know clearly capable hardware wiseand behavior-wise
 of intelligence you know how do we communicateso basically if your question is about
 crossing species boundaries of communicationthe way that i want to put it is that
 humans have achieved a level of sophistication in ourbehaviors in our communication in our
 language in our ways of expressing ourselvesthat i have no doubt that if we
 encounter the human-like form of intelligence we'd figure out theirlanguage
 in a few weeks like it'd be just fine as long as you know of coursethey're both trusting each other not
 annihilating each other and not sort of fearing each other and attacking each

Speaker 1 :other what about
 the message just out of curiosity into science fiction land a little bitif so uh clearly you're one of the top
 scientists in the world so if we were to discover an alien lifeform
 uh you would be brought in to study his geneticsdo you think the epigenome that we
 talked about the genome the code the digital code that underliesthat alien life form would be similar to
 ours like the in um in fundamental ways maybenot exactly but
 in fundamental ways of how it's

Speaker 0 :structured yeah so so
 you're getting to the very definition of life you're getting to the verydefinition
 of what what makes life life and how do wedecode that life and it's so easy to
 think that every life form would basically have toyou know like oxygen has to have to like
 heat from the sun and rely on sort of being in the habitable zoneof you know its solar system and so
 forth but i think we have to sort of go beyondthis
 sort of oh life on another planet must be exactly like life is on earthbecause of course life on earth happens
 to rely on the proximity to the sun and benefit from that amount of energybut we're talking at
 time scales of human life where we kind of live i don't knowbetween and i'm going to be super wide
 here we're going we're going to live betweensix earth months and
 you know 200 a month earth months or 200 earth yearsso basically if you look at the time
 scale that we inhabit on earth it is very muchdictated by the amount of energy that we
 receive from the sun if you look at i don't know europa youknow the smallest the fourth smallest
 moon of jupiter the smallest of the galilean moons and also the smallestin its distance from jupiter
 it has an iron core it has a rock exterior it has ice all around itand it has probably massive liquid
 oceans underneath and the gravitational pull thegravitational pull of jupiter
 is probably creating all kinds of movement under that icehow did life evolve on earth yes sure
 life now most of life that we above the surface look at has to do withexploiting the solar energy
 for you know our daily behavior but that's not the case everywhere on theplanet
 if you look at the bottom of the ocean there are hydrothermal ventsthere's both black smokers and white
 smokers and they are near these volcanic uhyou know ducts that basically emanate
 a massive amount of energy from the core of our planetwhat does life need it needs energy does
 it need energy from the sun it couldn't careless does it need energy from
 you know the earth itself yeah possibly it could usethat and if you look at how did life
 evolve on you know on earth there are manytheories
 i mean a kind of silly theory is that it came from outer spacethat basically there's a meteorite out
 there that sort of landed on earth and it brought with itdna material i think it's a little silly
 because it kind of pushes the buck down the roadbasically the next question is how did
 it evolve over there yeah whereas our planet has basically all ofthe right ingredients why wouldn't
 evolve here so basically let's kind of ignore that one and nowthat the two other competing hypotheses
 are from the outside in or from the inside outfrom the outside in means from the
 surface to the bottom of the ocean ah from the inside out means from thebottom of the ocean to the surface
 so life on the surface is pretty brutal life obviously evolved in the waterand then there was an out of water event
 but basically before it exited it was clearly in the water which is amuch nicer and shielded environment


Speaker 1 :so just to be clear on the surface
 are you referring to the the surface of

Speaker 0 :the sea or the bottom of the sea


Speaker 1 :versus the bottom of the sea and you're
 saying life on the surface is uh it's harsh

Speaker 0 :like inside the life outside the water
 is horrible it takes huge amounts of evolutionaryinnovations to sustain


Speaker 1 :living outside the water well that's so
 interesting why why is that so it's easier to life iseasier
 in the water maybe see i'm telling you

Speaker 0 :don't
 water yeah dolphins went back into the water really

Speaker 1 :because dolphins are mammals of course
 yeah interesting well again they might be smarter they

Speaker 0 :went back
 so so if you if you basically think aboutthe fact that we are 70 water we're
 basically transporting the sea with us outside the sea you know if we if wedon't have
 water for about a year 24 hours we're dryyeah and if you look at life under the
 sea i mean i don't know if you're a diverbut when you go diving your brain
 explodes again when i say the light the boringlife forms is what we see all the time
 like tetrapods i mean what a stupid boringbody plan seriously like just go diving
 and you'll see that a tiny little minorityof the stuff under the sea under the
 surface of the sea is actually tetrapods it's like you know snails with all kindsof crazy appendages and colors and
 you know round things and five-way symmetric things and you knoweight-way symmetric things all kinds of
 crazy body plans and only the tetrapod fish managed toget out
 and then they gave rise to all the boring plants we kind of see todayof basically you know uh humans with
 four limbs birds with four limbs lizards with fourlimbs and you know
 right it's kind of boring if you look at by comparisonlife underwater is teeming with
 diversity so now let's roll back the clock andbasically say
 where did life in the ocean come from

Speaker 1 :from the surface
 or from the bottom exactly those two

Speaker 0 :options exactly so basically life on the
 surface is one option and then the idea there isthat
 there's tides with the moon and the sun sort of causing all this movementand this movement is basically causing
 nutrients to sort of you know coalesce and you know bouncearound et cetera that's one option
 the second option massive amount of energy underyou know from from from our the core of
 our planet basically uh exploitedleading to these basic ingredients of
 life forms and what are these basic ingredientsmetabolism
 being able to take energy from the environment and put it as part ofyourself
 metabolism it basically means transformation again in the greekit basically means taking stuff from you
 know like nutrients or energy source oranything and then making it your own
 the second one is compartmentalization if there's no notion ofself there can't be evolution you have
 to know where your own boundaries end and where the non-self boundaries beginand that's basically
 the lipid bilayer nowadays which is extremely simple to to formit's basically just a bunch of lipids
 and then they eventually just self-organize into a membraneso that's a very natural way of forming
 a self and then the third component isreplication
 replication doesn't need to be self-replication it could be ahelps make more of b b helps make more
 of c and c helps make more of a any kind ofself-reinforcement
 is what you need to ignite the process of evolutionafter you've ignited that process you
 know i don't want to say all hell breaks loose but all paradise breaks looseso basically you then boom you know have
 life going and the moment you have abc some kind ofthing
 looping back onto a you can make modificationsand you can improve and then you let
 natural selection work

Speaker 1 :is there some element of that that's
 like co like uh like some state representation thatstores information like
 maybe i should say information absolutely is that talking about the

Speaker 0 :part
 we like to think of life as the information propagation which is dnathe messenger which is rna and then the
 action which is protein so basically dnawe think is an essential part of life
 that's where the storage is and therefore that early life forms musthave had some kind of storage
 medium dna if you look at how life actually evolved dna was invented muchlater
 proteins were invented later and rna was find by itself thank youvery much
 in an rna world so the early version of life as we know it today wasin fact
 rna molecules performing all of the functionsthe rna molecule itself was the
 protein actuator by creating three-dimensional foldsthrough self-hybridization itself what
 self-hybridization so basically the same way that dna moleculescan hybridize with themselves and
 basically form this double helix the single-stranded rna molecule canform
 partial double helixes in various places creating structureas if you had a long string with
 complementary parts and you could then sort of designkind of like origami-like structures
 that will fall down to themselves and then you can make any shape fromthat
 that early rna world eventually got to replication whereenzymes encoded in rna would replicate
 rna itself and then that process basically kicked offevolution
 and that process of evolution then led to major innovationsthe first innovation was translation
 so you start with an rna molecule and you translate it into another kind ofform and that's the first kind of
 encoding you're like well do you need some kind of code yeah butthe code
 was in fact one thing it was conflated with the actuators the actuators wereseparated from the code only later on
 so you first had the self-replicating code which was also the actuatorand then you kind of have a
 functionalization partitioning of the functionalization asub-functionalization
 of the proteins that are now going to be the workhorse of lifebut they're not self-replicating the
 code remains the rna so the most beautiful and most complexrna machine
 known to man is the ribosome the ribosomeis this massive factory that is able to
 translate rna into protein the ribosomeif you if you want i don't know divine
 intervention in the history of life the ribosome is it that's one of the

Speaker 1 :great invention in the history of life


Speaker 0 :it's it's yeah but again you can't think
 of great inventions as one one-time steps they're basically youknow the
 culmination of probably many competing software infrastructures for lifepreservation
 that won out and then when the ribosome was so efficient at making proteinsall the other ones basically died out
 and then the life forms that were using themodern ribosome
 were basically the more successful ones because it could make proteinsand now those proteins are much more
 versatile because rna only has four bases proteinseventually have 20 amino acids not
 initially but eventually and then they can form in much morecomplex shapes and they can create all
 kinds of additional machines one of which is reverse transcriptaseso you basically now have rna again we
 like to think of transcription as the normal reverse transcription as theoddball
 well rna preceded dna so reverse transcription actually was the firstinvention before transcription itself so
 basically rna invents proteins rna and proteinstogether
 invent dna so you now have a more stable mediuma more stable backbone
 with two helices instead of one two strands instead of one the doublehelix and rna basically says
 listen i'm tired i'm gonna delegate all information stories to dnaand i'm going to delegate most actuation


Speaker 1 :to proteins proteins but that's to you
 is not like a that's just an efficiency thing it's nota fundamental


Speaker 0 :new correlation that's why when you're
 asking is a separate information storage mediuma definition of life like no any kind of
 self preservation self reinforcement and itdidn't need to be
 rna rna-based initially it didn't need to be self-replicationinitially you just need to have enough
 rna molecules randomly arising that reinforce eachother
 that ultimately lead to the you know the closing of that loop andthe ignition of the evolutionary process


Speaker 1 :can we just rewind a little bit like if
 you were to bet all your money on the two optionsin terms of where life started probably
 the bottom at the bottom though i don't know ifthis is answerable but
 how hard is the first step or if there's something interesting youcan say about that first leap
 yeah yeah yeah about from not from not

Speaker 0 :life to life
 yeah i think it's inevitable

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :on earth or just in the universe i think
 it's inevitable if you look at europa you know goingback to
 the the moon of jupiter it's also a

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :really nice song by santana
 basically has all the ingredients it has you know the core that can emit energyit has the shielding through the ice
 sheet protecting it just like an atmospherewould it even has a layer of oxygen
 probably sufficiently dense to sustain life somy guess is that there's probably
 uh independently a reason life form already teeming in europabecause as soon as it


Speaker 1 :today is that exciting or terrifying to


Speaker 0 :you
 it's i mean as a scientist i can't wait to seenon-dna based life forms i can't wait
 because we are so born uhin in you know sort of uh borne
 as i would say in french but basically we're sort of you knowwe we we are so narrow-minded in our
 thinking of what life should look like that ican't wait for all that to just be blown
 away by the discovery of life elsewhere let

Speaker 1 :me bring you into another science
 fiction uh it's a scenario so on that pointif we discover life on europa
 and you were brought in you seem very excited buthow would you start looking at that life
 in a way that's useful to you as a scientistbut also not going to kill all of us
 so like to me it's a little bit scary because not not because it's amalevolent life like it's a
 it's a dictator petting like a cat it's evilbut just the way life is it seems to be
 very good at conquering other life so there's a

Speaker 0 :lot of science fiction movies based on
 that principle yeah and that's sort of what causes thepublic to be so scared but if you think
 about sort of would europa life be scared of humanscoming over and taking over
 chances are no not even like earth bacteria because earth bacteria would bewiped out
 in an instant in this foreign world because they don't know how tometabolize
 energy that doesn't come from the types of energy sources that are herethe levels of acidity may just kill us
 all off and at the same way in this in in theconverse way
 if you bring life from europa on earth it'll die instantly because it's too hotor because it doesn't need to know how
 to cope with i don't know the sun's radiation soclose to this completely inhabitable
 zone by their standards so so what we callthe habitable zone
 might actually be the inhabitants for

Speaker 1 :them so the difference
 if the environments are sufficiently different you think we'll justnot be able to even attack each other
 and a basic

Speaker 0 :uh it'll take massive amounts of
 engineering to create machines that will go there and samplethe you know oceans basically drill
 through the layers of ice to basically sampleand see
 what life is like there and detecting it will probably be trivial it definitelywon't be dna based it's not like we're
 going to send a sequencer but it'll be you know some other kind ofcombination of chemicals that will look
 non-random

Speaker 1 :so if you had to bet if i took that life
 form we find on europa and like put it on a sandwichthat you're eating and like eat that
 sandwich it'll taste just fine and you'll be well

Speaker 0 :i
 don't know about that i don't know

Speaker 1 :anyone well it tastes fine that's
 interesting so

Speaker 0 :the other question is do we have taste
 receptors for this adaptations to chemical molecules thatwe are used to seeing
 so you think we don't have case bugs for things we don't even know about wow sowe won't yeah we want to be able to know
 that this chemical tastes funny

Speaker 1 :but you think it won't be it's likely
 not to be dangerous like it won't know how to even interruptdo you think our immune system will
 will even detect that something weird is

Speaker 0 :probably
 and it'll be very easy to detect because it'll be very different from very weirdbut it won't be able to sort of
 attack i mean the scene from i don't know independence daywhere like they're communicating with
 the other computer and they're like ooh i'm ini mean it's hilarious because like macs
 and pcs have trouble communicating i mean let alone an alien technology oreven alien dna


Speaker 1 :so okay uh now i was talking about you
 being a scientist on earth but say you were a scientist uh they wereshipped over to europa
 to investigate if there's life what would you look forin terms of signs of life


Speaker 0 :life is unmistakable i would say
 the way that life transforms a planet surrounding itis not the kind of thing that you would
 expect from the physical laws alone so it'si would say that as soon as life
 arises it creates this compartmentalizationit starts pushing things away it starts
 sort of keeping things inside that herselfand there's a whole signature
 that you can see from that so when i was organizing my meaning of life symposiummy my my friend was an astrophysicist um
 basically uh we were deciding on what would be the themesfor the for the symposium and then uh i
 said well we're going to have biology we're going to have physics and she'slike
 come on biology is just a small part of physics[Laughter]
 everything is a small part of physics and uh i meanin in many ways it is but my immediate
 answer was no no wait life challenges physics it supersedesphysics
 it sort of fights against physics and that's what i would look for ineuropa i would basically look for this
 fight against physics for anything that sort ofsignatures of not just entropy at work
 not just things diffusing away not just gravitational pulls butclear signatures of you remember when i
 was talking earlier about this whole selection for environment selection forbiospheres for ecosystems
 for this multi-organism form of life and i think that's sort of thethe first thing that you can look for
 you know chemical signatures that are not simply predictedfrom the reactions you would get


Speaker 1 :randomly such a beautiful
 way to look at life so you're basically leveraging some energy sourceto enable you to resist the physics of
 the universe

Speaker 0 :fighting against physics but that's
 that's the first transformation if you look at humanswe're way past that what do you mean by


Speaker 1 :transformation so so


Speaker 0 :basically there's there's layers i sort
 of see life you know when we talk about themeaning of life
 life can be construed at many levels we talked aboutlife in the simplest form of sort of the
 ignition of evolution and that's sort of thebasic definition that you can check off
 yes it's alive but when alexander the greatwas asked to whom do you owe
 your life to your teachers or to your parents and alexander thegreat
 uh answered i owe to my parents the zine the life itself and i owe to myteachers the
 f zine like euphony f means good the opposite of cacophony which meansyou know bad
 so f zine in his uh words was basically livinga human life a proper life so basically
 we can go from the zine to the f-zine and that transformation has takenseveral additional leaps so basically
 you know life on europa i'm pretty sure has gotten to the stage ofa makes b makes c makes a again
 but getting to the f zine is a whole otherlevel and that level requires
 cooperation that level requires altruism that level requiresspecialization
 remember how we're talking about the rna specializing into dna for storageproteins and then compartmentalizations
 and if you look at prokaryotic life there's no nucleusit's all one soup of things
 intermingling if you look at eukaryotic life again you for truegood you know so a eukaryote
 basically has a nucleus and that's where you compartmentalize furtherthe organization of the information
 storage from all of the daily activities if youlook at a you know human body plan or
 any animal you have a comparablization of thegermline you basically have
 one lineage that will basically be saved for the future generationsand everything outside that lineage is
 almost superfluous if you think about it the rest of yourbody all it does
 is ensure that that lineage will make it to the next generationthat these germ lines will make to the
 next generation the rest is packaging i'm sorry to be so blunt yeah and if youlook at nutrition
 you know where deterostomes what does the stone meandertero means second where
 this is the second mouth the first mouth is actually down here is the esophagusso dirt or stones have evolved a second
 layer of eating kind of like alien with the two mouthsyeah so you can think of us as alien
 where the first mouth is up here and then the second mouth is down there

Speaker 1 :is of course is the first mouth just the
 the the physical manipulation of the food to make it more correct

Speaker 0 :correct and basically again you know if
 you look at if you look at a worm it's an extremely simple life form itbasically has a mouth it has an anus
 and it has you know just some organs in between that consume the food and justspit spit out poo
 humans are basically a fancy form of thatso you basically have the mouth you have
 the digestive tract and then you have limbs to get better atgetting food you have
 eyesight hearing etc to get better getting foodyeah and then you have of course the
 germline and all of this food part it's just auxiliary to their germline soyou basically have layers of
 addition of comparablization of specializationon top of this zine to get all the way
 to the earth scene

Speaker 1 :yeah so like the warm is like windows 95
 very few features very basic and then us humans are likewindows vista or windows 10 whatever it
 is

Speaker 0 :well a few innovations beyond that but
 yeah and then all right where i don't know where windows 3000 atleast is such a fascinating way to look


Speaker 1 :at life as a set of transformations
 exactly so like is there some interesting transformations to ourhistory here on earth that like appeal
 to you of course so and what are the most brilliantinnovations and transformations yeah


Speaker 0 :yeah yeah i mean this is such a
 fascinating question of course like you know we're talking about basicbasic life forms and we'll talk about
 eukaryotic life forms and then the next big transformation ismulticellular life forms
 where the specialization separates the germ linefrom everything else that accompanies it
 and sort of carries it and then that specialization then sortof has this
 massive new innovation like above the second mouthwhich is this massive brain and this
 massive brain is basically something that arisesmuch much later on basically you know
 notochords like having the first spinal cordthis whole concept that along with the
 this very simple layers you basically now have acoordinating agent
 and this coordinating agent is starting to make decisionsand remember when we're talking about uh
 free will i mean you know as a worm is hunting forfood
 oh it has plenty of free will it can choose to you knowfollow chemotaxis to the left for
 chemotaxis to the right and maybe that's free will because it's unpredictablebeyond a certain level so you basically
 now have more and more decision making andcoordination of all of these different
 body parts and organs by a central operating system a centralmachine that basically will control
 the rest of the body and the other thing that ilove talking about is the different time
 scales at which things happen you know we're talking about the humanepi genome before the human epigenome is
 basically able to find what genes should be expressed inresponse to environmental stimuli
 in the order of minutes and basically receive a stimulustransfer all that data through this
 humongously long string of searching and then sort of find whatgenes to turn on
 and then create all that all of that is happening in the time scale ofminutes basically you know three minutes
 to a to half an hour that's the expression response but ourdaily life doesn't happen on the order
 of three minutes to half an hour it happens on the order ofmilliseconds like i throw a ball at you
 you catch it right away no gene expression changes there youjust don't have time to do that
 so you basically have a layer of control built on a hardware that supports itbut that hardware itself lives in a
 different time scale than the controlling machine on top of

Speaker 1 :that is that an accident by the way is
 that like a feature is it was it possible for life to have evolvedwhere
 the our the daily life of the organism as it interacts with its environmentwas on time scale similar to uh
 the the way our internals work if you

Speaker 0 :look at
 trees they look kind of boring and stupid you're like looking at a treelike stupid if you speed up the movie of
 a tree from spring until october you'll be likeoh my god it's intelligent
 and the reason for that is that at that time scalethe tree is basically saying oh i'm
 looking for a you know a thing to catch on to oh i just caught onto that i'm going to grow more here i'm
 going to spawn there etc like i can see the trees in my gardenjust growing and sort of you know
 looping around and um it's all a matter of time scaleand if you look at the human time scale
 remember we were talking about neoteny the last time aroundthe whole fact that our young are pretty
 useless until you know maybe you know a fewmonths of age if not a few years of age
 if not i don't know getting out of collegeand then we we basically hold them
 enabling their brain to continue being malleableand infusing it with knowledge and you
 know thoughts as you know that period of neotimiincreases and expands
 if you fast forward i don't know another million yearsso humans have only been around you know
 different from apes for about that long jump another unit of that another humangym divergence
 what could happen from an evolutionary time scale a lot one of the thingsthat's happening already
 is expansion of human lifespan we have longer and longer periods before wemature
 and we have longer and longer periods because before we have babiesso intergenerational distance is you
 know grown from i don't know 16 years to 40 years you're saying that's in the

Speaker 1 :genetics like


Speaker 0 :no no not necessarily but but it's it's
 sort of an environmental tendency that's happeningbut as we medically expand
 human lifespan the generations might actually be pushedinstead of 40 years
 to 60 years to 100 years if we look at

Speaker 1 :the long arc


Speaker 0 :of the evolutionary history exactly so
 as we start thinking about intergalactic travel nowi'm sorry that's that's a heck of a


Speaker 1 :transition
 uh yeah so let's talk about it no no no

Speaker 0 :no no as as we
 as a species start thinking about i mean i'm talking about these transitions thatare happening right now and that's
 that's so awesome continuing along thesetransitions what does the future hold in
 the next million years so the concept of us going to anotherplanet
 and that taking three human lifetimes might be a jokeif the human lifetime starts being 400
 years or 800 years so imaginethis time scale it's all time scale just
 different time skills yeah you asked me offline whether i wouldlike to live forever i mean
 my answer is absolutely and there's many different types offorevers one forever
 is do i want to live today forever kind of like groundhog day andthe answer is
 absolutely the stuff that i want to learn today will probably take alifetime
 just to learn you know basically to clear my to-do list for the day

Speaker 1 :you mean like relive the day of the day
 and then and then pick up different things from the richness of theexperiences


Speaker 0 :there's just so much happening in the
 world every single day so much knowledge that has happened alreadythat just to catch up on that will
 probably take me around forever

Speaker 1 :and that on that point i just i would
 just love to see you in the groundhog moviejust because you're so
 naturally as a scientist but just the way your mind works beautifullyjust all the richness of the experiences
 that you would pick up from that uh that's a beautiful visual but you

Speaker 0 :just try to live each day as if it was
 groundhog i'm basically every single day waking upand saying all right how would bill
 murray get out of that one well you know what

Speaker 1 :on uh
 on a funny tangent like i got a chance to uhgo to a neural link demonstration event
 i'm not usually familiar with neurolink and uh i talked to elon for a while uhand one of the funny things he said on
 this groundhog day thing is you know it's a beautifuldream to
 eventually be able to replay our memories so we'rekind of these recording machines our
 brain is kind of uh maybe a noisy recording machine ofmemories
 and it would be beautiful if we can someday in the future maybe far into thefuture
 be able to like in the groundhog day situation replay thatand the funny comment that stuck with me
 is he said that maybe this our conversation now is areplay
 of a member of a previous memory and that stuck with me becauseit would probably be my replay you know
 who the hell am i i'm just some idiot guy but like elon musk is you knowprobably because of spacex and so on is
 probably going to be remembered as a special personone of our special apes in history
 so if i wanted to replay memory probably be that one you know talking to elon fora while yeah
 that's an interesting uh possibility from uhif we think about time scales if we
 think about the richness of the experience throughtime
 that we humans take and be able to replace some aspects of that of thatbiology that's
 super interesting but anyway sorry sorry for the tangent let'syeah you were talking about time scales
 and the expansion of the human lifetime and uh

Speaker 0 :the intergalactic travel yeah no but but
 you're laughing about this yeah for sure that is you're talkingabout this you're talking about
 exploring alien worlds yeah and going to other planets i meanyou know when sarah was here she was
 talking about sort of going to other planetswhen we find these life i mean i'm just
 very naturally given the topics that we've approachedtalking about the the time scale at
 which this will happen

Speaker 1 :so i think eventually we will human or
 life life will expand out into the universe

Speaker 0 :the the point that i'm trying to make is
 that in intergalactic species we'll probably find ways to engineer itsbiology
 in order to expand the way that we experiencetime expand the the time skills that we
 experienced and going back to this whole concept ofyou know would i like to live forever
 yes i'd like to live forever even if it was even if i was stuck on the same dayi'd love to live forever because i would
 finally have time to do all these things that i want to dobut if living forever actually comes
 with a perk of watching the whole world evolveforever i mean
 that's a huge perk and i would you know just it'll never get boringjust an ever-changing world and then the
 mind uh you know sort of experiment that i wantyou to to do
 is to also ask what if i wanted to live foreverone day at a time every year
 or one day at a time every decade would you choose thatwhere you would wake up and the world
 would be 10 years later every single day you wake up it's theopposite of groundhog day
 where basically you always wake up and it's always 10 years later

Speaker 1 :so you're saying that's such a powerful
 interesting concept that life is more interesting if you're of all thelife forms on earth
 that you're the slowest one exactly

Speaker 0 :exactly like trees
 like you know they've been there since the minoan civilization yeah and youknow that takes us back to the the
 question you asked about sort of the transformations that have happenedin humanity the minoan civilization is
 one of them you know there's this paper that waspublished just a couple of years ago by
 one of my friends that basically looked at theuh genetic makeup of the minoans
 and the messinians in ancient greek in ancient greece and how they relate tomodern greeks
 and they found that indeed there was very little gene flowfrom you know the outside and
 you know it's it's fantastic to sort of think about these amazing civilizationsthat transformed the way that human
 thought happens that basically looked for rulesin nature that looked for principles
 that looked for the standards of beauty not human beautybut beauty in the natural world
 this whole concept that the world must be elegantand there must be deeper ways of
 understanding that world to me that's a massive transformation ofour species
 similar to you know the earlier transformation we were talking about ofeven involving a brain
 of you know learning how to communicate languageor the evolution of eyesight if you look
 at sort of you know we're talking about these wormscrawling around and then sensing which
 direction are the chemicals more abundantyou know chemotaxis so eventually
 they grow a nose eventually they grow uh i mean when i say nose i meanways of sensing chemicals that's
 probably one of the earliest senses you know we always talk about how deeprooted is in your brain that's one of
 the earliest senses if you look at hearing that's a muchlater sense if you look at eyesight
 that's an intermediate sense where you're basically sensing where the lightdirection comes from
 that's probably something that life didn't mean until it got you know intothe surface
 and so on and so forth so there's a lot ofyou know milestones and i was talking
 about the latest milestone which is ligo last time of being able to detectgravitational waves
 and sort of being able to sort of have a sense that humans haven't had

Speaker 1 :before so you see that as a yet another
 transformation it gives us an extra little sound of

Speaker 0 :course and now if you go back to this
 history of ancient greece i mean this this transformation thathappened i mean of course
 the egyptians had this incredible you know civilization for thousands of yearsbut what happened in greece was this
 whole concept of let's break things down and understand the natural worldlet's break things down and understand
 physics let's basically build rules around architectureabout around elegance around you know
 statues and tragedy i mean another question thatyou asked me in passing
 was this whole concept of embracing the good and the badembracing your the full range of human
 emotions and if you look at greek tragedy it'sthe definition of that
 it's i mean drama i mean again it's a greek wordbut but the whole concept of some
 problems that are just so vast and large that dying is the easy way outthe death oh that's the easy solution
 you know so so i want to touch a little bit on thatpoint and and um
 sort of talk about this concept that life supersedes physicsand that the brain supersedes life
 that basically we have a brain that can decideto not follow evolution's path we can
 decide to not have children we can decide to not eat we can decideto suicide
 we can decide to sort of abolish communication with the outside worldi mean all the things that make us human
 we can basically decide not to do that and that that isbasically when
 the brain itself is basically supersedingwhat evolution program is for so


Speaker 1 :okay so one of the it's okay my mind was
 already blown at the beautiful formulation of the ideathat
 life is uh is a system that

Speaker 0 :resists physics yeah and


Speaker 1 :our brain or perhaps the content of it
 or however maybe functionally our brainis a thing that resists life yes


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yes you're so
 you're so brilliant but but

Speaker 0 :but but i want you to see all of that as
 a continuum basically you're sort of talking aboutthe sort of individual transformations
 but it's a path yeah that that humanity has a transformationit's a path of transformation and then i
 want us to think about what it truly means to becomehuman like the
 f zine and you asked me about what motivated my meaning of life symposiumwhat motivated it in part i mean of
 course it was an inside joke of turning 42but what motivated him in part was
 actually a mid-life crisis so the joke that i always like to say ischris papadimitriou a famous greek
 professor who was previously at mit at harvard atstanford berkeley everywhere
 uh brilliant brilliant person that's actually costis advisoryeah uh so so christopher means really
 likes to say that when you're an undergrad you work like arat to get into grad school
 and where you grasp you work like a rat to get your phdand where you're post doc you work like
 a rat to get your assistant professors in jailand where is this profession you work
 like a rat to become a full professor and then when you're a full professorwell by then you're basically a rat
 that's brilliant so basically what happened to me is thati arrived at the end of the rat race
 yeah you know life is a rat race you constantly havehurdles to jump over you constantly have
 tunnels and secret pathways and i figured it all out and eventuallyas i was turning 42
 i looked back and i was like wow that was an awesome rat racebut i'm not a rat i basically got out of
 the labyrinth and i was like i'm not i'm not a rat turns out is that

Speaker 1 :the first moment where you saw
 that it's that you were in a rat race it

Speaker 0 :no no i've known that i'm in a rat race
 for a long time it's so easy to be in a rat race it's so easy to be anundergraduate because you have problem
 sets and you know we're all smart people you knowproblem set it has a solution somebody
 made it for you you can just solve it everything was made as a test and youkeep passing those tests and tests and
 tests and tests and you have tasks that are well definedthe phd is a little different
 because it's more open-ended but yet you have an advisor who's guiding youand then you become a professor and
 tenure is a well-set defined set of tasks andyou do all that
 and at 42 i basically had bought a house three kids beautiful wife tenureyeah awesome students tons of grants
 life was basically laid out for me and that's when i had mymain life crisis that's when people
 usually buy a harley davidson [Applause]and they basically say oh i need
 something new i need something different and to be young myself etcbut basically that was my realization
 that it's not a rat race that there's no rat race it's over thati have to basically think how do i fully
 instantiate myself how do i complete my transformation into anactual human being
 because it's very easy to sort of forget all the intangibles of lifeit's very hard to just sort of think
 about the next task and the next ask and it's all metrics and you know what's thenumber of viewers i have what is the
 number of you know publications i have what's the number of citationsthe number of talks the number of grants
 it's very easy to quantify everything and then at some point you're like thisis real life
 it's not a test anymore and that's something that i told my wifeearly on i was like no no
 our life is not going to be let's put the kids through collegeand that you know maybe that's when i
 escaped the rat race maybe it continued being a rat race maybe the next stepwould have been
 all right how do i make sure that my kid is first in class how do i make surethat they're you know into the great
 greatest callers and then you know they're into collegeand then you're like 60.


Speaker 1 :so how do you how do you escape but what
 is uh uh

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :is is there a light at the end of the
 tunnel of a midlife crisis

Speaker 0 :so so you should watch that symposium
 because the videos were transformative to meand to many others so basically the
 advice that i received from all of my friends wasso meaningful this you know there's some
 some advice that basically says you have to constantly maintainunachievable goals
 goals that you can make progress towards but you can never be fully done withand i think that's almost playing into
 the sort of rat race thing like basically make sure that there's moreobstacles for your little
 rant persona to jump through so that's one possibility so first ofall


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :watch is it available it's on youtube
 just google it google really meaning of licensing i'veknown this and you should have told me
 this like this is awesome

Speaker 1 :okay yeah this is great but and also
 like you know saying rat race is uhyou know if you look at ratatouille it's


Speaker 0 :not
 i mean that's a beautiful that's a

Speaker 1 :beautiful thing
 of challenges and overcoming child that could befundamentally the meaning of life is
 uh to see life as a set of challenges and to fullyengage in the overcoming of those
 challenges

Speaker 0 :i would say that that's embracing the
 rat race view of life so so a joke that we like to have withmy wife all the time is
 we basically say we we pretend that we're in this all-inclusive resortthat we've basically hired all these
 people to go on the esplanade and play games because we enjoy watching peopleplaying on the esplanade and
 we enjoy sort of laying and looking at life and all the people biking androllerblading and all that
 and then we've paid all these people in this all-inclusive resort that we livein
 and then uh what are we going to do today i'm like oh i've signed up forprofessor activities
 it's going to be awesome they they lined up a bunch of super smart mit studentsfor me to meet with i'm gonna have a
 grant writing meeting afterwards it's gonna beawesome and then she signed up for a
 bunch of consulting activities it's gonna be greatand then in the evening we just get back
 together and say hey how was your consulting today so in a way that'sanother view of life of basically
 wait a minute if i was a gazillionaire what would i choose to doi would probably pay an awesome
 university to give me an office there and justpay a bunch of super smart people to
 work with me even though they don't really want toetc etc in fact i would have exactly the
 life that i have now working my butt off every single daybecause it's so freaking fulfilling well
 that's so let's clarify this is a

Speaker 1 :beautiful way it's almost like a video
 game view of life that it's a set of i mean again game isnot
 perhaps a positive term but it's a it's a it is a beautiful time so youyou do do you or do you not like the
 rat race view of life no

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :because it is fulfilling in some the


Speaker 0 :right race is about the goal
 my view of life is about the path so againquote in greece those folks have


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :come up with some good stuff so this um
 basically wrote this uh beautiful poem about sort of going throughlife saying as you go through your
 journey impersonating ulysses of his voyagehe says wish that the path is long
 and arduous because when you get to ithaca you might realizethat it was all about the path not the
 destination and so the rat rate view of life makesit all about the destination it's like
 how do i get through the maze to get therebut the all-inclusive resort view of
 life is about the path it's about wowtoday i couldn't wish for a better set
 of activities all programmed for me to enjoyhaving my brain having my body having my
 senses and you know the life that i have soit's a very different kind of view
 it's focused on the journey not on the destination so we

Speaker 1 :you mentioned kind of the ups and downs
 of life and the midlife crisis and right now yousaid
 focusing kind of on the journey but what the journey involvesis ups and downs is there


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :uh advice or any kind of thoughts
 that you can elucidate about the downs in your life yeah the hard parts of yourlife and
 how you got out or maybe not or is there yeah how do you see the dark parts of

Speaker 0 :life
 so i i'm so glad you're asking this question because it's something that oursociety does a terrible
 job at preparing us for every hollywood moviehas to have a happy ending it is
 ridiculous you can count on your ten fingersthe number of bad ending movies that
 you've ever watched and you probably wouldn't need all 10fingers
 we strive to tell everyone yes you can succeed yesyou're a millionaire just temporarily
 disabled and yes you know uhthe prince will eventually figure out
 his princess and they will have a happily ever after ending andyes the hero will be beaten and beaten
 and beaten but you know that at the end of the movie the googly eyes will winwe need more movies where the bad guys
 win we need more movies where just everybody dieswe're just you know a macgyver doesn't
 figure out how to disable the bomb and it just explodesyou just you just need more movies that
 are more realistic about the fact that life kind of sucks sometimes and it'sokay
 so again growing up in greece i i have been exposed to songsthat are not just sad but they're
 miserable miserable so so one of them one of them comes tomind
 and and it's it's basically talking about this womanwho's lamenting in the early morning
 about losing the joyful kid the joyful young man who basically diedin the civil war in the arms
 of our own fellow citizens and she's like if only he had diedfighting the foreign forces if only he
 had died at the you know sides of the you knowgeneral if only he had died with honor
 i would be proud to have lost the joyful kidi mean it's devastating right it's like
 he didn't just die he died without honoryeah and and i my friend who was with me
 was listening to the song and she's like this is depressing i'm likeyou have to listen to another one it's
 not as sad and she's like what this one died with honorso so that's one example it's a kind of


Speaker 1 :a celebration
 of uh misery no no no no no no so let me

Speaker 0 :give you a couple more examples and and
 then i'll answer that question so another example is i i picked up thisbook that i had from my childhood
 and i started reading stories to my kids and the first storyis about these two children one is
 really poor living on the street and the other one is really rich livingin the house and the bright light above
 and the poor one is wishing looking at that window and wishing that you couldhave that house
 and the other one is at the window wishing that he was free that he wasn'tsick all the time that you could escape
 outside it's only four pages long and at the endboth children die
 one of them dies from cold the other one dies from illnessand you're like how is that even a
 children's story the next story i'm like okay that's finelet's skip this one let's you know so i
 read this to my kids and then i read the next one and the next one isabout this this woman
 whose brother is at war against the turksand he is
 gonna die and she prays to the virgin please don't let him die and the virginappears and she's like
 no problem tell me who to kill instead and she's like anyone anyone no no nochoose one
 how about this turk this one has two kidsa beautiful family waiting for him at
 home she's like no not this one choose another oneand then she goes through all the life
 stories of the other and since he's like no nojust don't take anyone he's like i can't
 do that i can you can choose to bring yourbrother back and he will be depressed
 for the rest of his life because he didn't fight at warbecause he didn't go to that battle and
 he will live without her she's like and in the end the woman decides to haveher brother killed instead
 because he dies with her i mean this is insaneso so why am i giving you these examples
 it's not a glorification of misery it's a it's expand your emotional rangeit's teaching you that and and when i
 read these stories i'm not i'm not a jerk i'm crying outloud
 i have tears and i like my face becomes redfrom the the the pain that i'm
 experiencing through these stories it's just so deeply touchingto embrace the
 suffering not because of an accident but because of a choicethe sacrifice to embrace the fact that
 not everything is cute and rosy and always ending welland i think that we don't do a good
 enough job of teaching our kids that just lifesucks and life is unfair sometimes and
 that's and that's okay and sometimes i read a story to my kidsi read a story every night
 and sometimes the story is horrible and sometimes the story is good and andsort of friendly and happy
 and my kids always ask what's the moral of the storyand sometimes those are moral and it's
 like oh you should be good or you should benice you should be helping each other et
 cetera and sometimes it's just no moral and i tell my kids you know whatsometimes just life doesn't make sense
 and it's okay and you can't comprehend everything andi think this concept
 of how do you deal with bad days comes from the fact that we're taughtwe're brainwashed into thinking that
 every day should be a happy day and we're not ready to cope with miseryand the other thing that crying through
 these stories teaches you is that you don't have itnearly half as bad as you think
 do you see do you see what i mean basically it tells you that i meanmy mom would always tell me about how
 she was transformed as a teenager when she volunteeredin the hospital and she saw all these
 people at the brink of death clinging for lifeand
 helping them out to be as she could and cryingher her heart out when they were dying
 and sort of how that taught her the appreciationfor what we have every day waking up
 every morning and saying my life doesn't suck my life is notnearly half as bad as it could be
 and and sort of embracing the joy that we have of living where we livein the moment we live and i'm gonna go
 further if you look at the arc of humanum life the you know human existence
 through the centuries there's no better way to be alive than nowi mean we're complaining about every
 single little thing but life expectancy is at an all-timehigh
 sickness all-time low poorness misery all-time low there's no bettertime to be alive
 globally across all of human existence number onenumber two here in boston there's no
 better place to be alive if you think about the amalgamation ofscience
 engineering technology the ridiculously awesome people you're bringing everyweek to your podcast
 i mean this is the ancient greece of modern society

Speaker 1 :but the weather still sucks because no


Speaker 0 :let me put it this way the weather gives
 us a range of emotion the full range the fullscenic pattern


Speaker 1 :that's such a fascinating thing about
 human psychology i've i often reread this book i'm not sure if you'refamiliar with this
 man's search for meaning by viktor frankland uh he talks
 about you know his uh living through the holocaust and in theconcentration camps
 and even there where there's like human miseryis at its uh highest even
 there he discovers these moments by observing the suffering by acceptingthe suffering
 he uh he observes moments of true joy of how great his life isrelative to others at the camp
 uh who have it worse yeah so so

Speaker 0 :it's it's a dangerous liberty slope to
 think that way because it's basically being better than jones'sand if you know if
 the the house next door has a giant car then you want to get a bigger car orsomething like that
 it's not comparative misery i think the way that i see it is slightlydifferent it's
 and it's not even thinking about all the worst possible outcomesthat could have happened but didn't the
 the example as you were talking about the concentration camps the mosthorrible
 i mean one of the most horrible moments of human existence i was thinking aboutpictures that i was seeing of kids in
 syria in war-torn zones and you're looking atthese kids
 and again i cried out loud imagining my own son in thevan after a bomb explosion
 watching his you know father die or his siblings die or losing his friends it'ssomething that we are not
 capable of fathoming but if you actually put a seven-year-old in that situationthe look that i saw in these kids eyes
 basically said it is what it is it was it wasand and i've experienced that with my
 own kid when he gets like my my my three-year-old last liketwo years ago
 who's not my five-year-old uh she was burnedreally badly with like hot chocolate and
 coffee that just peeled off her skin so you couldactually see just her fragile skin had
 just peeled off and she was the happiest little kidshe was just going along with the
 punches it is what it is it is she accepted it so soto sort of realize that
 children don't say oh i could have it betterthey they sort of
 embrace the moment not embrace but sort of accept the momentand then they can have moments of pure
 joy in a horrendous war-torn countryand you know like so many people from
 you know these war torn countries basically say oh youthink
 you americans are going to just come and just send us a bunch of aid and food etcyeah sure that's helpful but what do we
 dream of what do we struggle for we struggle for love we struggle formeaning
 we struggle for you know emotions and friendships we struggle for the samethings you guys struggle for
 we're not just like every day waking up and saying oh i wish i had more foodno that's just a given i just don't have
 enough food but what we struggle with are basically everything else and thatsort of gives you some perspective
 on life it basically says you know and another story that my mom told me when iwas a kid is this story about sort of
 this man who's basically you know see he seesthe christ up here in front of him and
 he says oh christ i'm carrying all these problems i'm carrying this bigbag
 can you please take it from me and he's like sure let me just give you any otherbag
 and basically you know the person in the end except his own bagso acceptance


Speaker 1 :ultimately recommended acceptance


Speaker 0 :every single other bag is probably worse
 it's the evil you don't know versus the evil you know like we allstruggle with our own problems
 but if you look at the bigger picture it's just your path through life and ifyou embrace it
 the good and the bad every single day it's just joyelation sadness
 misery if you don't have both you're not a complete human beingyou know you can't i mean the last
 example i'm going to give is the movie um inside out by pixarbeautiful movie which one is that the
 one with the little characters controlling

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :all the emotions so you basically have
 joy and sadness and fear and disgust etcand the moral of the story if you
 remember the movie the moral of the storyis that in the end joy is basically
 trying to fix everything to make everything happyand she's failing miserably and
 everything else is like crumbling and falling apartand the little girl basically becomes
 emotionless because all she knows how to do is fake happinessand i think it's a very good analogy for
 our everyday society where we're always saying are you happyare you happy my mom calls me and she's
 like manolas are you happy i'm like mom stop asking this stupid question no i'mnot happy
 yeah what you should be asking is if i'm fulfilled yeah and that's a verydifferent thing i don't go around being
 happy i wouldn't love it if your mom called

Speaker 1 :and said
 manolas are you suffering beautifully

Speaker 0 :that's exactly right that's what she
 should be asking are you are you struggling to achievesomething great
 yeah that's the question that your mom should be asking not only did that mom

Speaker 1 :call me about the suffering not about
 how good uh how good are you doing so what i tell

Speaker 0 :her is that life is not about maximizing
 happiness life is about accomplishing somethingmeaningful
 and accomplishing that meaningful thing cannot come froma series of joyful moments it comes from
 a series of struggles of successes and failuresof people being nasty to you and people
 being nice to you and embracing the full thing and if yousupersede
 that constant need for gratification if yousupersede that constant need for
 kindness you suddenly know you who you areand what i like to say to my kid and my
 son the other day was telling me oh so-and-so called me such and such andi'm like
 are you such and such he's like no i'm like ha hasee they were wrong and what i tell him
 is if you know who you are what other people say about you onlyteaches you
 about them yeah so it has no influence on yourself-esteem
 if you know where you stand you embrace the good but you also embrace the badi have plenty of bad and i'm embracing
 it i'm a procrastinator how do i deal withthat
 i trick myself into procrastinating about mindless stupid littleday-to-day things and in that
 procrastination time doing important things for the future

Speaker 1 :so accepting who you are accepting your


Speaker 0 :flaws accepting the whole of it


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :accepting the struggle accepting the
 sleeplessness accepting the fact that the journey iswhat matters
 hoping that your path to ithaca is full of troublesbecause those troubles are the life you
 will lead accepting that life will not startafter the next milestone that life has
 already started a long time ago and what you're experiencing now is thelife
 this is it it's not some kind of future thing that you work yourself hard to getto
 and then after that you'll live hyperello happily ever afterto me the happily ever after that's the
 end of the story nothing happens after thatthey struggled and the struggle and the
 struggle is much more interesting story thanthey lived happily ever after so i think
 we have to embrace that as a as a society that it's not just about thehappy ending that our kids
 are brainwashed into expecting that things will be happy and rosy and it'sokay if they're not
 and they should keep struggling because the struggle is the journey and thejourney
 is the meaning of life it's not the end it's the journey

Speaker 1 :what about accepting one of the harder
 things we talked a little bit about immortalitywhat about accepting that life ends
 so do you monoliths think about your own mortalityhow we talked about accepting that
 there's ups and downs to life what about the ultimate down which isthe finality of it do you think about
 that do you fear it you also ask me

Speaker 0 :if i'm afraid of getting older
 yes and that's on the path to mortality so let me talk about thatfirst step and then the last step
 literally the last step so getting older what doesthat mean
 when i was 18 when i was 20 my brain i felt was at my maximum i was likenothing
 is impossible i can solve anything i could takeany math puzzle any logic puzzle any
 programming puzzle and to solve it in millisecondsi just saw the answer through problems i
 was like feeling invincible i would show up at lecture with mynewspaper
 lift up my head every now and then point to errors justbrat complete brat i would raise my hand
 and correct my professors from the whole classroomtotal brand i have some of those in my
 class now and it's awesome it's like veryhuge i used to be you teaching you
 humility yeah so um so so so i felt invincibleand i was like this is it this is
 awesome i'm living the life 10 years later my brain didn't work thesame way
 i wasn't as good at the tiny little puzzlesbut it worked in different ways and
 right now 20 years later it works in yet differentways
 and oh gosh i love the journey

Speaker 1 :can you maybe give some hints of the
 interesting different ways that your brain works asit aged


Speaker 0 :yeah i went from the phase of sheer
 speed and hardcore quantitative thinkingto sort of stepping back being able to
 sort of make more connections being able to sort of say yeah but let'suse that thing sort of
 a huge new creativity being unleashed basically when you're young you're sortof thinking about that one problem you
 can sort of reconfigure all the variables combinatorially in your headand just
 wipe it all out when you're you know just a little olderyou start getting more creative you
 start bringing in things from different fields and differentcontexts and sort of stepping outside
 the box basically it's like being in the rat race and sayingthere's a ceiling why are we trying to
 get through that so it's sort of look you know thinking outside the boxand then at 40
 what i'm going through now is this whole sort of embracing the path of lifeand when i say life has started already
 it's not a test anymore this is basically embracing the finalityembracing that the journey is what it's
 at so what i like to say is live every dayas if it's your last one
 and make plans as if you'll never die i always have the long term that i'myou know sort of planning out for that
 will eventually become the short term and i always have the sort of short termand i think this ability to sort of look
 at life in the back in the past and look at life in thefuture jointly
 and sort of embrace the continuity both of life in the universeand on our planet as well as life as a
 human being from the beginning to the end just as apath as a journey
 and just embracing every aspect of that i mean i was talking about parenthoodthe other day and how amazingly
 fulfilling it is to sort of relive childhoodthrough the eyes of my kid but with the
 perspective of a parent so the thethe sheer you know um
 arrogance of youth yeah watching this in my kidi can see myself when i was 18
 correcting my professor i felt so proud yeah little did i know that my professorwas working on so much more interesting
 things than the three little things he was putting onthe board that day and i was like i'm
 invincible but in fact no just a little brat andbasically right now
 i i sort of can see the the the sort of journey with a littlemore humility
 i can sort of look at my own students with theirunbelievable abilities being able to do
 things that i'm no longer able to do better than i probably was ever able todo but yet
 being able to guide them and shape their thinkingand blow their minds with new ideas and
 new directions through my perspective and i know whensomething is solvable because i've been
 there but i'm not going to even bother it'snot that i can't do it
 i'm sure i could if i tried i just i'm not interested in that anymoreso what i'm embracing this journey of
 aging is how my brain is changing and howi'm constantly trying to figure out the
 niches the evolutionary niches that i'm best adapted forfor the tasks that i'm best at
 while hiring and recruiting both assistants and research scientistsand students and postdocs and you know
 that will be the best at those tasks so but someone still has to see the bigpicture
 and i love being in that role so you're

Speaker 1 :at
 the at the time scale of a human lifespan you're doing the same thingthat the worm
 did at the evolutionary time scale of uh growing arms ofthe specialization the car
 compartmentalization right he talks about i mean it'sfascinating to think of what
 uh 80 year old menolas would look back at theat the man that's sitting here today and
 and and laugh at the ceiling at the

Speaker 0 :arrogance finally figured out something
 i was like no little thing you didn't figure out anythingi mean ultimately it seems that if


Speaker 1 :you're introspective about life it all
 it leads to a kind of acceptance a deeper and deeper acceptance of thewhole of it


Speaker 0 :there again i want to be cautious about
 acceptance because it almost says that you can't change it

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :ah yeah it's it's sort of embracing the
 struggle and embracing the journey is the waythat i would put it so you ultimately


Speaker 1 :feel the
 journey isn't just something that happens to you your horse

Speaker 0 :you shape it you shape it remember how i
 was saying that boston is the best place and the best time to live in rightnow you know in the history of humanity
 i'm exaggerating a little bit but the way that i think about this isthat if you look at the hub in the whole
 of cosmos where would you rather be if you're justa bunch of molecules roughly your
 you know biomass where would you rather be would you rather be a rock on marsprobably not would you rather be in a
 black hole probably not would you rather be an explodingsupernova maybe that might be
 interesting but being on earth is an awesome solarsystem
 an awesome planetary system an awesome you know place to be inacross all of space time it's a pretty
 good place to be in as a bunch of moleculesif you are a bunch of molecules on earth
 today being an animal with you know some kind ofawareness of the stuff around you is
 wonderful being a human among all animalsis amazing because you have all this
 introspection and being a human who's young fitathletic
 smart etc i mean you know you have so much to behappy for beyond that being surrounded
 by a bunch of awesome people that you interact with all the timei mean i feel blessed to interact with
 the people i know the friends i have the dinners that i haveall of this the students that i interact
 with i'm so blessed and the last little little blip in thisawesomeness of local maximum
 the last little blip comes from being kindbeing grateful and being kind i don't
 know if you remember that little prayer that i described last timeof thank you for all the good you've
 given me and give me strength to give unto otherswith the same love that you've given to
 me and and the whole point of that is beinggrateful and being kind
 what does that do from a purely egoistic perspective it makes the people aroundyou happier
 and it takes that little maximum a little bit furtherbecause you'll be surrounded by happy
 people by being kind that's the purely egoistic view and thepurely altruistic view
 or maybe it's egoistic as well is that it just it's good to giveit feels good to give like basically
 watching somebody who's touched by what you said watching somebody who's likeappreciating a rapid response or a
 generous offer or just random acts of kindness is so fulfillingso evolutionarily we were selected for
 that they're just such a good feeling thatcomes from that


Speaker 1 :you know it's fascinating to think you
 said boston is the best place and talking about kindness that the verythought
 that boston is the place best place in the universeis almost it's a kind of a gravitational
 field uh like your thoughtand your very life in itself is a kind
 of field that makes that real

Speaker 0 :yeah so the self-fulfilling prophecy
 yeah and by by claiming it's the best andthinking is the best it becomes the best


Speaker 1 :and you make others
 it's it's a for it's not a force that just applies to yourown cognition exactly it applies to the
 others around you

Speaker 0 :and then suddenly you live in an even
 better place yeah and because you it

Speaker 1 :creates the reality the
 actual reality that the the social realityexactly it molds the environment exactly
 what's one of the coolest things about you i thinkis uh you represent
 uh the best of mit like the spirit of mitthere's um so i'm i'm so glad
 that i'm fortunate enough to be able to talk to you becauseum you know there's a kind of uh
 cynicism about academia in parts that i think is undeserved and thatthat there's a you know mit of course
 but academic institutions is a sacred place where ideas canflourish
 and just in the same very way that you're talking aboutis both kindness and uh
 curiosity and that like that weird thing that happens when a bunch ofcurious descendants of apes get together
 and just like get excited and this this uh uhripple effect that happens i mean that's
 the most beautiful aspect of mit people might think likecompetition and grants and
 like uh position like you said the rat race but like underneath it allis is these curious human beings
 inspiring younger human beings and there's this uh ripple effect thathappens and i'm so glad that
 i mean i'm glad that you that i get a chance to record thisbecause it inspires so many other
 students and so many other people uh to do the same to embrace the theinner curious
 creature that's not about the race so

Speaker 0 :let's talk about the negatives
 let's talk about no no no i'm serious i'm serious wait you know you have toembrace the good and the bad
 so let's talk about the negative as degree comes up let's address itum so why do people want positions of
 power why do people want you know more moneymore power more this more that
 remember the part where i was saying if you know who you are what other peoplethink about you
 it makes no difference to you it only teaches you about themmany people feel
 um define themselves they feel instantiated through the eyes of othersso being in a position of power
 makes them feel better about themselves who knows what other kind of strugglesthey might have
 that creates that need to feel better about themselvesbut they have a bunch of struggles and
 everybody has a bunch of struggles and every time i see somebody behavingpoorly i'm basically
 thinking well they're in a tough spot right nowand and it's okay you know i can i can
 kind of see how i would behave badly in other circumstances as well so ithink
 if you take away that sort of having to prove yourselfin the eyes of others life becomes so
 much easier so when i first became a professor atmit
 i started wearing adult clothes i had my likeyou know i mean before i became a


Speaker 1 :serious person


Speaker 0 :i i basically had you know i would i
 would always like go around in my rollerblades and my shorts and a t-shirtand eventually i was a professional like
 oh i bought all these khaki pants and youknow this nice
 like you know shirts with like you know whatever they call it thepatterns and i was like you know
 dressing with my nice belt every day showing upand then a few months later i was like i
 can't stand it and i just went back to my rollerbladesand my t-shirts and my shirts and it was
 this struggle of sort of not feeling that i fit in i was sointimidated by all of my colleagues
 like just watching their incredible achievements like persons next to me andthe person
 you know the floor below me i was like oh my god likethey clearly made a mistake what the
 heck am i doing here how will i ever live up to these people'sstandards and um
 eventually you grow up to realize that the way that i i grew up to realize thatthe way that other people perceived my
 work was very similar to the way that iperceived other people's work as
 flawless i knew all of the flaws in my work iknew
 the limitations i knew what i hadn't managed to achieveand what i saw was maybe a third of the
 way of what i was trying to achieve and i saw everything as flawed what theysaw was what i had achieved
 they didn't see what i hadn't achieved they only saw the one-third down whichwas pretty good in their eyes
 so they all respected me and i was feeling miserable about myself i waslike
 i'm not worthy and i think that this is a cognitive problem that we havewe kind of
 um it's kind of like when we're talking about artificial general intelligenceagi
 of sort of we kind of have this definition that anything that machinescan do
 is not intelligent right and anything that they can't do is intelligenttherefore
 we narrow in our narrow narrow the field of what intelligence truly means and assoon as machine learning not intelligent
 anymore i feel like i was doing the same thingwith myself as soon as i could solve
 something it was the kind of thing that a kid likeme could solve and therefore it was kind
 of easy but to the others it seemed hard yeahbut to me it seemed easy so it was this
 kind of thing that everything that my colleagues were doingseemed impossible to me but everything
 that i was doing seemed impossible to themso it was that realization that sort of
 made me mature into sort of a not more confident butmore comfortable
 human being can you actually linger on

Speaker 1 :that a little bit i mean
 you mentioned minsky remember he said something in an interviewwhere he said the secret to his um like
 the way he approached life was to never be happy with anything he didso there's a something powerful as a
 motivator to to uh doing exactly what you'resaying which is everything you've
 achieved to see that as easy and unimpressivewhat do you do with that because clearly
 that's a i think useful thing i think i've kind

Speaker 0 :of matured past that
 and i think the maturity past that is to sort of acceptwhat it is and accept that
 it has helped others build onto it and therefore advance human knowledge soit's very easy to sort of fall into the
 trap of oh everything i've done is crap what i told you last time is that ialways tell my students that our best
 work is ahead of us and i think that's more of my mindsetthat's a beautiful way to put it


Speaker 1 :exactly what we've done is it's great


Speaker 0 :it's great for the time and it'll become
 obsolete in 30 years yeah not we can we are doing even betterwe're doing it
 exactly so basically our next work will juststrive and and again you can't you can't
 let the perfect be the enemy of the good at some point you have to rap i washaving a meeting with my student
 yesterday and it was like listen we know this isnot perfect
 but it's way better than anything that's ever been done beforeyou know how to improve it but if you
 try to your paper is never going to getpublished so
 so it you know there's this balance of we're already at the top of the fieldget it out
 and then you work on the next improvement and in my experience thishas never happened we've never actually
 worked on the next improvement and that's okayit didn't make a difference because
 you're basically putting a new stepping stonethat others will be able to step on and
 surpass you my advisor in grad school wouldbasically tell me
 manolis let others write the second paper in that fieldjust write the first one move on move on
 to the next field you don't want to be writing the secondand the third and the fourth and the
 fifth paper in the same field just it's veryshocking to a student to hear that
 because i was like i was at the top of my gamei was owning that field and i published
 the first paper i'm like i'm ready for two and three and fourhe's like move on just let it be
 and i was like whoa and it's so liberatingto sort of not have to surpass everyone
 but just just put your little stepping stone outthere
 and others will step on it and put their own stones further and eventually crossa bigger river
 than if you try to sort of make a giant leap all at onceso you need both beautifully put


Speaker 1 :so the funny thing is uh i've uh i
 believe i closed the previous episode with a darwin quote aboutuh the power of poetry and music and
 life i think your quote and again i only

Speaker 0 :heard once was
 darwin basically saying if i were to live life again next timei would read more poetry and
 something about art every week or something like that yeah

Speaker 1 :yeah it's so interesting for somebody
 who studied uh life at a very cold i would say geneticlevel to say that
 yeah the the highest form of living is is the art but like on that whichmade me realize that you write poetry
 and i uh um forced you or maybe convinced yousomehow
 to uh to maybe share if it's possible if it's okaysome of uh the poetry you've written
 yourself in your life so um again being

Speaker 0 :greek
 a lot of my poems have been pretty miserableand uh i always like to say that it's
 very hard for me to write a poem without when i'm happyand i just have to be in a state of deep
 despair in order to write poems but the first poem i ever wrotewas in uh english class i was
 i'm in greek i grew up in kris but i was in a french high school and i was takingenglish as a foreign language
 so the english teacher basically asked us to write a poemin english so this is basically what uh
 what i'm going to embarrass myself and read from my 16 year old selfmany many years ago can you give a


Speaker 1 :little bit more context about who you
 were in this moment so like just so so here's what's really

Speaker 0 :interesting in terms of growing up
 how do we grow up um it's very difficult to grow up if you'rein the same school going from one class
 to the other and all your friends know you inside outit's very difficult to change
 it's very difficult to to grow up because they have a certain set ofexpectations for who you are
 and for how you're going to behave so in in many ways we kind oftend to get set in our ways and not
 change very much i think something that helped me grow upis that when i was
 11 years old i was a kid in greece in primary school when i was 12 yearsold i was a kid in greece
 in a you know first year of high school when i was 13 i was in franceso basically moved countries and schools
 the next year i moved schools again because it was a transition in thefrench educational system from one
 school to the next the next year after that my family movedto new york in a french high school
 there and then the next day after that i'mmoving to mit uh so
 basically between 11 and 19 every single yeari actually had the opportunity to grow i
 was not held by people who knew meand i could reinvent myself or reshape
 myself or reshape my you know sort of personality my emotionsmy you know as i was growing up
 especially in such a transformative time of a kid's lifefrom 11 to 17. okay first of all it's so


Speaker 1 :powerful that you think of it that way
 did you think of it that way at the momentbecause it's kind of a source you said
 an opportunity to grow it's kind of suffering i mean you'rebeing torn away from the thing you know
 into a thing you don't know

Speaker 0 :so when we moved from south france to
 new york i was pissed i was pissed i i was taking these longbike rides in the countryside
 jumping in friends swimming pools and i had all these wonderfulfriendships going downtown and just
 staying by the fountains in the dim lit streets of exxon provence in the southof france it was
 magical and suddenly i moved to new york citya city of cement of ugliness
 like trash in the streets and every corner is horriblesnow everywhere having never seen snow
 or like real snow in my life i moved from athens to south france tosouthern new york so
 i was pissed but whether i saw it as an opportunity for growth i don't think soi don't think that i was that
 self-reflective it was just only now you

Speaker 1 :see it this way


Speaker 0 :i i saw it like that probably pretty
 early on but not during those transitions so basicallyduring this transition i was just a kid
 being a kid you know and um maybe the time that i started seeing itthat way was
 maybe when i decided to stay at mit as a professorafter having been there as a student and
 i kind of saw the struggle of getting professors tonot see you
 as a kid when they're your peers and i was very flattered when one of myuh
 friends basically told me oh i remember you in recitation when you first askedme a question
 i said wow this kid i'll pay attention one day it'll be a pier so so it's it'syou know
 certainly my perception was that many of them could not see me as anything but akid
 but it turns out that some of them saw me as something different than a kideven
 before i was actually their colleague so it's it's kind of an interesting placebecause
 what i like to say about mit is that people treat you as equalno matter what stage and they respect
 you for what you say not for who you are when you're saying itand if i'm wrong my students will tell
 me they will have no reservation to just be bluntlyyou know sorry i don't agree with that


Speaker 1 :yeah i mean the the beautiful thing uh
 about you sorry to to put it this way is uhyou know maybe people who weren't
 familiar with your work beforehand might think uh like

Speaker 0 :you might not realize that you're a


Speaker 1 :world-class scientist leads a large
 group and so on they because there's a youthful natureto you that
 it's i mean you talk like a like a first like an undergradyou know with the excitement and the
 fresh eyes and the sort of excitement about the world and that'sfirst of all super contagious and
 beautiful you know it's easy to sort of fall intouh behaving seriously because then
 people kind of um start putting you on a pedestalmore into a position of power you you
 want to sort of act like you're in a position of poweras opposed to
 allowing yourself to be lost in the just the curiosity thethe childish view of the world which is
 just this open-eyed love of knowledge and that was the

Speaker 0 :transition that i was describing when i
 decided to go back to my rollerblades and t-shirt andbaseball cap basically um you know when
 i when i met my first postdoc uh it wasbasically
 you know he was interviewing for postdocs at mit he already had severalfirst author papers to his name in top
 journals and my friend julia basically introducedme to
 to to alex stark who basically was interviewing at the time with rick youngand with
 eric lander just like these massive names in the fieldand i was just a first-year faculty
 person with you know zero credibility andshe basically says oh there's this
 friend of mine alex who's visiting he's also germanyou know he wanted to meet you i'm like
 oh sounds great i'd love to talk science i show up we sit at the amphitheater instata uh
 you know i basically arrive in my rollerbladesyou know jump a few steps sit down
 wearing my blades we're having this awesome conversation about science andabout gene regulation and how the whole
 thing works and sort of you know my perspective and hisperspective or just bouncing ideas for
 30 minutes and then i just dash off to my nextmeeting and he basically emails me
 afterwards and i was giving him advice about how tointerview with eric lander how to
 interview with rick young and how to sort of get a position with themand then after uh after a while he
 emails me saying i would love to become a postdoc in your groupi'm like what are you kidding me like
 wow so so uh he basically didn't carethat i would wear roller blades and
 t-shirt all he cared about was my ideas and sort ofembracing the me with the childhood
 excitement about science was basically what attracted himit wasn't the wow this guy runs a big
 lab or this and that he was just like i like his ideas i wantto work with him


Speaker 1 :that by the way folks is the best of mit
 that's what mit stands for so that's a beautthat's a beautiful story but take me
 back to the poem and where did this poem come from whatnow where's your mind's
 set so who's the 17 16 year old kid manolas

Speaker 0 :so uh again i've i've just seen snow for
 the first time and i'm is this new york this is newyork so
 i'm you know maybe that's where the sadness in the poem comes from butanyway
 we're asked in class to write an assignment this is my third language i'mnot very good at it
 so pardon me but here's what i wrote children dance now all in row childrenlaughing
 at the snow but in times endless flow children sooner or later grow men aremortal
 we go by if we know it we may cry but i thought a love so sweet wasimmortal was so deep
 there i told you darling sweet that forever love would keepblossomed spring and summer shined then
 blue autumn winter died one year passedbut the clouds still remember all our
 vows never faked and never lied all we didwas stare
 and smile all alone sitting down to the snow we made our vow but you toldme
 you were right birds who love are birds who crynow with laughter children play
 yet the sky is so grey even if the snow seems bright withoutyou have lost their light
 sun that sang and moon that smiled all the stars have ceased to shineall of nature drew its grace found its
 light within your face now you're gone and won't return let thesnow
 and my heart burn there's a greek

Speaker 1 :that's beautiful that's beautiful by the


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :way and and the rhyming the musicality
 there's a there's a both of simplicity i'm language no

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :no no but like i so i really enjoy like
 robert frost poems i don't mean simplicity so what a badway and then a negative way again it's


Speaker 0 :very weird to analyze your own poem
 but i think it captures the simplicity of youth and the way that it kind ofstarts with children dance line only
 though it basically and it kind of shows that snow can beinterpreted first
 in the first verse as a happy thing and then in the end you knownow with laughter children play i'm like
 now i've grown basically it's it's this transformation that we'reactually talking about this whole men
 are mortal we go by i'm sort of you know you're saying areyou comfortable with growing old i'm
 like duh i was i was since i was 16. yeahand what's really interesting is that
 you know again when i was 12 years old in our summer house in greece i remembersort of telling my sister
 my outlook that i would have as a father for how to bring up my own kidsso it's very weird that i've always sort
 of seen the full path from you know a kid when you were youngyeah i don't know if you you like this
 johnny mitchell song i've looked at clouds from both sidesnow from up and down
 and still somehow it's those illusions i recallit yeah it's clouds illusions i recall i
 really don't know clouds at all so it's it's really beautiful so so ithink the johnny mitchell song which
 again i heard for the first time much much after thisum and i wouldn't even compare this to
 that but what johnny mitch is saying that songis that you can see life from two
 perspectives you can see the good or the bad in bothyou know in everything you see and i
 think that's the allegory of snow right now you can see snowas this bright white wonderful thing or
 you can see snow as this miserable you know gray thing so that sort ofand what i like about the last verse now
 with laughter children play is that it's a recall to the first onewhere i was the kid
 enjoying careless life and eventually was making promises thatsomething would be forever
 and i think part of that is also the loss of my friendships in franceof being in new york now and sort of
 everything is gray and you know even though the snow seemsbright
 without you have lost their light some that sang and moon that's mild soit's this um this concept that if you
 lose your love the same thing can be perceived in avery different way


Speaker 1 :let me ask you this because somebody
 wrote me this long email and i think you're the perfect person toask this


Speaker 0 :um you mentioned love


Speaker 1 :from a genetic perspective
 what what's what is it what what do you make of love why why are wewhy do we humans fall in love
 in your own life why did you fall in love you knowthe email that was written to me was
 you always talk about mortality and fear of mortalitybut you don't ask about love
 some i don't know if there's some thoughts you could give aboutthe role of love in your own life


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :or the role of life the role of love in
 human life in general i think

Speaker 0 :love in many ways defines my life it's
 basically i like to say that i'm a human first and a professorsecond and uh i think this passion
 for life this passion for you know everything around usi mean the only way to describe that is
 love it's basically you know embracing youryou know emotional self embracing the
 you know the [Music]the the non brainiac in you embracing
 the sort of intangible thenot very well defined and even in my on
 my own research i'm just very passionate about everything i doand you know there's a certain passion
 that comes through and what i'm sorry again being greek theetymology of the word passion what was
 passion passion is sufferingthe etymology when we talk about the
 passion of the christ it's the suffering yeah and in the greek version of thatword pathos
 like pathology pathos is deep suffering it's the concept andsomeone who's sympathetic sympathetic
 means suffering together experiencing emotions together so it'sfunny that you ask me about love and i
 respond with passion passion for life passion for researchpassion for my family for my children
 for you know so um there's there's a certainpassion that uh defines me
 and everything else follows rather than the other way around i'm notfirst thinking with my brain what is the
 most impactful people we could write and then going after that i'm thinkingwith my heart what am i passionate about
 what drives me which just like you know makesme take


Speaker 1 :and that's a beautiful way to live but i
 i love it how the greek part of you just kind of connects it to the suffering soif you could remove the suffering no no


Speaker 0 :no no when i say suffering
 i don't mean suffering as in being miserablei mean suffering as in being emotionally
 invested in something remember i mean again if you if you lookat this poem what is it saying it's
 saying birds who love are birds who cryright it's that's the very definition of
 love exposing your fragility if you're notafraid of suffering
 you don't fall in love as soon as you hold backyou protect you shield your heart no
 love can enter so there's this uh simon garfunkel songi am a rock i am an island
 and a rock feels no pain and an island never cries so again there's some aspectof that
 into this poem the you know the fact thatum you know but you told me you know
 there i told you darling sweet that forever love would keep is thisintermediate thing and then there's a
 recall but you told me you were right birds could love or burst who cryso it basically says that love is the
 fragility that you're willing to give to anotherperson it's opening up your
 uh vulnerable spots it's sort of acceptingthat there's no safety net
 you're just giving yourself fully and you're ready to be hurt

Speaker 1 :so you've already been way too kind with
 your time but i'm gonna force you to stay here just a few minutes longer aswe're talking about
 uh goodbyes you have a really nice other poem hereabout goodbyes can i force you to read
 it as well

Speaker 0 :oh twist my arm twist my arm so um and
 the next poem was written uh specifically for our highschool yearbook
 so uh another poem written on demand the rest of them are just so miserablewritten by pure you know sadness and
 melancholy but this one was also written on demandand it was basically um saying goodbye
 as it's appropriate right now to my friends and sort of againreflecting this whole journey and
 transformation through life and also i think showing a little bit ofintrospection
 about how we kind of had it easy in high schooland we're about to go into rougher
 waters so the title is actually the tidewatersand it's an analogy on that so here it
 goes all this was another lake where somerest
 we sailer stake water's calm and full of fishwe'll find there what we wish some seek
 fruit and others feast some of us just lookfor peace
 some find fresh other love some seek bothand neither have we were different when
 we came it's his own story and fame differentpeople had we been
 different cultures had we seen different naturedifferent faiths each unlike all in this
 place we had faced success defeat that in onelake
 came to meet there the orders that we followedand the pride that we swallowed made us
 one but not the same joined us strangers who there camesooner later groups were made tribes
 where differences will fade some attached more or lessothers fought and made a mess but again
 we have to go what for where to we don't know still weknow
 it we will try there to rush to flee to fly there'll be some who wish to staybut will carry on away we will continue
 on our journey as we came here strong yet lonelyfrom the lake a river flows from the
 river many goals on that river we will race each will tryto find his pace
 in that scene the sailors face their firstfear defeat disgrace
 here and there comes out a face that the waterssoon embrace some get lucky
 find their way others sink beneath the wavesin this race we will part some will
 settle near the start some set goals beyond thestars
 because the river carries far you should knowin what we've done the hard part is
 still to come so i'll have to say goodbye don't youworry
 i won't cry neither will they those who trytill the end to keep their pride
 but please know dearest friends who are always there to mendi will always need your hand i will miss
 you till the end i don't think there's a

Speaker 1 :better way to end it
