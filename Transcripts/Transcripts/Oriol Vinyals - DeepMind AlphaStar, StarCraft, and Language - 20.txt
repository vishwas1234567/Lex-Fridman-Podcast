Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Ariane Vinnie Alice he's a senior research scientist at google deepmindand before that he was a Google brain
 and Berkeley his research has been cited over 39,000 times he's truly one of themost brilliant and impactful minds in
 the field of deep learning he's behind some of the biggest papersand ideas and AI including sequence the
 sequence learning audio generation image captioning neural machine translationand of course reinforcement learning
 he's a lead researcher of the Alpha Star project creating an agent that defeateda top professional at the game of
 StarCraft this conversation is part of the artificial intelligence podcast ifyou enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes
 or simply connect with me on twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fri D and nowhere's my conversation with Arielle
 Minnie Alice you spearheaded the deepmind team behindalpha star that recently beat a top
 professional player Starcraft so you have an incredible wealth of work anddeep learning in a bunch of fields but
 let's talk about Starcraft first let's go back to the very beginning evenbefore alpha star before deep mine
 before deep learning first what came first for you a lot for programming or a

Speaker 0 :love for videogames I think for me it
 definitely came first the drive to play videogames I really liked computers Ididn't really code much but what I would
 do is I would just mess with the computer break it and fix it that wasthe level of skills I guess that I
 gained in my very early days I mean when I was 10 or 11 and then I really gotinto video games especially Starcraft
 actually the first version I spent most of my time just playing kind of pseudoprofessionally as professionally as you
 could play back in 98 in Europe which was not a very main scene like thatwhat's called nowadays eSports right of


Speaker 1 :course in the 90s so how did you get
 into StarCraft what was your favorite race how do you develop how did youdevelop your skill what was your
 strategy all that kind of thing so as a

Speaker 0 :player I tended to try to play not many
 games not to kind of disclose the strategies that I kind of developed andI like to play random actually not in
 competitions but just to I think in StarCraft there's well there's threemain races and I found it very useful to
 play with all of them and so I would choose random many times even sometimesin tournaments to gain skill on the
 three races because it's not how you play against someone but also if youunderstand the race because you play it
 you also understand what's annoying what then when you're on the other side whatto do to annoy that person to try to
 gain advantages here and there and so on so I actually played random although Imust say in terms of favorite race I
 really liked zerk I was probably best at Zerg and that's probably what I tend touse towards the end of my career
 year before starting University so let's

Speaker 1 :step back a little bit could you try to
 describe Starcraft to people that may never have played video games especiallythe massively online variety right so


Speaker 0 :craft so Starcraft is a real-time
 strategy game and the way to think about Starcraft perhaps if you understand abit chess is that there are there's a
 board which is called map or or or the gallic the map where people play againsteach other there's obviously many ways
 you can play but the most interesting one is the one versus one setup whereyou just play against someone else or
 even the built in AI right the wizard put a system that can play the gamereasonably well if you don't know how to
 play and then in this board you have again pieces like in chess but thesepieces are not there initially like they
 are in chess you actually need to decide to gather resources to decide whichpieces to build so in a way you're
 starting almost with no pieces you start gathering resources in StarCraft there'sminerals and gas that you you can gather
 and then you must decide how much do you want to focus for instance on gatheringmore resources or starting to build
 units or pieces and then once you have enough pieces or maybe like attack youknow a good attack composition then you
 go and attack the other side of the map and now the other main difference withchess is that you don't see the other
 side of the map so you're not seeing the moves of the enemy it's what we callpartially observable
 so as a result you must not only decide Trading of economy versus building yourown units but you also must decide
 whether you want to scout to gather information but also byscouting you might be giving away some
 information that you might be hiding from the enemy so there's a lot ofcomplex decision-making all in real-time
 there's also unlike chess this is not a turn-based game you play basically allthe time continuously and thus some
 skill in terms of speed and accuracy of clicking is also very important andpeople that train for these really play
 this game at an amazing skill I've seen many times these and if youcan witness this life is really really
 impressive so in a way it's kind of a chess where you don't see the other sideof the board you're building your own
 pieces and you also need to gather resources to basically get some money tobuild other buildings pieces technology
 and so on

Speaker 1 :from the perspective of the human player
 the difference between that and chess or maybe that and a game like turn-basedstrategy like heroes a might of magic is
 that there's an anxiety because you have to make these decisions really quicklyand if you are not actually aware or
 what decisions work it's a very stressful balance the if there'severything you describe is actually
 quite stressful difficult to balance for a mature human player I don't know if itgets easier at the professional level
 like if they're fully aware what they have to do but at the amateur levelthere's this anxiety oh crap I'm being
 attacked oh crap I have to build up resource oh I have to probably expandand all these the time the real-time
 strategy aspect is really stressful and computation I'm sure difficult we'll getinto it but for me battlenet so
 Starcraft was released in 98 20 years ago which is hard to believe andBlizzard battlenet with Diablo 96 came
 out and to me it might be a narrow perspective but it changed online gamingand perhaps society forever
 yeah but I may have made way too narrow viewpoint but from your perspective canyou talk about the history of gaming
 over the past 20 years is this how transformational how important is this

Speaker 0 :line of games right so I think I I kind
 of was an active gamer whilst this was developing the internet I'm onlinegaming so for me that the way it came
 was I played other games strategy related I play a bit of common andconquer and then I played Warcraft 2
 which is from Blizzard but at the time I didn't know I didn't understand aboutwhat Blizzard was or anything Warcraft 2
 was just a game which is which was actually very similarto start off in many ways it's also
 real-time strategy game and where there's orcs and humans so there's onlytwo races throughs offline and it was
 offline right so I remember a friend of mine came to to school say oh there'sthis new cool game called Starcraft and
 I just said all these sounds like just a copy of Warcraft 2 until I kind ofinstalled it and at the time I am from
 Spain so we didn't have internet like very good internet right so there wasfor us a Starcraft became first kind of
 an offline experience where you kind of start to play these missions right youplay against some sort of scripted
 things to develop the story of the characters in the game and then later onI start playing against the butene AI
 and I thought it was impossible to defeat it then eventually you defeat oneand you can actually break n7 built in
 the eyes at the same time which also felt impossible but actually it's notthat hard to beat seven built-in eyes at
 once so once we achieve that also we discovered that we could play as I saidinternet wasn't that great but we could
 play with the land right on like basically against each other if we werein the same place because you could just
 connect machines with like cables right so we started playing in LAN mode andagain you know as a group of friends and
 it was really really like much more entertaining than playing against theeyes and later on as internet was
 starting to develop and being a bit faster and more reliable then it's whenI started experiencing battlenet which
 is these amazing universe not only because of the fact that you can playthe game against any way anyone in the
 world but you can also get to know more peopleyou just get exposed to now like this
 vast variety of it's kind of a bit when the chats came about right there was achat system you could play against
 people where you could also chat with people not only about soccer but aboutanything and that became a way of life
 for kind of two years and obviously then it became like an elite exploded didn'tmean that I started to play more
 seriously going to tournaments and so on so forth

Speaker 1 :do you have a sense and a societal
 sociological level what whole part of society that many of usare not aware of and it's a huge part of
 society which is gamers I mean every time I come across that in YouTube orstreaming sites I mean this is a huge
 number of people play games religiously do you have a sense of those folksespecially now that you've returned to
 that realm a little bit on the high side

Speaker 0 :yeah so in fact I even after soccer if I
 actually played World of Warcraft which is mainly the main sort of online worldor in presence that you get to interact
 with lots of people so I played that for a little bit it was to me it was a bitless stressful than Starcraft because
 winning was kind of a given you just put in this world and you can alwayscomplete missions but I think it was
 actually the social aspect of especially Starcraft first and then games likeWorld of Warcraft really shaped me in a
 very interesting ways because you had you get to experience it's just peopleyou wouldn't usually interact with right
 so even nowadays I still have many Facebook friends from the area where Iplayed online and their ways of thinking
 is even political they just don't we don't live in like we don't interact inthere in the real world but we were
 connected by basically fiber and that way I actually get to understand a bitbetter that we live in a diverse world
 and these were just connections that were made by because you know I happenedto go in a city in a virtual city as a
 priest and I met these you know this warrior and we became friends and thenwe start like playing together right so
 I think it's it's it's transformative and more and more and more people aremore aware of it I mean it's it's
 becoming quite mainstream but back in the day as you were saying in 2000 2005even it was very still very strange
 thing to do especially in in Europe I think there were exceptions like Koreafor instance it was amazing like that
 that everything happened so early in terms of cyber cafes like it's if you goto Seoul it's a city that back in the
 day Starcraft was kind of you could be a celebrity by playing Starcraft but thiswas like 99 2000 right it's not like
 recently so um yeah it's quite it's quiteinteresting to to look back and and yeah
 I think it's changing society that the same way of course like technology andsocial networks and so on are also
 transforming things and a quick tangent

Speaker 1 :let me ask you're also one of the most
 productive people in your particular chosen passion and path in life and yetyou're also appreciate and enjoy video
 games do you think it's possible to do to enjoy video games in moderation

Speaker 0 :someone told me that you could choose
 two out of three when I was playing video games you could choose having agirlfriend playing video games or
 studying and I think for the most part it was relatively true these things dotake time games like stark if you take
 the game pretty seriously and you wanna study it then you obviously willdedicate more time to it and I
 definitely took gaming and obviously studying very seriously I loved learningscience and etc so to me especially when
 I started University undergrad I kind of step off Starcraft I actually fullystopped playing and then wall of war
 curve was a bit more casual you could just connect online and I mean it was itwas fun but I as I said that was not as
 much time investment as it was for me in

Speaker 1 :StarCraft ok so let's get into alpha
 star what are the your behind the team so deep mine has been working onStarcraft and released a bunch of cool
 open-source agents and so on the past few years but alpha star really is themoment where the first time you beat a
 world-class player so what are the parameters of the challenge in the waythat alpha star took it on and how did
 you and David and the rest of deepmind team get into itconsider that you can even beat the best


Speaker 0 :in the world or top players I think it
 all started in back in 2015 actually I'm lying I think it was 2014when the mine was acquired by Google and
 I at the time was at Google brain which is it it was in Californiain California we had this summit where
 we got together the two groups so Google brain and google deepmind got togetherand we gave a series of talks and given
 that they were doing deep reinforcement learning for games I decided to bring uppart of my past which I had developed at
 Berkeley like this thing which we called Berkeley over mine which is really justa Starcraft one but right so I about
 that and I remember them is just came to me and said well maybe not now it's it'sperhaps a bit too early but you should
 just come to the mine and do this again with deep reinforcement learning rightand at the time it sounded very
 science-fiction for for several reasons but then in 2016 when I actually movedto London and joined in mind
 transferring from brain it became apparent that because of the alphagomoment and kind of Blizzard reaching out
 to us to say wait like do you want the next challenge and also me beingfull-time at deep mine it's a sort of
 kind of all these came together and then I was I went to to air vine inCalifornia to the Blizzard headquarters
 to just chat with them and try to explain how would it all work before youdo anything and the approach has always
 been about the learning perspective right so in in Berkeley we did a lot ofrule-based you know conditioning and or
 if you have more than three units then go attack and if the other has moreunits than me I retreat and so on and so
 forth and of course the point of deep reinforcement learning deep learningmachine learning in general is that all
 these should be learned behavior so that kind of was the DNA of the project sinceits inception in 2016 where we just
 didn't even have an environment to work with and so these that's how it allstarted really so if you go back to a


Speaker 1 :conversation with damage or even in your
 own head how far away did you because that's we're talking about Atari gameswe're talking about go which is kind of
 if you're honest about it really far away from Starcraft in a well now thatyou've beaten it maybe you could say
 it's close but is it's much it seems like Starcraft is way harder than gophilosophically in mathematically
 speaking so how far away did you did you think you were do you think it's 2019 in18 you could be doing as well as you


Speaker 0 :have yeah when I when I kind of thought
 about okay I'm gonna dedicate know a lot of my time and focus on this andobviously I do a lot of different
 research in deep learning so spending time on it I mean I really had to kindof think there's gonna be something good
 happening out of this so really I thought well this sounds impossible andit probably is impossible to do the full
 thing like the all like the full game where you play one versus one and it'sonly a neural network playing and so on
 so it really felt like I just didn't even think it was possible but on theother hand I could see some stepping
 stones like towards that goal clearly you could define subproblems inStarCraft and sort of dissect it a bit
 and say okay here is a part of the game here's another part and also obviouslythe fact so this was really also
 critical to me the fact that we could access human replays right so Blizzardwas very kind and in fact they
 open-source these for the whole community where you can just go and it'snot every single Starcraft game ever
 played but it's a lot of them you can just go and download and every day theywill you can just query a dataset and
 say well give me all the games that were played today and given my kind ofexperience with language and sequences
 and supervised learning I thought well that's definitely gonna be very helpfuland something quite unique now because
 ever before we had such a large dataset of replays of people playing the game atthis scale of such a complex video game
 right so that to me was a precious resource and as soon as I knew thatBlizzard was able to kind of give these
 to the community I started to feel positive about something non-trivialhappening but but I also thought the
 full thing like really no rules no no single line of code that tries to saywell I mean if you see this unit will
 the detector all these not having any of these specializations seemed reallyreally really difficult to me


Speaker 1 :I do also like that Blizzard was teasing
 or even trolling you sort of almost yeah pulling you in into this reallydifficult challenge they have any aware
 and that what's what's the interest from the perspective of Blizzard except just

Speaker 0 :curiosity yeah I think Blizzard has
 really understood and and really bring bring forward these competitiveness ofeSports in games the Starcraft really
 kind of sparked a lot of like something that almost was never seen especially asI was saying he back in Korea so they
 just probably thought well this is such a pure 1vs1 setup that it would be greatto see if something that can play Atari
 or go and then later on chess could could even tackle these kind of complexrealtime strategy game right so for them
 they wanted to see first obviously whether it was possible if the game theycreated was in a way solvable to some
 extent and I think on the other hand they also are a pretty modern companythat innovates a lot so just starting to
 understand AI for them to how to bring AI into games is not is not AI for gamesbut get a games for AI oh right I mean
 both ways I think can work and you up we obviously did mine use games for AIright to drive AI progress but Blizzard
 might actually be able to do and many other companies to start to understanddone to the opposite so I think that is
 also something they can get out of these and they definitely we have brainstorm alot about about these right but one of


Speaker 1 :the interesting things to me about
 Starcraft and Diablo and these games that blizzards created is the task ofbalancing classes for example sort of
 making the game fair from the starting point and then let's skill the term andthe outcome is there uh I mean can you
 first comment there's three races Zerg Protoss and Terran I don't know if I'veever said that out loud is that how you


Speaker 0 :pronounce it Terran yeah yeah I don't


Speaker 1 :think I've ever seen personally interact
 with anybody about Starcraft it's funny

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :so they seem to be pretty balanced
 I wonder if the AI the work that you're doing with the Alpha star would helpbalance them even further is that
 something you think about is that something that Blizzard is thinking

Speaker 0 :about right so so balancing when you add
 a new unit or a new spell type is obviously possible given that you canalways train or retrain at scale some
 agent that might start using that in unintended ways but I think actually ifyou understand how StarCraft has kind of
 co-evolved with players in a way I think it's actually very cool the ways thatmany of the things and strategies that
 people came up with right so I think it's we've seen it over and over inStarCraft that Blizzard comes up with
 maybe a new unit and then some players get creative and do something kind ofunintentional or something that Blizzard
 designers that just simply didn't test or think about and then after thatbecomes kind of mainstream in the
 community Blizzard patches the game and and then they kind of maybe weaken thatstrategy or or make it actually more
 interesting but a bit more balanced so these kind of continual talk betweenplayers and Blizzard is is kind of what
 has defined them actually in actually most games that the in in stykera butalso in World of Warcraft they would do
 that there are several classes and it would be not good that everyone playsabsolutely the same race or and so on
 right so I think they they do care about balancing of course and they do a fairamount of testing but it's also
 beautiful to to also see how players get creative anyways and I mean whether Ican be more creative at this point I
 don't think so right I mean it's just sometimes something so amazing happenslike I remember back in in the days like
 you have these drop ships that could drop rivers and that was actually notthought about that you could drop this
 unit that has this what's called Splash Damage that would basically eliminateall the enemies workers at once no one
 thought that you could actually put them and really early game do that kind ofdamage and then we know things change in
 the game but I don't know I think there's it's quite an amazingexploration process from both sides
 players and Blizzard alike well

Speaker 1 :it's it's almost like a reinforcement
 learning exploration but a the scale of humans that play that play Blizzardgames is almost on the scale of a
 large-scale deepmind RL experiment I mean if you look at the numbers that's Imean you're talking about I don't know
 how many games but hundreds of thousands of games probably a month yeah I mean sothat you could it's almost the same as
 running RL agents what an aspect of the problem of StarCraft II things thehardest is it the like you said the
 imperfect information is it the fact they have to do long term planning is itthe real time aspects we have to do
 stuff really quickly is it the fact that a large action space that you can do somany possible things or is it you know
 in the game theoretic sense there is no Nash equilibria at least you don't knowwhat the optimal strategy is because
 there's way too many options right what's is there something that standsout is just like the hardest the most


Speaker 0 :annoying thing so when we sort of looked
 at the problem and start to define permit like the parameters of it rightwhat are the observations what are the
 actions it became very apparent that you know that the very first barrier thatone would hit in StarCraft would be
 because of the action space being so large and as not being able to searchlike you could in in chess or or go even
 though the search space is vast the main problem that we identified was that ofexploration right so without any sort of
 human knowledge or human prior if you think about StarCraft and you know howdeep reinforcement learning is algorithm
 works work which is essentially by issuing random actions and hoping thatthey will get some wins sometimes so
 they could learn so if you think of the of the action space in StarCraft almostanything you can do in the early game is
 bad because any action involves taking workers which are mining minerals forfree that's something that the game does
 automatically sends them to mine and you would immediately just take them out ofmining and send them around so just
 thinking how how is it gonna be possible to to get to understand thethese concepts but but even more like
 expanding right there's there's these buildings you can place in otherlocations in the map to gather more
 resources but the location of the building is important and you have toselect a worker send it walking to that
 location build the building wait for the building to be built and then put extraworkers there so they start mining that
 just that feels like impossible if you just randomly click to produce thatstate desirable state that then you
 could hope to learn from because eventually that may yield to an extrawin right so for me the exploration
 problem and due to the actions pace and the fact that there's not really turnsthere's so many turns because the game
 essentially peaks at 22 times per second if you mean that's how they keepdiscretize sort of time obviously you
 always have to discretize time there's not no such thing as real time but it'sreally a lot of time steps of things
 that could go wrong and that definitely felt a priori like the hardest youmentioned many good ones I think partial
 observability and the fact that there is no perfect strategy because of thepartial observability those are very
 interesting problems we start seeing more and more now in terms of us wesolve the previous ones but the core
 problem to me was exploration and solving it has been basically kind ofthe focus and how we saw the first


Speaker 1 :breakthroughs so exploration you know in
 a multi hierarchical way so like 22 times the second exploration is a verydifferent meaning than it does in terms
 of should I gather resources early or should I wait or so on so how do yousolve the long-term let's talk about the


Speaker 0 :internals of alpha stuff so first of all


Speaker 1 :how do you represent the state of the
 game as an input right how do you then do the long term sequence modeling howdo you build a policy right also what's


Speaker 0 :the architecture like so alpha star has
 obviously several components but everything passes through what we callthe policy which is a neural network and
 that's kind of the beauty of it there is I could just now give you a neuralnetwork and some weights
 and if you fed the right observations and you understood the actions the sameway we do you would have basically the
 agent playing the game there's absolutely nothing else needed otherthan those weights that were trained now
 the first step is observing the game and we've experimented with a fewalternatives the one that we currently
 use mixes both spatial sort of images that you would process from the gamethat is the zoomed out version of the of
 the map and also assume the inversion of the camera or the screen as we call itbut also we give to the agent the list
 of units that it sees more of as a set of objects that it can operate on thatis not necessarily required to use it
 and we have versions of the game that play well without this set vision thatis a bit not like how humans perceive
 the game but it certainly helps a lot because it's a very natural way toencode the game is by just looking at
 all the units that there are there they have properties like health positiontype of unit whether it's my unit or the
 enemies and that's sort of is kind of the the summary of the state of the ofthe game note that list of units or set
 of units that you see all the time well

Speaker 1 :that's pretty close to the way humans
 see it again why do you say it's not isn't it you're saying the exactness ofit is not yeah other humans the


Speaker 0 :exactness of it is perhaps not the
 problem I guess maybe the problem if you look at it from how actually humans playthe game is that they play with a mouse
 on a keyboard and a screen and they don't see sort of a structured objectwith all the units what they see is what
 they see on the screen right yes so

Speaker 1 :remember that there's a certain
 interrupt there's a plot that you showed with camera base where you do exactlythat right move around and that seems to
 converge it to similar performance yeah

Speaker 0 :I think that's what I we're kind of
 experimenting with what's necessary or not but using the set so actually if youlook at research in computer vision
 where it makes a lot of sense to treat images as two-dimensional arrays thereis actually a very nice paper from
 Facebook I think I forgot who the authorsbut I think it's part of gaming's has
 group and what they do is they take an image which is this two-dimensionalsignal and they actually take pixel by
 pixel and scramble the image as if it was just a list of pixels and cruciallythey encode the position of the pixels
 with at the XY coordinates and this is just kind of a new architecture which weincidentally also use in StarCraft
 called the transformer which is a very popular paper from last year whichyielded very nice result in machine
 translation and if you actually believe in this kind of or it's actually a setof pixels as long as you encode X Y it's
 okay then you you could argue that the listof units that we see is precisely that
 because we have each unit as a kind of pixel if you will and then there XYcoordinates so in that perspective we
 without knowing it we use the same architecture that was shown to work verywell on Pascal on image net and so on so


Speaker 1 :the interesting thing here is putting it
 in that way it starts to move it towards the way you usually work with languageso what and especially with your
 expertise and work in language it seems like there's echoes of a lot of the wayyou would work with natural language in
 the way you've approached alpha star right what's does that help with thelong term sequence modeling there


Speaker 0 :somehow exactly so so now that we
 understand what an observation for a given time step is we need to move on tosay well there's going to be a sequence
 of such observations and an agent will need to given all that it's seen notonly the current time step but all that
 it's seen why because there is partial observability we must remember whetherwe saw a worker going somewhere for
 instance right because then there might be an expansion and the top right of themap so given that what you must then
 think about is there is the problem of given all the observations you have topredict the next action and not only
 given all the observations but given all the observations and given all theactions you've taken predict the next
 action and that sounds exactly like machine translation where and that'sexactly how kind of I saw the problem
 especially when you are given supervised data or replays from humans because theproblem is exactly the same you're
 translating essentially a prefix of observations and actions onto what'sgoing to happen next which is exactly
 how you would train a model to translate or to generate language as well rightyou have a certain prefix you must
 remember everything that comes in the past because otherwise you might starthaving noncoherent text and the same
 architectures we're using LST MS and transformers to operate on across timeto kind of integrate all that's
 happening in the past those architectures that work so well intranslation or language modeling are
 exactly the same than what the agent is using to issue actions in the game andthe way we train in moreover for
 imitation which is step one of alpha studies take all the human experienceand try to imitate it much like you try
 to imitate translators that translated many pairs of sentences from French toEnglish say that sort of principle
 applies exactly the same it's you mightyou it's almost the same codeexcept that instead of words you have a
 slightly more complicated objects which are the observations and the actions arealso a bit more complicated that than


Speaker 1 :award is there a self play component
 into so once you run out of imitation

Speaker 0 :right so so indeed you can bootstrap
 from human replays but then the agents you get are actually not as good as thehumans you imitated right so how do you
 imitate well we take humans from 3,000 MMR and hire 3,000 MMR is just a metricof human skill and 3,000 MMR might be
 like 50% percentile right so it's just Kevin average human what's that so maybe

Speaker 1 :quick pause MMR's ranking scale the
 matchmaking rating yeah for players so street uh remember there's like a masterand a grandmaster with 3000 so 3,000 is


Speaker 0 :is pretty bad I think it's kind of gold


Speaker 1 :level it just sounds really good
 relative to chess I think oh yeah I know

Speaker 0 :the the rating is the best in the world
 are at 7,000 mm so 3,000 it's a bit like Eloy indeedright so 3,300 just allows us to not
 filter a lot of the data so we like to have a lot of data in deep learning asyou probably know so we take these kind
 of 3,500 and above but then we do a very interesting trick which is we tell theneural network what level they are
 imitating so we say these replay you're gonna try to imitate to predict the nextaction for all the actions that you're
 gonna see is a 4,000 mm our replay this one is a 6,000 mm our replay and whatwhat's cool about this is then we take
 this policy that is being trained from human and then we can ask it to playlike a 3,000 mm our player by setting a
 bit saying well okay play like a 3,000 mm our player or play like a 6,000 mmour player and you actually see how the
 policy behaves differently it gets worse economy if you play like agold level player it does less actions
 per minute which is the number of clicks or number of actions that you will issuein a whole minute and it's very
 interesting to see that it kind of imitates the skill level quite well butif we ask you to play like a 6000 mm our
 player we tested of course these policies tosee how well they do they actually beat
 all the built-in ai's that these are put in the game but they're nowhere near6000 mm our players right they might be
 maybe around gold level platinum perhaps so there's still a lotof work to be done for the policy to
 truly understand what it means to win so far we only asked them ok here is thescreen and that's what happened on the
 game until this point what would the next action be that we asked you know weasked a pro - now say all this you're
 gonna click here or here or there and the point is experiencing experiencingwins and losses is very important to
 then start to refine otherwise the policy can get loose can can just go off

Speaker 1 :policy as we call it that's so
 interesting you can at least hope eventually to be able to control apolicy approximately to be a some MMR
 level that's that's so interesting especially given that you have groundtruth for a lot of these cases right can
 ask your personal questions or what's your mmm

Speaker 0 :well I haven't played Starcraft 2 so I
 am unranked oh is the kind of Lois League okay so I used to play Starcraftthe first one and but you haven't


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :seriously played so the best player we
 have a deep mind is about five thousand MMR which is high masters is not atGrandmaster level
 Grandmaster level would be the top 200 players in a certain region like Europeor America or Asia but for me it would
 be hard to say I am very bad at the game I actually played alpha star a bit toolate and it bit me I remember the whole
 team was Oreo you should play yeah and I was it looks like it's not so good yetand then I remember I kind of got busy
 and waited an extra week and I played and it really beat mevery badly was it I've heard that feel


Speaker 1 :it's not an amazing feelings amazing


Speaker 0 :yeah I mean obviously I tried my best
 and I try to also impress my because I actually played the first game so I'mstill pretty good at micromanagement
 um the promise I just don't understand Starcraft 2 I understand Starcraft andwhen I played Starcraft I probably was
 consistently like for for a couple years top 32 in Europe so I was decent but atthe time we didn't have this kind of MMR
 system as as well established so it would be hard to know what what it wasback then so what's the difference in


Speaker 1 :interface between alpha star and
 Starcraft and a human player and Starcraft is there any significantdifferences between the way they both


Speaker 0 :see the game I would say the way they
 see the game there's a few things that are just very hard to simulate the mainone perhaps which is obvious in
 hindsight is what's called cloaked units which are invisible units so inStarCraft you can make some units that
 you need to have a particular kind of unit to detect it so these units areinvisible
 if you cannot detect them you cannot target them so they would just you knowdestroy your buildings or kill your
 workers but despite the fact you cannot target theunit there's a shimmer that as a human
 you observe I mean you need to train a little bit you need to pay attention butyou would see this kind of space-time as
 space-time like distortion and you wouldn't know okay there art yeah yeahit's like a wave thing yeah she's kinda
 storsch I don't like it that's really like the Blizzard term is shimmershimmer and so this shimmer professional
 players actually can see it immediately they understand it very well but it'sstill something that requires certain
 amount of attention and and and it's kind of a bit annoying to deal withwhereas four alpha star in terms of
 vision it's very hard for us to simulate sort ofyou know are you looking at these pixel
 in the screen and so on so um the only thing we can do is we there is a unitthat's invisible over there so alpha
 star would know that immediately obviously still obeys the rules youcannot attack the unit you must have a
 detector and so on but it's it's kind of one of the main things that it justdoesn't feel there's there's a very
 proper way I mean you could imagine are you you don't have high present knowexactly where it is or sometimes you see
 it sometimes you don't but it's it's just really really complicated to get itso that everyone would agree oh that's
 that's the best way to simulate this right you know it seems like a

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :perception problem it is a perception
 problem so so the only problem is people are you ask what's the differencebetween how humans perceive the game I
 would say they wouldn't be able to tell a shimmer immediately as it appears onthe screen
 whereas alpha star in principal sees it very sharply right it seems okay it seesthat the beat turned from zero to one
 meaning there's now a unit there although you don't know the unit or youdon't know it you know you know that you
 cannot attack it and so on God so that from from a vision standpoint thatprobably is the one that is kind of the
 most obvious one then there are things humans cannot do perfectly evenprofessionals which is they might miss a
 detail or they might have not seen a unit and obviously as a computer ifthere's a corner of the screen that
 turns green because a unit enters the field of view that can go into thememory of the agent the lsdm and Percy's
 there for a while for whatever for however long is

Speaker 1 :relevant right and in terms of action it
 seems like the rate of action from an alpha star is comparative if not slowerthan professional players but is there
 but it's more precise as well right so

Speaker 0 :so that's that's a very like that's
 really probably the one that is causing us more issues for a couple of reasonsright
 the first one is Starcraft has been an AI environment for quite a few years infact I mean I was participating in the
 very first competition back in 2010 and there's really not been a kind of a veryclear set of rules how the actions per
 minute the rate of actions that you can issue is and as a result these agents orbots that people build in a kind of
 almost very cool way they do like 20,000 40,000 actions per minute now now to putthis in perspective a very good
 professional human my du 300 to 800 actions per minute they might not be asprecise that's why the range is a bit
 tricky to to identify exactly I mean 300 actions per minute precisely is probablyrealistic 800 is probably not but you
 see humans doing a lot of actions because they warm up and they kind ofselect things and spam and so on just so
 that when they need they have the accuracy so we came into this by nothaving kind of a standard way to say
 well how do we measure whether an agent is at human level or not on the otherhand we had a huge advantage which is
 because we do imitation learning agents turned out to act like humans in termsof rate of actions even Precision's and
 imprecisions of actions in the supervise policy you could see all this you couldsee how agents like to spam click to
 move here if you played specially Diablo you would know what I mean I mean youjust duck like spam or a move here
 Murphy a move here you're doing literally like maybe five actions in twoseconds but these actions are not very
 meaning meaningful one would have sufficed so on the one hand we startfrom this imitation policy that is at
 the ballpark of the actions per millions of humans because it actsstatistically trying to imitate humans
 so we see these very nicely in the curves that we showed in the blog postlike this these actions per minute and
 the distribution looks very human-like but then of course as self play kicks inand and that's the part we haven't
 talked too much yet but of course the agent must played getting itself toimprove then there's almost no
 guarantees that these actions will not become more precise or even the rate ofactions is going to increase over them
 so what we did and this is probably kind of the first attempt that we thought wasreasonable is we looked at the
 distribution of actions for humans for certain windows of time and just to givea perspective because I guess I
 mentioned that some of these agents that are programmatic let's call them they do40,000 actions per minute professionals
 as I said to 300 to 800 so what we looked is we look at a distribution overprofessional gamers and we took
 reasonably high actions per minute but we kind of identify certain cat offsafter which if even if the agent wanted
 to act these actions would be dropped but the problem is this cutoff isprobably set a bit too high and what
 ends up happening even though the games and when we ask the professionals andthe gamers by by and large they feel
 like it's playing human-like there are some Asians that developed maybeslightly too high a PMS which is actions
 per minute combined with the precision which made people sort of startdiscussing a very interesting issue
 which is should we have limited these should we just let it loose and see whatcool things it can come up with right so
 this is in itself an extremely interesting question but the same waythat modeling the shimmer would be so
 difficult modeling absolutely all the detailsabout muscles and precision and an
 tiredness of humans would be quite difficult right so we're here in kind ofinnovating in this sense of okay what
 could be maybe the next iteration of putting more rules that makes the agentsmore human-like in terms of restrictions


Speaker 1 :yeah putting constraints that more
 constraints yeah that's really interesting that's really innovative soone of the constraints you put on your
 on yourself or at least focused in is on the protoss race as far as I understandcan you tell me about the different
 races and how they so protoss terran and the Zerg how do they compare how do theyinteract why did you choose Protoss in
 right there is in the dynamics of the game you seen from a strategic

Speaker 0 :perspective so Protoss so in stacked of
 there are three races indeed in the demonstration we saw only the Protossrace so maybe let's start with that one
 Protoss is kind of the most technologically advanced race it hasunits that are expensive but powerful
 right so in general you want to kind of conserve your units as you go attack soyou wanna and and then you want to
 utilize these tactical advantages of very fancy spells and so on so forth andat the same time they're kind of people
 say like they're they're a bit easier to play perhaps right but that I actuallydidn't know I mean I just talked to now
 a lot to the players that we we work with TLO and mana and they said oh yeahProtoss is actually people think is
 actually one of the easiest races so perhaps the easier that doesn't meanthat it's you know obviously
 professional players excel at the three races and there's never like a race thatdominates for a very long time anyway so


Speaker 1 :if you look at the top and 100 in the
 world is there one race that dominates

Speaker 0 :that list it would be hard to know
 because it depends on the regions I think it's pretty equal in terms ofdistribution and Blizzard wants it to be
 equal right they don't want they wouldn't want one race like Protoss tonot be representative in the top place
 so definitely like they tried it to be like the balance right so then maybe theopposite race of Protoss is zerk dirt is
 a race where you just kind of expand and take over as many resources as you canand they have a very high capacity to
 regenerate their units so if you have an army it's not that valuable in terms oflosing the whole army is not a big deal
 azarkh because you can then rebuild it and given that you generally accumulatea huge Bank of resources zurk steep it
 will play by a prayer applying a lot of pressure may be losing their whole armybut then rebuilding it quickly so
 although of course every race I mean there is never I mean they're prettydiverse I mean there's some unity insert
 that are technologically advanced and they do some very interesting spells andthere's some units in proto's that are
 less valuable and you could lose a lot of them and rebuild them and it wouldn't

Speaker 1 :be a big deal all right so maybe I'm
 missing out maybe I'm gonna say some dumb stuff but just summary of strategyso first there's collection of a lot of
 resources right so that's one option the other one is expanding so building otherbasins then the other is obviously
 attack ability building units and attacking with those units and then Idon't know what else there is maybe
 there is the different timing of attacks like to attack early attack ready whatare the different strategies that
 emerged that you've learned about I've read the a bunch of people are superhappy that you guys have apparently that
 alpha star apparently is discovered that's really good too what is itsaturate oh yeah they're mind-numbing


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :online yeah the mineralogist yeah yeah
 the in it for greedy amateur players like myself that's always been a goodstrategy you just build up a lot of
 money and it just feels good it's just accumulate and accumulate so thank youfor discovering that yeah validating all
 of us but is there other strategies that you discovered interesting yeah unique

Speaker 0 :to to this game yeah so if you look at
 the kind of not being a stack of two player but of course Starcraft andStarcraft 2 and realtime strategy games
 in general are very similar I would classify perhaps the openings of thegame they're very important and
 generally I would say there's two kinds of openings one that's a standardopening that's generally how players
 find sort of a balance between risk andeconomy and building some you needs
 early on so that they could defend but they're not to expose basically but alsoexpanding quite quickly so this is would
 be kind of a standard opening and within a standard opening then you what you dochoose general is what technology are
 you aiming towards so there's a bit of rock-paper-scissors of you could go forspaceships or you could go for invisible
 units or you could go for I don't know like massive units that attack againstcertain kinds of units but they're weak
 against others so standard openings themselves have some choices likerock-paper-scissors style of course if
 you Scout and you're good at guessing what the opponent is doing then you canplane as an advantage because if you
 know you're gonna play rock I mean I'm gonna play paper obviously so you canimagine that normal standard games in
 StarCraft looks like a continuous rock paper scissor game where you guess whatthe distribution of rock paper and
 scissor is from the enemy and reacting accordingly to try to beat it or youknow put the paper out before he kind of
 changes his mind from rock to scissors and then you would be in a weak position

Speaker 1 :so sorry to pause on that I didn't
 realize this element cuz I know it's true but poker I know I looked atLambrakis
 you're this is so you're also estimating trying to guess the distribution tobetter and better estimate the
 distribution what the Epona's likely to

Speaker 0 :be doing yeah I mean as a player you
 definitely want to have a belief state over what's up on the other side of themap and when your belief state becomes
 inaccurate when you start having that serious doubts whether he's gonna playsomething that you must know that's when
 you scout you wanna then gather

Speaker 1 :information right it's improving the
 accuracy of the belief or improving the belief state part of the loss that youtry to optimize or is it just in a side


Speaker 0 :effect it's implicit but you could
 explicitly model it and it would be quite good that's probably predictingwhat's on the other side of the map but
 so far it's all implicit the lot there's no no additional reward for predictingthe enemy so there's these standard
 opening x' and then there's what people callwhich is very interesting and alpha star
 sometimes really likes this kind of cheese these cheese's what they are iskind of an all-in strategy you're gonna
 do something sneaky you're gonna hide enemies as hide your own buildings closeto the enemy base or you're gonna go for
 hiding your technological buildings so that you do invisible units and theenemy just cannot react to detect it and
 does lose the game and there's quite a few of these cheeses and variants ofthem and there is where actually the
 belief state becomes even more important because if I spelled your base and I seeno buildings at all any human prayer
 knows something's up they might know well you're hiding something close to mybase should I build suddenly a lot of
 units to defend should I actually block my ramp with workers so that you cannotcome and destroy my base so there's all
 these is happening and defending against Jesus is extremely important and in thealpha star League many agents actually
 develop some cheesy strategies and in the games we saw against elo and manatwo out of the ten agents were actually
 doing these kind of strategies which are cheesy strategies and then there's abaron of cheesy strategy which is called
 all-in so an all-in strategy is not perhaps as drastic as oh I'm gonna buildcannons on your base and then bring all
 my workers and try to just disrupt your base and game over or GG as we say inStarCraft umm there's these kind of very
 cool things that you can align precisely at a certain time mark so for instanceyou can generate exactly ten unit
 composition that is perfectly five of these type five of disorder type andalign the upgrade so that at four
 minutes and a half let's say you have these ten units and the upgrade justfinished and at that point that army is
 really scary and unless the enemy really knows what's going onif you push you might then have an
 advantage because maybe the enemy is doing something more standard itexpanded too much it developed too much
 economy and any trade-off badly against having defenses and the enemy will losebut it's called all-in because if you
 don't win then you're gonna lose so you see players that do these kind ofstrategies if they don't succeed game is
 not over I mean they still have a place and they still gathering minerals butthey will just gg out of the game
 because they know well game is over I gambled and I failedso if we start entering the game
 theoretic aspects of the game it's really rich and it's really that's whyit also makes it quite entertaining to
 watch even if I don't play I still enjoy watching the game but the agents aretrying to do this mostly implicitly but
 one element that we improved in self plays creating the alpha star League andthe alpha star League is not pure self
 play it's trying to create different personalities of agents so that some ofthem will become cheese cheese agents
 some of them might become very economical very greedy like getting allthe resources but then being maybe early
 on they're gonna be weak but later on they're gonna be very strong and bycreating this personality of agents
 which sometimes it just happens naturally that you can see kind of anevolution of agents that given the
 previous generation they trained against all of them and then they generate kindof the count the perfect counter to that
 distribution but these these agents you must have them in the populationsbecause if you don't have them you're
 not covered against these things right it's kind of you wanna you wanna youknow create all sorts of the opponents
 that you will find in the wild so you can be exposed to these cheeses earlyaggression later aggression more
 expansions dropping units in your base from the side all these things and pureself play is getting a bit stack at
 finding some subset of these but not all of these so the alpha star League is away to kind of do an example of agents
 that they're all playing and in a league much like people play on battlenet rightthey play you play against someone who
 does a new cool strategy and you immediately oh my god I want to try it Iwant to play again and these to me was
 another critical part of the of the of the problem which was can we create abattlenet for agents yeah that's kind of
 what the Alpha star league is really

Speaker 1 :fascinating and where they stick to
 their different strategies yeah wow that'sit's really really interesting so but
 that said you were fortunate enough or just skilled enough to win 5-0 and sohow hard is it to win I mean that's not
 the goal I guess I don't know what the goal is the goal should be to a majoritynot five zero but how hard is it in
 general to win all matchups

Speaker 0 :I don't want 1v1 so that's a very
 interesting question because once you see alpha star and superficially youthink well locate one
 let's if you some of the games like ten to one right it lost the game that itplayed with the camera interface you
 might think well that's that's done right there's it's it's super human atthe game and that's not really the claim
 we really can make actually the claim is we beat a professional gamer for thefirst time Starcraft has really been a
 thing that it's been going on for a few years but moment a moment like thishasn't not had not occurred before yet
 but our decisions impossible to beat absolutely not right so that's a bitwhat's you know kind of that the
 difference is the agents play at Grandmaster level there definitelyunderstand the game enough to play
 extremely well but are they am beatable do they play perfect no and actually inStarCraft because of these sneaky
 strategies it's always possible that you might take a huge risk sometimes but youmight get wins right out of out of this
 so I think that as a domain it still has a lot of opportunities not only becauseof course we want to learn with less
 experience we would like to I mean if I if I learn to play Protoss I can playturn and learn it much quicker than
 alpha star can right so there are obvious interesting research challengesas well but even as as the raw like as
 the raw performance goes really the claim here can be we are at pro level orat high Grandmaster level but obviously
 the players also did not know what to expect right this kind of their priordistribution was a bit off because they
 played this kind of new like alien brain as they like to say drive andthat's what makes it exciting for them
 but also I think if you look at the games closely you see there wereweaknesses in some points maybe alpha
 star did not scout or if it had got invisible units going against at certainpoints it wouldn't have known and it
 would have been bad so there's still quite a lot of work to do but it'sreally a very exciting moment for us to
 be seeing Wow a single neural net on a GPU is actually playing against theseguys who are amazing I mean you have to
 see them play in life if they're really really amazing players yeah I'm sure

Speaker 1 :there's there's the most there must be a
 guy in Poland somewhere right now training his butt off to make sure thatthis never happens again with alpha star
 so that's really exciting in terms of alpha star having some holes to exploityeah it's just great and then you build
 on top of each other and it feels like Starcraft I'll like go even if you winit's still not there it's still not
 there's so many different dimensions in which you can explore so that's reallyreally interesting do you think there's
 a ceiling to alpha star you've said that it hasn't reached you know it's this isa big wait what you know let me actually
 just pause for a second how did it feel to come here to this point to beat a topprofessional player like that night I
 mean you know Olympic athletes have their gold medal right this is your goldmedal and sense sure you're cited a lot
 you published a lot of prestige papers whatever but this is like a win

Speaker 0 :how did it feel I mean it was for me was
 unbelievable because first the win itself me was so exciting I mean d solooking back to those last days of 2018
 really well that's when the games were played I'm sure I look back at thatmoment I say oh my god I want to be it
 like in a project like that it's like I already feel the nostalgia of like yeahthat was huge in terms of the energy and
 the team effort that went into it and so in that sense as soon as it happened Ialready knew it was kind of I was losing
 it a little bit so it is almost like sad that it happened and alllike but on the other hand it also
 verifies the approach but to me also there's so many challenges andinteresting aspects of intelligence that
 even though we can train a neural network to play at the level of the besthumans there's still so many challenges
 so for me it's also like well this is really an amazing achievement but Ialready was also thinking about next
 steps I mean as I said these agents play Protoss vs. Protoss but they should beable to play a different race much
 quicker right so that would be an amazing achievement some people callthis matter reinforcement learning meta
 learning and so on right so there's so many possibilities after that moment butthe moment itself it really felt great
 it's I we had this bet so I I'm kind of a pessimist in general so I kind of sendan email to the team and said okay let's
 again steal offers right like what's gonna be the result and I really thoughtwe would lose like five zero right III
 we had some calibration made against the 5000 MMR player TLO was much strongerthan that player even if he played
 Protoss which is his off race but yeah I was not imagining we would win so for methat was just kind of a test run or
 something and then it really kind of he was really surprised and unbelievably wewent to this to this bar to celebrate
 and and dave tells me well why don't we invite someone who is a thousand mm arestronger in proto's like an actual
 Protoss player like like that it turned up being man all right and you know wehad some drinks and I said sure why not
 but then I thought well that's really gonna be impossible to beat I mean evenbecause it's so much I had a thousand
 MMR is really like 99% probability that mana would beat TLO as Protoss vs.Protoss right so we did that and to me
 the second the second game was much more important even though a lot ofuncertainty kind of disappeared after we
 we cannot beat the yellow I mean it he is a professional player so that waskind of over that's really a very nice
 achievement but mana really was at the top and youcould see he played much better but our
 agents got much better too so it's a and then after the first game I said if wetake a single game at least we can say
 we beat a game I mean even if we don't beat the series for me that was a hugerelief and I mean I remember hugging
 them is and I mean it was it was really like this moment for me will resonateforever as a researcher and I mean as a
 person and is a really like great accomplishment and it was great also tobe there with the team in the room I
 don't know if you saw like so it was really like I mean from my perspective

Speaker 1 :the other interesting thing is just like
 watching Kasparov watching mana was also interesting because he didn't he is kindof a loss of words I mean whenever you
 lose I've done a lot of sports you sometimes say excuses you look forreasons right and he couldn't really
 come up with a reason yeah yeah I mean so with the off race for Protoss youcould say it was it felt awkward it
 wasn't but here it was yeah it was it was just beaten and it was beautiful tolook at a human being being superseded
 by an AI system I mean it's a it's a beautiful moment for researchers so yeah

Speaker 0 :for sure it was it was I mean probably
 the highlight of my career so far because of its uniqueness and coolnessand I don't know I mean it's obviously
 as you said you can look at paper citations and so on but these thesereally is like a testament of the whole
 machine learning approach and using games to advance technology I mean it'sreally it really was everything came
 together at that moment that that's really the summary also on the other

Speaker 1 :side it's a popularization of AI too
 because just like traveling to to the moon and so on I mean this is where avery large community of people that
 don't really and no way I get to really interact with it which is very important

Speaker 0 :I mean it's really we must you know
 writing papers helps our peers researchers to understand what we'redoing but I think AI is becoming mature
 enough that we must sort of try to explain what it is and perhaps throughgames is an obvious way because these
 games always had built so it may be everyone experience an AIplaying a video game even if they don't
 know because there's always some scripted element and some people mighteven call that AI already right so what


Speaker 1 :are other applications of the approaches
 underlying alpha star that you see happening there's a lot of echoes of hesaid transformer of language modeling so
 on have you already started thinking where the breakthroughs in alpha starget expanded to other applications right


Speaker 0 :so I thought about a few things for like
 kind of next months next year's the main thing I'm thinking about actually iswhat's next as a kind of a grand
 challenge because for me like we've seen Atari and then there's like the sort ofthree-dimensional worlds that we've seen
 also like pretty good performance from these capture-the-flagagents that also some people at deep
 mine and elsewhere are working on we've also seen some amazing results on likefor instance dota 2 which is also a very
 complicated game so for me like the main thing I'm thinking about is what's nextin terms of challenge so as a researcher
 I see sort of two tensions between research and then applications or areasor domains where you apply them so on
 the one hand we've done thanks to the application of StarCraft is very hard wedevelop some techniques some new
 research that now we could look at elsewhere like are there otherapplications where we can apply this and
 the obvious ones absolutely you can think of feeding back to sort of thecommunity we took from which was mostly
 sequence modeling or natural language processing so we've developed anextended things from the transformer and
 and we use pointer networks we combine LSD and transformers in interesting waysso that perhaps the kind of lowest
 hanging fruit of feeding back to now different fields of machine learningthat's not playing video games let me go


Speaker 1 :old-school and jump to the
 to mr. Alan Turing yeah so the Turing test you know there's a natural languagetest the conversational test what's your
 thought of it as a test for intelligence do you think it is a grand challengethat's worthy of undertaking maybe if it
 is would you reformulate it or phrase it somehow differently right so I really

Speaker 0 :love the Turing test because I also like
 sequences and language understanding and in fact some of the early work we did inmachine translation we tried to apply to
 apply to kind of a neural chat bot which obviously would never pass the Turingtest because it was very limited but it
 is a very fascinating fascinating idea that you could really have an AI thatwould be indistinguishable from humans
 in terms of asking or conversing with with it right so I think the test itselfseems very nice and it's kind of well
 defined actually like the passing it or not I think there's quite a few rulesthat feel like pretty simple and and and
 you know you could you could really like have I mean I think they have thesecompetitions every year yes of the


Speaker 1 :laudner prize but I don't know if you've
 seen a I don't know if you've seen the

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :kind of bots that emerge from that
 competition they're not quite as what you would so it feels like that there'sweaknesses with the way tauren
 formulated it it needs to be that the definition of a genuine rich fulfillinghuman conversation it needs to be
 something else like the Alexa prize which I'm not as well familiar with hastried to define that more I think by
 saying you have to continue keeping a conversation for 30 minutes somethinglike that
 so basically forcing the agent not to just fool but to have an engagingconversation kind of thing is that I
 mean is is this have you thought about this problem richly like as and if ifyou have in general how how far away are
 we from you worked a lot on language understanding language generation butthe full dialogue the conversation you
 know just sitting at the bar having a couple of beers for an hour and thatkind of conversation have you thought


Speaker 0 :about yeah so I think you touched here
 on the critical point which is feasibility right so so there's there'sa great sort of essay by Hamming which
 describes sort of grand challenges of physics and he argues that well okay forinstance teleportation or time travel
 our great grand challenges of physics but there's no attacks we really don'tknow or cannot kind of make any progress
 so that's why most physicists and so on they don't work on these in their PhDsand and as part of their careers so I
 see the Turing test as I in the full Turing test as a bit still too earlylike I am I think we're especially with
 the current trend of deep learning language models we've seen some amazingexamples I think GPD to being the most
 recent one which is very impressive but to understand to fully solve passing orfooling a human to think that you're
 that there's a human on the other side I think we're quite far so as a result Idon't see myself and I probably would
 not recommend people doing a PhD on solving the Turing test because it justfeels it's kind of too early or too hard
 of a problem yeah but that said you said

Speaker 1 :the exact same thing about Starcraft
 about a few years ago so into damage so

Speaker 0 :I prefer yeah you'll probably also be


Speaker 1 :the person who passes the Turing test in


Speaker 0 :three years I mean I think I think that
 yeah so so we have the Sun record this

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :is nice it's really I mean that the it's
 true that progress sometimes is a bit unpredictable I really wouldn't have noteven six months ago I would not have
 predicted the level that we see that these agents can deliver at Grandmasterlevel but I I have worked on language
 enough and basically my concern is not that something could happen abreakthrough could happen that would
 bring us to solving or passing the Turing test is that I just think thestatistical approach to it like this it
 is not is not gonna cut it so we need we need the breakthrough weis great for the community but given
 that I think there's quite a more uncertainty whereas for StarCraft I knewwhat the steps would be to kind of get
 us there I think it was clear that using the imitation learning part and thenusing these battlenet for agents were
 gonna be key and and it turned out that this was the case and a little more wasneeded but not much more for Turing test
 I just don't know what the plan or execution plan would look like so that'swhy I'm I myself working on it as a
 grand challenge is hard but there are quite a few sub challenges that arerelated that you could say well I mean
 what if you create a great assistant like Google already has like the Googleassistant so can we make it better and
 can we make it fully new role and so on that I start to believe maybe we'rereaching a point where we should attempt
 these challenges like this conversation

Speaker 1 :so much because the echo is very much to
 start a conversation it's exactly how you approach StarCraft let's break itdown into small pieces solve those and
 you end up solving the whole game great but that said you you're behind some ofthe sort of biggest pieces of work and
 deep learning in the last several years so you mentioned some limits what do youthink of the current limits of deep
 learning and how do we overcome those

Speaker 0 :limits so if I had to actually use a
 single word to define the main challenge in deep learning is a challenge thatprobably has been the challenge for many
 years and is that of generalization so what that means is that all that we'redoing is fitting functions to data and
 when the data we see is not from the same distribution or even if there sometimes that it is very close to
 distribution but because of the way we train it with limited samples we thenget to this stage where we just don't
 see generalization as much as we can generalize and I think adversarialexamples are a clear example of these
 but if you study machine learning and literature and you know the reason whyas VMs came very popular where because
 they were dealing and they had some guarantees about generalizationwhich is unseen data or out of
 distribution or even within distribution where you take an image adding a bit ofnoise
 these models fail so I think really I don't see a lot of progress ongeneralization in in the strong
 generalization sense of the word I I think our neuron neural networks you canalways find design examples that will
 make their outputs arbitrary which is which which is not good because wehumans would never be fooled by these
 kind of images or manipulation of the image and if you look at the mathematicsyou kind of understand this is a bunch
 of matrices multiplied together there's probably numerix and instabilitythat you can just find corner cases so I
 think that's really the underlying topic many times we see when even even at thegrand stage of like doing test
 generalization I mean if used if you startI mean passing the Turing test should
 you should it be in English or should it be in any language right I mean as ahuman if you could you could if you ask
 something in a different language you actually will go and do some researchand try to translate it and so on
 shoot the Turing test in clementa include that right and it's really adifficult problem and very fascinating
 and very mysterious actually yeah

Speaker 1 :absolutely but do you think it's if you
 were to try to solve it can you not grow the size of data intelligently in such away that the distribution of your
 training set does include the entirety of the testing set I think is that onepath the other path is totally new
 methodology right it's not statistical

Speaker 0 :so a path that has worked well and it
 worked well in in stark Ravin in machine translation and in languages scaling upthe data and the model and that's kind
 of been maybe the only single formula that the leap still delivers today indeep learning right it's it's that scale
 data scale and model scale really do more and more of the things that wethought oh there's no way it can
 generalize to these Ori there's no way it can generalize to that but I don'tthink fundamentally it
 resolve with these and for instance I'm really liking some style or approachthat would not only have neural networks
 but it would have programs or some discrete decision-making because thereis what I feel there's a bit more like
 like I mean the example of the best example I think for understandingdisease I also worked a bit on or like
 we can learn an algorithm with a neural network right so you give it manyexamples and it's going to sort your
 sort the input numbers or something like that but really strong generalization isyou give me some numbers or you ask me
 to create an algorithm that sorts numbers and instead of creating a neuralnet which will be fragile because it's
 gonna go out of range at some point you're gonna give you numbers that aretoo large to small and whatnot
 you just if you just create a piece of code that sorts the numbers then you canprove that that will generalize to
 absolutely all the possible inputs you could give so I think that's the problemcomes with some exciting prospects I
 mean scale is a bit more boring but it really works and then maybe programs andthese critics tractions are a bit less
 developed but clearly I think they're quite exciting in terms of future for

Speaker 1 :the field do you draw any insight wisdom
 from the 80s and expert systems and symbolic systems about computing do youever go back to those reasoning that
 kind of logic do you think that might make a comeback you have to dust off

Speaker 0 :those books yeah I actually love
 actually adding more inductive biases to me the problem really is what are youtrying to solve if what you're trying to
 solve is so important that try to solve it no matter what then absolutely userules use domain knowledge and then use
 a bit of the magic of machine learning to empower to make the system as thebest system that will detect cancer or
 you know or detect weather patterns right or in terms of start of it alsowas a very big challenge so I was
 definitely happy that if we had to get take cut a corner here and there itcould have been
 interesting to do and in fact in StarCraft we we start thinking aboutexpert systems because it's very you
 know you can define I mean people actually build stack reports by thinkingabout those principal I guess you know
 state machines and rule-based and then you could you could think of combining abit of a rule-based system but that has
 also neural networks incorporated to make it generalize a bit better soabsolutely I mean we should we should
 definitely go back to those ideas and anything that makes the problem simpleras long as your problem is important
 that's okay and that's research driving a very important problem and on theother hand if you wanna really focus on
 the limits of reinforcement learning then of course you must try not to lookat imitation data or to look some like
 for some rules of the domain that would help a lot or even feature engineeringright so these these attention that
 depending on what you do I think both both ways are definitely fine and Iwould never not do one or the other if
 you're as long as you what you're doing is important and needs to be soft rightright so there's a bunch of different


Speaker 1 :ideas that that that you develop that I
 really enjoy so but one one is translating from the image captioningtranslated finish the text just just
 another just beautiful yeah beautiful idea I think that resonates throughoutyour work actually so the underlying
 nature of reality being language always yes somehow so what's the connectionbetween images and text rather the
 visual world and the world of language

Speaker 0 :in your view right so I think a piece of
 research that's been central to I would say even extending into Starcraft is isthis idea of sequence to sequence
 learning which what we really meant by that is that you can you can now reallyinput anything to a neural network as
 the input X and then the neural network will learn a function f that will take Xas an input and produce any output Y and
 these x and y's don't need to be like static or like a features like aslike a fixed vectors or anything like
 that it could be it really sequences and now beyond like data structures right sothat paradigm was tested in a very
 interesting way when we moved from translating French to English totranslating an image to its caption but
 the beauty the beauty of it is that really and that's actually how ithappened I run I change the line of code
 in this thing that was doing machine translation I and I came the next dayand I saw how it like it was producing
 captions that seemed like oh my god this is really really working and theprinciple is the same right so I think I
 don't see text vision speech waveforms as something different here as long asyou basically learn a function that will
 vector eyes you know these into and then after we vectorize it we can then useyou know transformers LS DMS whatever
 the flavor of the month of the model is and then as long as we have enoughsupervised data really this formula will
 work and we'll keep working I believe to some extent model of thesegeneralization issues that I mentioned
 before so but the testers to vectorize

Speaker 1 :sort of former representation that's
 meaningful nothing and your intuition now having worked with all this media isthat once you are able to form that
 representation you can basically take any things any sequence is there go backto Starcraft is there limits on the
 length so we didn't really touch on a long term effect how did you overcomethe whole really long term aspect of
 things here is there some tricks or so

Speaker 0 :the main streak so Starcraft if you look
 at absolutely every frame you might think it's it's quite a long game so wewould have to multiply 22 times 60
 seconds per minute times maybe at least 10 minutes per game on average so thereare quite a few frames but the trick
 really was to only observe in fact which might be seen as a limitation butit is also computational advantage only
 observe when you act and then what the neural network decides is what is thegap gonna be until the next action and
 if you look at most Starcraft games that we have in the in the data set thatBlaser provided it turns out that most
 games are actually only I mean it is still a long sequence but it may be likea thousand to 1,500 actions which if you
 start looking at L STM's large LST M's transformers it's it's not like it's notthat that difficult especially if you
 have supervised learning if you had to do it with reinforcement learning thecredit assignment problem what is it
 that in this game that made you win that would be really difficult but thankfullybecause of imitation learning we didn't
 kind of have to deal with these directly although if we had to we tried it andwhat happen is you just take all your
 workers and attack with them and that sort of is kind of obvious in retrospectbecause you start trying random actions
 one of the actions will be a worker that goes to the enemy base and because it'sself play it's not gonna know how to
 defend because it basically doesn't know almost anything and eventually what youdevelop is this take our workers and
 attack because the the create assignment issue in Arad is really really hard I dobelieve we could do better and that's
 maybe a research challenge for the future but yeah even even in StarCraftthe sequences are maybe a thousand which
 I believe there is within the realm of what transformers can do yeah I guess

Speaker 1 :the difference between Starcraft and go
 is in go and chest stuff starts happening right away right so there'snot yeah it's pretty easy to self play
 not easy but to sulfa is possible to develop reasonable strategy as quicklyas opposed to Starcraft meaning go


Speaker 0 :there's only 400 actions but one action
 is what people would call the god action that would be if you had expanded thewhole search tree that's the best action
 if you did minimax or whatever algorithm you would do if you had thecomputational capacity
 but in StarCraft the 400 is miniscule like a in 400 you don't even like youyou couldn't even click on the pixels
 around a unit right so I think the problem there is in terms of actionspace size is way harder so and that
 surge is impossible so there's quite a few challenges indeed that make thiskind of a step step up in terms of
 machine learning for humans maybe they playing Starcraft it seemsmore intuitive because it's looks real I
 mean you know like the graphics and everything moves smoothlywhereas I I don't know how to come in go
 is a game that I wouldn't really mean to study it feels quite complicated but formachines kind of maybe easier reverse
 yes

Speaker 1 :which shows you the gap actually between
 deep learning and however the heck our brains work so you developed a lot ofreally interesting ideas it's
 interesting to just ask what's the what's your process of developing newideas
 do you like brainstorming with others do you like thinking alone do you like likewas it eating good fellow said he came
 up with Gans after a few beers right he thinks beers are essential yeah comingup with new ideas we had beers to decide


Speaker 0 :to play another game game of Starcraft
 after a week so it's really similar to that story actually I explained this ina in a deep mind retreat and I said this
 is the same as the gun story I mean we were wearing a bar and we decided let'splay again next week and that's what
 happened I feel like we're giving the

Speaker 1 :wrong message to young undergrads yeah


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :but in general like yeah do you like
 brainstorming do you like thinking alone

Speaker 0 :working stuff out and so I think I think
 throughout the years also things changed right so initially I was very fortunateto be with great minds like Geoff Hinton
 Jeff Dean Ilya sutskever I was really fortunate to join brain at a very goodtime so at that point it ideas I was
 just kind of brainstorming with my colleagues and learned a lot and keeplearning is actually something you
 should never stop doing right so learning implies reading papers and alsothese casting ideas with others it's
 very hard at some point to not communicate that being readingpaper forms from someone or actually
 discussing right so definitely that communication aspect needs to be therewhether it's written or oral nowadays
 I'm also trying to be a bit more strategic about what research to do so Iwas describing a little bit this sort of
 tension between research for the sake of research and then you have on the otherhand applications that can drive the
 research right and honestly the formula that has worked best for me is just finda hard problem and then try to see how
 research fits into it how it doesn't fit into it and then you must innovate so Ithink machine translation drove sequence
 to sequence then maybe like learning algorithms that had to likecombinatorial algorithms led to pointer
 networks Starcraft led to really scaling a permutation learning and the Alphastar league so that's been a formula
 that I personally like but the other one is also about it and I seen it succeed alot of the times where you just want to
 investigate model-based RL as a kind of a research topic and then you must thenstart to think well how are the tests
 how are you going to test these ideas you need to kind of a minimalenvironment to try things you need to
 read a lot of papers and so on and that's also very fun to do and somethingI've also done quite a few times both at
 brain at the mine and obviously as as a PhD so so I think besides that the ideasand discussions I think it's important
 also because you start sort of guiding not only your own goals but otherpeople's goes to the next breakthrough
 so you you must really kind of understand these you know feasibilityalso as we were discussing before right
 whether whether these domain is ready to be tackled or not and you don't want tobe too early you obviously don't want to
 be too late so it's it's really interesting and this is a strategiccomponent of research which I think as a
 grad student I just had no idea to you know I just read papers and discussedideas and I think this has been maybe
 the major change and I recommend people kind of feed forward to successhow it looks like and try to backtrack
 other than just kind of looking out these looks cool these looks cool andthen you do a bit of random work which
 sometimes you stumble upon some interesting things but in general it'sit's also good to plan a bit yeah I like


Speaker 1 :it
 especially like your approach I've taken a really hard problem stepping right inand then being super skeptical about


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah being robbed I mean there's a
 balance of both right there's a silly optimism and and a critical sort ofskepticism that's good to balance which
 is why it's good to have a team of people that that balance that you don't

Speaker 0 :do that on your own you have both
 mentors that have seen or you obviously wanna chat and discuss whether it's theright time I mean Demi's came in 2014
 and he said maybe in a bit we'll do starcraft and maybe he knew and that'sand I'm just following his lead which is
 great because he's he's brilliant right so these these things are obviouslyquite important that you wanna be
 surrounded by people who you know are diverse they they have their knowledgethere's also important too I mean I I've
 learned a lot from people who actually have an idea that I might not think it'sgood but if I give them the space to try
 it I've been proven wrong many many times as well so that's that's greatit's I think it's your colleagues are
 more important than yourself I think so

Speaker 1 :sure now let's real quick talk about
 another impossible problem AGI right what do you think it takes to build asystem that's human level intelligence
 we talked a little bit about the Tauranga stark after all these haveechoes of general intelligence but if
 you think about just something that you would sit back and say wow this isreally something that resembles human
 level intelligence what do you think it

Speaker 0 :takes to build that so I find that AGI
 oftentimes is maybe not by well defined so what I'm trying to then come up withfor myself is what would be a result
 look like that you would start to believe that you would haveagents or neural nets that no longer
 sort of over feet to a single task right but actually kind of learn the skill oflearning so to speak and that actually
 is a field that I am fascinated by which is the learning to learn or metalearning which is about no longer
 learning about a single domain so you can think about the learning algorithmitself is general right so the same
 formula we applied for alpha star or Starcraft we can now apply to kind ofalmost any video game or you could apply
 to many other problems and domains but the algorithm is what's kind ofgeneralizing but the neural network the
 weights those weights are useless even to play another race right I train anetwork to play very well at Protoss vs.
 Protoss I need to throw away those weights if I want to play nowterran vs terran i would need to retrain
 a network from scratch with the same algorithm that's beautifulbut the network itself will not be
 useful so I think when I if I see an approach that can observe or startsolving new problems without the need to
 kind of restart the process I think that to me would be a nice way to define someform of AGI again I don't know the grand
 views like age I mean so it should Turing test nice or before AGI I mean Idon't know I think I think concretely I
 would like to see clearly that meta learning happened meaning there there isan architecture or network that as it
 sees new new problem or new data it solves it and to make it kind of abenchmark it should solve it at the same
 speed that we do solve new problems when I define your new object and you have torecognize it when I when you start
 playing a new game you played all the times but now you play a new Atari gamewell you you're gonna be pretty quickly
 pretty good at the game so that's perhaps what's the domain and what's theexact benchmark is a bit difficult I
 think as a community we might need to do some work to define itbut I think this first step I could see
 it happen relatively soon but then the whole what a GI means and so on I am abit more confused about what I think
 people mean different things there's an

Speaker 1 :emotional psychological level that like
 the even the Turing test passing the Turing test is something that we justpassed judgment on human beings what it
 means to be you know as a as a dog in a GI system yeah like what level what doesit mean right yeah what does it mean but
 I like the generalization and maybe as a community would converge towards a groupof domains that are sufficiently far
 away that would be really damn impressive if we're able to generalizesome perhaps not as close as Protoss and
 Zerg but like Wikipedia step be a good stuff and then a really good step butthen then like Wickham Starcraft 2
 Wikipedia yeah I'm back yeah that kind

Speaker 0 :of thing and that that feels also quite
 hard and far but I think there's as long as you put the benchmark out as wediscovered for instance with image net
 then tremendous progress can be had so I think maybe there's a lack of benchmarkbut I'm sure we'll find one and yeah a
 community will will then work towards that and then beyond what a GI mightmean or would imply I really am hopeful
 to see basically machine learning or AI just scaling up and helping you knowpeople that might not have the resources
 to hire an assistant or that they might not even know what the weather is likebut you know so I think there's in terms
 of the impact the positive impact of AI I think that's maybe what we should alsonot lose focus right the research
 community building AG I mean that's a real nice girl but man I think the waythat deep mind puts it is and then use
 it to solve everything else right so I think we should paralyze yeah we

Speaker 1 :shouldn't forget about all the positive
 things that are actually coming out of it already and I are not going to becoming out right but
 that I know let me ask relative the popular perception do you have any worryabout the existential threat of
 artificial intelligence in the near or far future that some people have I think

Speaker 0 :I'm in the near future I'm I'm skeptical
 so I hope I'm not wrong but I'm I'm not concerned but I I appreciate effortsongoing efforts and even like whole
 research fields on AI safety emerging and in conferences and so on I thinkthat's great in the long term I really
 hope we just can simply have the benefits outweigh the potential dangersI am hopeful for that but also we must
 remain vigilant to kind of monitor and assess whether the trade-offs are arethere and and we have you know enough
 also lead time to prevent or to redirect our efforts if need be right so but I'mquite I'm quite optimistic about the
 technology and definitely more fearful of other threats in terms of planetarylevel at this point but obviously that's
 the one I kind of have more like power on so clearly I do start thinking moreand more about this and it's kind of
 it's groaning me actually to to start reading more about AI safety jeez afieldthat so far I have not really
 contributed to but maybe there's something to be done there as well I

Speaker 1 :think it's really important you know I
 would talk about this issue folks but it's important to ask you and shove itin your head because you're at the
 leading edge of actually what people are excited about nay I I mean the work withalpha star it it's arguably at the very
 cutting edge of the kind of thing that people are afraid of and so you speakingto that fact and that we're actually
 quite far away to the kind of thing that people might be afraid of but it's stillsomething worthwhile to think about and
 it's also good that you're the you're not as worried and you'realso open to us yeah me Maura


Speaker 0 :there's two aspects I mean me not being
 worried but obviously we should prepare for for for it right for for likeforever for things that could go wrong
 misuse of the technologies as with any technologies right so I think there'sthere's always trade-offs and I I as a
 society we've kind of solved these to some extent within the past so I'mhoping that by having the researchers
 and the whole community brainstorm and come up with interesting solutions tothe new things that will happen in the
 future that we can still also push the researchto the Avenue that I think is kind of
 the greatest Avenue which is to understand intelligence right how are wedoing what we're doing and you know
 obviously from a scientific standpoint that is kind of the drive my personaldriver of all the time that I spend
 doing what I'm doing really what do you

Speaker 1 :see the deep learning as a field heading
 what do you think the next big big breakthrough might be so I think deep

Speaker 0 :learning I I discuss a little of this
 before deep learning has to be combined with some form of discretization programsynthesis I think that's kind of as a
 research in itself is an interesting topic to expand and start doing moreresearch and then as kind of what will
 deep learning and able to do in the future I don't think that's gonna bewhat's gonna happen this year but also
 this idea of starting not to throw away all the weights that the this idea oflearning to learn and really having
 these agents not having to restart their weights and you you can have an agentthat is kind of solving or classifying
 images on image net but also generating speech if you ask it to generate somespeech and and it should really be kind
 of almost the same network but might not be a neural networking might be a neuralnetwork with a optimization algorithm
 attached to it but I think this idea of generalization to new tasks is somethingthat we first must define good
 benchmarks but then I think that's gonna be exciting and I'm notsure how close we are but I think
 there's the pet if you have a very limited domain I think we can startdoing some progress and much like how we
 did a lot of programs in computer vision we should start thinking am I reallylike a talk that gave that Leon blue to
 give gave at ICML a few years ago which is this train test paradigm should bebroken we we know we should stop
 thinking about a training test at Acharya training set and a test set andthese are closed you know things that
 are untouchable I think we should go beyond these and in meta learning wecall these the meta training set and the
 meta test set which is really thinking about if I know about imagenet why wouldthat network not work on M NIST which is
 a much simpler problem but right now it really doesn't it you know yeah and butit just feels wrong right so I think
 that's kind of the there's the on the application or the benchmark sites we weprobably will see quite a few more
 interest and progress and hopefully people defining new and excitingchallenges really do you have any hope


Speaker 1 :or interest in knowledge graphs within
 this context so just kind of totally yeah constructing graph so going backthat graphs yap well okay neural
 networks and graphs but I mean a different kind of knowledge graph sortof like semantic graphs or there's


Speaker 0 :concepts yeah so I think I think the the
 idea of graphs is is so I've been quite interested in sequences first and thenmore interesting or different data
 structures like graphs and I've studied graph narrow networks in the last threeyears or so I found these models just
 very interesting from like deep learning sites standpoint but then how what do wewant why do we want these models and and
 why would we use them what's the application what's kind of the killerapplication of graphs right and perhaps
 if we could extract a knowledge Graff from Wikipedia automatically rightum that would be interesting because
 then these graphs have this very interesting structure that also is a bitmore comfortable with this idea of
 programs and deep learning kind of working togetherthe jumping neighborhoods and so on you
 could imagine defining some primitives to go around graphs right so I think Ireally like the idea of a knowledge
 graph and in fact when we we started or you know as part of the research we didfor StarCraft I thought wouldn't it be
 cool to give the graph of you know all the prerequisites like this all thesebuildings that depend on each other and
 units that have prerequisites of being built by that and so this is informationthat the network can learn and extract
 but it would have been great to see um or to think of really stack graph as agiant graph that even also as the game
 evolves use kind of star trek taking branches and so on and we tried we reada bit of research on these nothing too
 relevant but I I really like the idea

Speaker 1 :and it has elements that are which
 something you also worked with in terms of visualizing your networks as elementsof having human interpretable being able
 to generate knowledge representations that are human interpretable that maybehuman experts can then tweak or at least
 understand so there's there's a lot of interesting aspect there and for mepersonally I'm just a huge fan of
 Wikipedia and it's it's a shame that our neural networks aren't taking advantageof all the structured knowledge that's
 on the web what's next for for you what's next for deep mind what are youexcited about what a four alpha star


Speaker 0 :yeah so I think the obvious next steps
 would be to apply alpha star to other races I mean that's sort of shows thatthe algorithm works because we wouldn't
 want to have created by mistake something in the architecture thathappens to work for Protoss but not for
 other races right so as verification I think that's an obvious next step thatwe are working on and then I would like
 to see so agents and players can specialize ondifferent skill sets that allow them to
 be very good I think we've seen alpha star understanding very well when totake battles and when to not to do that
 do that also very good at micromanagement and moving the unitsaround and so on and also very good at
 producing non-stop and trading of economy with building units but I havenot perhaps seen as much as I would like
 this idea of the poker idea that you mentioned right I'm not sure Starcraftor alpha star rather has developed a
 very deep understanding of what the opponent is doing and reacting to thatand sort of trying to to to trick the
 player to do something else or that you know so this kind of reasoning I wouldlike to see more so I think purely from
 a research standpoint there's perhaps also quite a few of you things to bedone there in the domain of StarCraft


Speaker 1 :yeah in a domain of games I've seen some
 interesting work in sort of in even auctions manipulating other players soforming a belief state and just messing
 with people yeah about theory of mind

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah yeah this is a theory of mine


Speaker 0 :on star Kirby's kind of they're really
 made for each other yeah so that would be very exciting tosee those techniques applied to
 Starcraft or perhaps Starcraft driving new techniques right as I said this isalways the tension between the two well


Speaker 1 :Oriol thank you so much for talking
 today awesome it was great to be here
