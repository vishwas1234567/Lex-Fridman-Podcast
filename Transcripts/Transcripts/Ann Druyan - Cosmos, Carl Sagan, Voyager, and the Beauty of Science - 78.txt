Speaker 0 :the following is a conversation with an


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :Julianne writer producer director and
 one of the most important and impactful communicators of science in our time sheco-wrote the 1980 science documentary
 series cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan whom she married in 1981 and her love forwhom with the help of NASA was recorded
 as brainwaves on a golden record along with other things our civilization hasto offer and launched into space on the
 Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now 42 years later still activereaching out farther into deep space
 than any human made object ever has this was a profound and beautiful decisionand made as a creative director of
 NASA's Voyager interstellar message project in 2014 she went on to createthe second season of cosmos called
 cosmos and spacetime Odyssey and in 2020 the new third season called cosmospossible worlds which is being released
 this upcoming Monday March 9th it is hosted once again by the fun and thebrilliant Neil deGrasse Tyson Carl Sagan
 Annie Julian and cosmos have inspired millions of scientists and curious mindsacross several generations by revealing
 the magic the power the beauty of science I am one such curious mind andif you listen to this podcast you may
 know that Elon Musk is as well he graciously agreed to read Carl Sagan'swords about the pale blue dot in my
 second conversation with him if you listened there was an interesting andinspiring twist at the end


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :this is the artificial intelligence
 podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it five starsan apple podcast supported on patreon
 I'll connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fri DM aen as usualI'll do one or two minutes of ads now
 and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation Ihope that works for you and doesn't hurt
 the listening experience this shows presented by cash app thenumber one finance app in the App Store
 when you get it use collects podcast cash app lets you send money to friendsbuy Bitcoin and invest in the stock
 market with as little as one dollar

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :since cash app allows you to send and
 receive money digitally peer-to-peer and security in all digital transactionsit's very important let me mention the
 PCI data security standard that cash app is compliant with I'm a big fan ofstandards for safety and security PCI
 DSS is a good example of that where a bunch of competitors got together andagreed that there needs to be a global
 standard around the security of transactions now we just need to do thesame for autonomous vehicles and
 artificial intelligence systems in general so again if you get cash appfrom the App Store Google Play and use
 the code let's podcast you get ten dollars and cash up will also donate tendollars the first one of my favorite
 organizations that's helping to advance robotics and STEM education for youngpeople around the world and now here's


Speaker 1 :my conversation with Ann Julianne what


Speaker 0 :is the role of Science in our society


Speaker 1 :well I think of what Einstein said when
 he opened the 1939 New York World's Fair he said if science is ever to fulfillits mission the way art has done it must
 penetrate its inner meaning must penetrate the consciousness of everyoneand so for me especially in a
 civilization dependent on high technology and science one thatspires to be democratic it's critical
 that the public has informed decision makers understand the values and themethods and the rules of science so you


Speaker 0 :think about the what you just mentioned
 the values and the methods and the rules and maybe the technology that scienceproduces but what about sort of the
 beauty the mystery of science well that

Speaker 1 :you've touched on what I think is for me
 that's how my way into science is that for me it's much more spirituallyuplifting the revelations of science
 collective revelations of you know really countless generations ofsearchers and a little tiny bit we know
 about reality is the greatest joy from me because I think it relates to theidea of love like what is love that is
 based on illusion about the other that's not love love is seeing unflinching theother and accepting with all your heart
 and to me knowing the universe as it is or the little bit that we're able tounderstand at this point is like is the
 purest kind of love and therefore you know how can our philosophy our religionif it's real isn't nature how can it
 really be true I just don't understand so I think you need science to get asense of the real romance of life and
 the great experience of being awake in

Speaker 0 :the cosmos so that the fact that we know
 so little the the humbling nature of that so and you kind of connect the loveto that but isn't it also isn't it scary
 isn't it why is it so inspiring do you think why is it so beautiful that weknow so little


Speaker 1 :well first of all as Socrates thought
 you know knowing that you know is knowing really knowing somethingknowing more than others and it's the
 it's that voice whispering in our our heads you know you might be wrong whichi think is not only it's really healthy
 because we're so imperfect we're human of course but also you know love to meis the feeling that you always want to
 go deeper get closer you can't get enough of it you can't get close enoughdeep enough so and that's what science
 is always saying as science is never simply content with its understanding ofany aspect of nature it's always saying
 it's always finding that even smaller cosmos beneath so I I think the two are

Speaker 0 :very much parallel so you said that love


Speaker 1 :is not an illusion no it's not well what


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :is love what is love is is knowing for
 me love is is knowing something deeply and still being completely gratified byit you know and wanting to know more so
 what is love what is loving someone a person let's say deeply is notidealizing them not putting some kind of
 subjective projection on them but knowing them as they are and so for mefor me the only aperture to that knowing
 about nature the universe it's science because it has that errorcorrecting mechanism that most of the
 stuff that we do doesn't have you know you could say the Bill of Rights is kindof an error correcting mechanism which I
 it's one of the things I really appreciate about this society in which Ilive to the extent that it's upheld and
 we keep faith with it and the same with science it's like we will give you thehighest rewards we have for proving us
 wrong about something that's genius that's that's whythat's why in only 400 years since
 Galileo's first look through a telescope we could get from this really dim fakethis big apprehension of another world
 to sending our eyes and our senses there or even going beyond so it is it is itdelivers the goods like nothing else you
 know it really it delivers the goods because it's always it's alwaysself-aware of its ability I'm not topic


Speaker 0 :I'd like to ask your opinion and a
 feeling I have that I'm not sure what to do with which is the the scepticalaspect of science so the modern skeptics
 community and just in general certain scientists many scientists maybe mostscientists that apply the scientific
 method are kind of rigorous in that application and they it feels likesometimes miss out some of the ideas
 outside the reach of just slightly outside of the reach of science and theydon't dare to sort of dream or think of
 revolutionary ideas that others will call crazy in this particular moment howdo you think about the skeptical aspect
 of science that is really good at sort of keeping us in check keeping us humblebut but at the same time sort of the
 kind of dreams that you and Carl Sagan have inspired in the world it kind ofshuts it down sometimes a little bit


Speaker 1 :yeah I mean I think it's up to the
 individual but for me no I was so ridiculously fortunate and that I mytutorial in science because I'm not a
 scientist and I wasn't trained in science was 20 years of days and nightswith Carl Sagan and the Wonder I think
 the reason Carl remains so beloved well I think there are many reasons but atthe root of it is the fact that his
 skepticism was never at the cost of his Wonder and his Wonder was never at thecost of his skepticism so he couldn't
 fool himself into believing something he wanted to believebecause it made him feel good at the
 other but on the other hand he recognized that what science what natureis it's really it's good enough you know
 it's way better than our fantasies yeah and so if you if you're that kind ofperson who loves happiness loves life
 and your eyes are wide open and you read everything you can get your hands on andyou spend years studying what is known
 so far about the universe then you have that capacity a really infinite capacityto be alive but all and also at the same
 time to be very rigorous about what you're willing to believe for Carl Idon't think he ever felt that his
 skepticism cost him anything because again it comes back to luck he wanted toknow when HM really was like not to
 inflict his you know preconceived notions on what he wanted it to be soyou can't go wrong because it doesn't
 you know I mean you know I think the pale blue dot is that is a perfectexample of this of his massive
 achievement is to say ok or the Voyager record is another example is here wehave this mission our first
 reconnaissance of the outer solar system well how can we make it a mission inwhich we absolutely squeeze every drop
 of consciousness and understanding from it we don't have to be scientists andthen be human beings I think that's the
 tragedy of Western civilization is that it's you know when it's one of itsgreatest gifts it has been science and
 yet at the same time it believing that we are the children of a disappointedfather a tyrant who puts us in a
 maximum-security prison and calls it paradise who looks at us who watches usevery moment and hates us for
 being our human selves you know and then most of all what is our great sin itspartaking of the tree of knowledge which
 is our greatest gift as humans this pattern recognition this ability to tosee things and then synthesize them and
 jump to conclusions about them and test those conclusions so I think the reasonthat in literature in movies the
 scientist is a figure of alienation a figure you know oh you see these biopicsabout scientists and yeah he might have
 been great but you know he was missing and ship you know he was a lousy husbandhe lacked you know the kind of spiritual
 understanding that maybe you know his wife had and it's always in the end theycome around but to me that's that's a
 false dichotomy that we are you know to the extent that we are aware of oursurroundings and understand them which
 is what science makes it possible for us to do we're even more alive so you

Speaker 0 :mentioned a million awesome things there
 let's even just can you tell me about the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft and theand the interstellar message project and
 that whole just fascinating world leading up to one of my favorite

Speaker 1 :subjects I love talking about it I'll
 never get over it yeah I'll never be able to really wrapmy head around the the reality of it the


Speaker 0 :truth of it what is it for so what's the
 Voyager spacecraft

Speaker 1 :okay so voyagers 1 & 2 where our first
 reconnaissance mission of what was then considered the outer solar system and itwas a gift of gravity the idea that
 swinging around these worlds gives you a gravitational assist yeswhich ultimately will send you out of
 the solar system to wander the Milky Way galaxy for one to five billion years soVoyager gave us our
 first close-up look of Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune it's discovered new moonsit discovered volcanoes on Io it it its
 achievements are astonishing and remember this is technology from theearly to mid-1970s and it's still active


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and it's still active we talked to
 Voyager a few days ago we talked to it in fact a year ago I think it was weneeded to slightly change the attitude
 of the spacecraft and so we fired up its thrusters for the first time since 1987do they work instantly they it was as if
 you had left your car in the garage in 1987 yeah and you could key in theignition because you use keys then in
 the ignition and it turned over the first time you stepped on the gas and sothat's the genius of the engineering
 yeah a Voyager and Carl was one of the key participants in in in imagining whatits mission would be because it was a a
 gift actually of the fact that every hundred and 75 years plus or minus thereis an alignment of the worlds and so you
 can't send two spacecraft to these are the worlds and photograph them and useyour mass spectrometer and all the other
 devices unvoyage ER to to really to explore these worlds and it's the

Speaker 0 :farthest spacecraft is the farthest
 human creation away from us today where

Speaker 1 :is your one where's your one these two
 spacecraft not only gave us a our first close-up look hundreds of moons andplanets these four giant these planets
 but also it told us the shape of the solar system as it moves through thegalaxy because there were two of them
 going in different directions and they finally and they arrived in aplace called the heliopause which is
 where the wind from the Sun the solar wind dies down and the interstellarmedium begins and both voyagers were the
 first spacecraft that we had they could tell us when that happened so it's aconsummate I think it's the greatest
 scientific achievement of the 20th

Speaker 0 :century and engineering in some sense


Speaker 1 :engineering I mean really you know
 voyagers and Voyager is doing this on less energy than you have in yourtoaster something like 11 watts so ok
 but because of this gravitational assist both voyagers were destined as I say tothey were just they were personal they
 were supposed to function for a dozen years and now it's 42 years since launchand we're still talking to them so
 that's amazing but prior to launch almost a year hmmeight nine months prior to launch it was
 decided that since Frank Drake and Carl Sagan and Linda sauceman Sagan hadcreated something called the Pioneer 10
 plaque for the Pioneer spacecraft that preceded Voyager which was kind of likea license plate for the planet Earth you
 know a man and a woman hands up you know very very basic but very effective andit captured the imagination of people
 all over the world and so NASA turn to Frank and to Carl and said we'dlike you to do a message for Voyager
 because if it's going to be circumnavigating the Milky Way galaxyfor one to five billion years you know
 it's like 20 trips around the galaxy and there's a very small chance that aspacefaring civilization would be able
 to flag one of them down and so on board you see this exquisite golden disc withscientific hieroglyphics explaining our
 address and various basic scientific concepts that we believe that would becommon to any spacefaring civilization
 and then beneath this exquisite golden disc is the Voyager record the goldenrecord and it contains something like
 118 photographs images of life on Earth as well as 27 pieces of music from allaround the world many people describe it
 as the invention of world music world music was not a concept that existedbefore the Voyager record and we were
 determined to take our music not just from the dominant technical cultures butfrom all of the rich cultural heritage
 of the earth and there's a sound essay which is kind of using using amicrophone as a camera to tell the story
 of the earth beginning with its geological sounds and moving intobiology and then into technology and
 likes I think what you were getting at is that at the end of this sound essay Ihad asked Carl if it were in the making
 of the record it was my honor to be the creative director of theproject if it was possible to if I had
 meditated for an hour while I was hooked up so that you know every single signalit was coming from my brain my body was
 recorded and then converted into into sound for the record was it possiblethat these putative extraterrestrials of
 the distant future of perhaps the billion years from now would be able toreconstitute this message and to
 understand it and he just big smile and so I did this and what were you thinking

Speaker 0 :about in the meditation like what I mean
 it's such an interesting idea of recording as you think about things what

Speaker 1 :were you thinking about so I was
 blindfolded and couldn't hear anything and I had made an a mental itinerary ofexactly where I wanted to go I was truly
 humbled by the idea that these thoughts could conceivably touch the distantfuture
 that's incredible so it's 1977 there are some 60,000 nuclear weapons on theplanet the Soviet Union and the United
 States are engaged in a you know to the death competition and so I began bytrying to tell the history of the planet
 in you know to my limited ability what I understood about the story of the earlyexistence of the war of the planet about
 the origin of life about the evolution of life about our the history of humansabout our current at that time
 predicament about the fact that one in five of us was starving uh or unable toget potable water
 and so I sort of gave a kind of you know it's general a picture as I possiblycould of our predicament
 and I also I was Perry newly within days of the moment when Carl and I fell inlove with each other maybe we fell in
 love with each other long before because we'd known each other for years but itwas the first time we had expressed our
 feelings for each other acknowledged did

Speaker 0 :the existence of this yes because we're


Speaker 1 :both involved with other people and it
 was a completely outside his morality in mine to even broach the subject but itwas only days after that it happened and
 for me it was a Eureka moment it was in the context of finding that piece ofChinese music that was worthy to
 represent one of the oldest musical traditions on earth when those of us whoworked on the Voyager record were
 completely ignorant about Chinese music and so that had been a constantchallenge for me talking to professor's
 of Chinese music ethnomusicologist everywhere and all through the projectdesperately trying to find this one
 piece found the piece lived on the Upper West Side found the piece a professor atColumbia University gave it to me and
 he's of all the people I talked to everyone didn't said that's hopeless youcan't do that that there can't be one
 piece of Chinese music but he was completely no problem I've got it and sohe he told me the story of the piece
 which only made it an even greater candidate for the record which and Ilistened to it called Carl Sagan who was
 in Tucson Arizona addressing the American Society of newspaper editorsand and I left him a message
 Hotel message center and he called me back an hour later and heard thisbeautiful voice say I came back to my
 hotel room and I find this message that any card and I asked myself why didn'tyou leave me this message ten years ago
 my heart was beating out of my chest I it was for me a kind of Eureka momentokay a scientific breakthrough yeah a
 truth a great truth it suddenly been revealed and of course I was awkward anddidn't really know what to say and so I
 blurted something out like oh I've been meaning to talk to you about that Karlwhich wasn't really true I never would
 have talked to him about it we had been

Speaker 0 :alone countless times we humans are so
 awkward

Speaker 1 :in his beautiful moments and I just said
 for keeps and he thought for a very brief like a second and said you meanget married and I said yeah and he said
 yeah and we put down the phone and Iliterally was jumping around my
 apartment like a lunatic because it was so obvious you know it was somethinglike of course and then the phone rang
 again and I thought damn no he's gonna say I don't know but he was like I justwant to make sure that that really
 happened and I said yeah he said we're getting married and I said yeah we'regetting married now this was June 1st
 1977 the record had not been affixed to the spacecraft yet and there had been alot of controversy about what we were
 doing I should say that there you know among the hundred and eighteen pictureswas an image of a man and
 frontally completely naked naked and there was I believe a congressman on thefloor that said NASA to send smut to the
 stars you know and so NASA really they got very upset they said you can't senda picture and we had done it so that it
 was so brilliant it was like this lovely couple completely naked and then thenext image was kind of overlay schematic
 to show the fetus inside this woman that was developing and then that went offinto you know additional imagery of
 human reproduction and it really hit me that how much we hate ourselves that wecouldn't bear to be seen as we are


Speaker 0 :so in some sense that congressman also
 represents our society perhaps his opposition should have been included as

Speaker 1 :well yes well that's was one of the most
 vigorous debates during the making of the record with a you know the five orsix people that we collaborated with was
 do we show do we only put our best foot forward or do we show Hiroshima outwitsthe Congo what we have done what do you


Speaker 0 :think represents humanity if you kind of
 if you think about it did our darker moments are they essential for Humanityall the wars we've been through all the
 tortures and the suffering and the cruelty is that essential for happinessfor beauty for creation generally he's


Speaker 1 :really not essential for a happiness or
 beauty as for sure I mean it's part of who we are if we're gonna be real aboutit
 which is you know I I think we tell on ourselves even if we don't want to bereal we you know I think that if you're
 a spacefaring civilization and you've gotten it together sufficiently you canmove from world to world then I think
 they probably took one look at this derelict spacecraft and they knew thatthese were people in their techno
 logical adolescence yeah and they were just setting forth and they must havehad these issues but you know because
 and so really you know that's the great thing about lying is that a lie only hasa shelf life like if you make a great
 work of art that's a forgery people can be fooled immediately but 10 or 15 years20 years later they start to look at it
 yeah you know that begin to realize of the lens our lens of our present iscoloring everything that we see so you
 know I think it didn't matter that we didn't show our atrocities they would

Speaker 0 :fill in the blanks they would fill in


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the blanks so let me sort of ask you've
 mentioned how likely it is that you and Carla did two souls like yours wouldmeet in this vast world
 what are you views on how and why incredibly unlikely things like thesenevertheless do happen it's purely to me


Speaker 1 :a chance it's totally random
 it's adjust I mean but and the fact is is there some people or and it'shappening every day right now some
 people are the random casualties of chance and that and I don't just meanthe people who are being you know
 destroyed in childhood in more time I'm also or people who starve to deathbecause of famine but also the people
 who um you know who who are not living to the fullest all of these things Ithink there's a rent my parents met on
 the subway in rush hour and so I'm only here were you because of the most randompossible situation and so I've had this
 a sense of this even before I knew car I always felt this way that I only existedbecause of the generosity of the rush


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :hour I know just all of the things all
 of the skeins of causality

Speaker 0 :yeah it's interesting because you know
 that our shower is the source of stress for a lot of people but clearly in itsmoments it can also be a source of
 something beautiful it's right of strangers meeting and so on soeverything everything is has the
 possibility of doing some fancy right so

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :let me ask sort of a quick tangent on
 the Voyager so that this this beautiful romantic notion that Voyager 1 is sortof our farthest human reach into space
 if you think of what I don't know if you've seen but what Elon Musk did withthe putting the roadster letting it fly
 out into space there's a sort of humor to it I think that's also kind ofinteresting but maybe you can comment on
 that but in general if now that we are developing what we were venturing outinto space again in a more serious way
 what kind of stuff that represent since Voyager was launched should we send outas a follow-up is there things that you
 think that's developed the next in in the 40 years after that we should updatethe the spacefaring aliens of course now


Speaker 1 :we could send the worldwide we could
 send everything that's on the world wide web we could send I mean you know thatwas a time when we're talking about
 phonograph records and transistor radios and you know so we tried to be to takeadvantage of the existing technology to
 the fullest extent you know the computer that was hooked up to me from my brainwaves in my heart sounds while I was
 meditating was the size of a gigantic room and I'm sure it's not that didn'thave the power of a phone as that phone
 has now so you know we could just I think we could let it all hang out youjust stood send you know ever we I mean
 that's the wonder like I would send you know Wikipedia or something and notbeing a gatekeeper but


Speaker 0 :this thing because we are you were also
 it's interesting because it one of the problems of the Internet of having somuch information is it's actually the
 curation the human curation is still the powerful beautiful thing yeah so whatyou did with the record is actually is
 exactly the right process is kind of boiling down a massive amount ofpossibilities of what you could send
 into something that represents you know the better angels of our nature orrepresents our humanity so if you think
 about you know what would you send from the Internet as opposed to sending allof Wikipedia for example all human
 knowledge is there something just new that we've developed you think orfundamentally we're still the same kind
 of human species I think fundamentally

Speaker 1 :were the same but we have a kind of way
 we are we have advanced a to an astonishing degree in our capacity fordata retrieval and for transmission and
 so you know I would send YouTube I would send no it really like think of all thatyou know I I still feel so lucky that
 there's any great musical artists of the last hundred years who I revere I canjust find them and watch them and listen
 to them and you know that's fantastic I also love how democratic it is that weeach become curators that we each decide
 those things now I may not agree with you know those the choices that everyonemakes but of course not because that's
 not the point the point is is that we are you know we've discovered largelythrough the internet that we are an
 intercommunicating organism and that can

Speaker 0 :only be good so you could also send now
 cosmos yes I love it

Speaker 1 :I will be proud I mean you're spoken


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :about a very specific voice that cosmos
 I had in that it reveals the magical science I think you said shamanicjourney of it and not the details of the
 latest breakthrough so on he's just revealing the magic can youtry to describe what this voice of
 cosmos is with the with the follow-up and the new cosmos that you're working

Speaker 1 :on now yes well a dream of cosmos is
 really like Einsteins quote you know it's the idea of the awesome power ofscience to be in absolutely everyone's
 hands you know it belongs to all of us it's not the preserve of a priesthoodit's just just the community of science
 is becoming more diverse and being less exclusive than it was guilty of in thenot so recent past the discoveries of
 science our understanding of the cosmos that we live in has really grown byleaps and bounds and probably we've
 learned more in the last hundred years about it you know the the tempo ofdiscovery has picked up so rapidly and
 so the idea of cosmos from the 1970s when Carl and I and Steven Soter anotherastronomer first imagined it was that
 interweaving not only of these scientific concepts and revelations andusing you know cinematic VFX to take the
 viewer on this transporting uplifting journey but also the stories of thesearchers because the more I have
 learned about you know the process of science through my life with Carl andsince the more I am really persuaded
 that it's that adherence to the facts and to that adherence to that littleproximation that little bit of reality
 that we've been able to get our hands around is something that we desperatelyneed and it doesn't matter if you are a
 scientist in fact the people it matters even more if you're not and since youknow the level of science teaching has
 been fairly or unfairly maligned and the idea that once there was such a thing asa television network which of course has
 now evolved into many other things the idea that you could in the mostdemocratic way make accessible to
 absolutely everyone and most especially people who don't even realize that theyhave an interest in a subject or who
 feel so intimidated by the jargon of science and it's kind of exclusivehistory the idea that we could do this
 and you know in season 2 of cosmos spacetime Odyssey we were in a hundredand eighty-one countries in the space of
 two weeks it was the largest rollout in television history which is reallyamazing for it
 there is no science-based program by the

Speaker 0 :way just to clarify this series was
 rolled out so it was shown in in that many countries you said we were in well

Speaker 1 :our show the show the show which is


Speaker 0 :incredible I mean the the the hundreds
 of million whatever that number is that people that watched it it's just it's

Speaker 1 :crazy it's so crazy Pat for instance uh
 my son had a cerebral hemorrhage here ago and the doctor who saved his life ina very dangerous situation when he
 realized that you know that Sam and I were who we werehe said that's why I'm here you know he
 said if you come of age in a poor country like Colombia and Carl Sagancalls you to science when you're a child
 then then you know you go to medicine becausethe only Avenue open to you but that's
 why I'm here and I have heard that story and I hearthat story I think every week how does


Speaker 0 :that make you feel I mean I the the
 number of scientists I mean a lot of it is quiet right but the number ofscientists cosmos has created is just
 countless I mean it probably touched a lives I don't know probably it could bea crazy number of the 90% of scientists
 or something I'd have been I was going

Speaker 1 :to do that census because I because
 that's the month the greatest gratification because that's the dreamof science and that's the whole idea is
 that if it belongs to all of us and not just a tiny few then we have some chanceof determining how it's used and if it's
 only in the hands of people whose only whose only interests are the balancesheet or hegemony over other nations or
 things like that then it'll probably end up being a gun aimed in our heads but ifit's distributed in the widest possible
 way a capability that we now have because of our technology then thischance is that that it'll be used with
 wisdom that's that's the dream of it so that's that's why we did the firstcosmos we wanted to take not just as I
 say the scientific information but also tell the stories of these searchersbecause for us and for me it carrying on
 this a series in the second and third seasons the the primary interest wasthat we wouldn't tell a story unless it
 was a kind of a three-fer you know it was not just a way to understand a newsign a scientific idea but it was also a
 way to understand what if it matters what's true wow the world can change forus and how we can be protected
 and if it doesn't matter what's true then we're in grave danger because wehave the capability to not only destroy
 ourselves and our civilization but to take so many species with us and I'd

Speaker 0 :like to talk to you about that
 particular the sort of the dangers of ourselves in a little bit but sort of tolinger on cosmos maybe for the first the
 1980 in the 2014 follow-up what a what's a or one of the or several memorablemoments from the creation of either of
 those seasons well you know the critical

Speaker 1 :thing really was the fact that Seth
 MacFarlane became our champion because I had been with three colleagues I hadbeen slapping around from network to
 network with a treatment for cosmos and every network said they wanted to do itbut they wouldn't give me creative
 control and they wouldn't give me enough money to make it cinematic and to makeit feel like you're really going on an
 adventure and so I think both of those things

Speaker 0 :sorry in turn draw both these things are
 given what cosmos represents the the legacy of it and the legacy of CarlSagan is essential control especially in
 the modern world I it's it's was wonderful the Assad control he did not

Speaker 1 :really push it no I'm sure I know they
 would look at me like I was nuts you know and they probably must haveentertained the idea that maybe I didn't
 really want to do it you know because that was afraid or something but I keptsaying no and it wasn't until I met Seth
 MacFarlane and he took me to Fox and you Peter rice and said you know I'll payfor half the pilot if I have to you know
 and Peter rice was like put your money

Speaker 0 :away and Seth said that yeah and and and


Speaker 1 :and in every time since in the in the
 10-year sense at every turn when we needed Seth to intervene on our behalfhe stood up and he did it and so that
 was like in a way that is the you know the watershed for me of the everythingthat followed since and then I was so
 lucky because I know Steve and I Steve Souter and I written the original cosmoswith Carl and were co-opted and
 collaborated on the treatment for a season 2 and then Brannon Braga cameinto our project at the perfect moment
 and has proven to be like just the really I have been so lucky my wholelife I've collaborated I've been lucky
 with the people my collaborators have been extraordinary and so that was acritical thing but also to have you know
 for instance astonishing VFX supervisor who comes from the movies who heads theglobal Association of VFX people Jeff
 oaken and and then and you know I can rattle off ten more names I'd be happyto do that and it was that collaboration


Speaker 0 :so the people were essential to the


Speaker 1 :creation of absolutely I mean when it
 came down I have to say that when it came down to the vision of what theseries would be that with me sitting in
 my home looking out the window and I'm you know really imagining like what Iwanted to do can you pause on that for a


Speaker 0 :second like what's that process because
 it you know cosmos is also it's grounded in science of course but it's alsoincredibly imaginative and the words
 used are carefully crafted thank you so what if you couldn't talk about theprocess of that the big picture
 imaginative thinking and so the rigorous crafting of words that like basicallyturns into something like poetry thank


Speaker 1 :you so much for me these are rare
 occasions for human self-esteem the scientists that we bring to life incosmos are people in my view
 who have everything we need to see us through this current crisis it's therevery often they come they're poor
 they're a female they're outsiders who are not expected to have gifts that areso pretentious but they persevere and so
 you have someone like Michael Faraday who is comes from a family dysfunctionalfamily of like 14 people and you know if
 never goes to university never learns the math but you know is the you knowthere's Einstein years later looking up
 at that picture of Faraday to inspire him there so it's you know if we hadpeople we've had kind of humility and
 unselfishness who didn't want to patent everything me as you know MichaelFaraday created the wealth of the 20th
 century with his various inventions and yet he never took out a single patent ata time when people were patenting
 everything because that was not what he was about and to me that's a kind ofalmost a saintliness vet says that you
 know that here's a man who finds in his life this tremendous gratification fromsearching and it's just so impressive to
 me and there are so many other people in cosmos especially the new season ofcosmos which is called possible worlds


Speaker 0 :possible beautiful title with possible


Speaker 1 :worlds well I stole it from an author
 and a scientist with the 1940s but it it for me encapsulate not just you know theexoplanets that we'd begun to discover
 not just you know the the worlds that we might visit but also the world that thiscould be a hopeful vision of the future
 you asked me what is common to all three seasons ofwhat is that voice it's the voice of
 hope it's a voice that says there is the future which we bring to life and Ithink fairly dazzling fashion that we
 can still have you know and in sitting down to imagine what this season wouldbe the new season I'd be sitting where I
 live in Ithaca beautiful trees everywhere waterfalls yeah you'resitting there thinking well you can't
 how do you how do you awaken people I mean you can't yell at them and saywe're all gonna die no it's not it
 doesn't help it doesn't help but I think if you give them a vision of the futurethat's not pie in the sky but something
 the ways in which science can be redemptive can actually remediate ourfuture we have those capabilities right
 now as well as the capabilities to do things in the cosmos that we could bedoing right now but we're not doing them
 not because we don't know how to how you know with the engineering or thematerial sciences or the physics we know
 all we need to know but we're a little bit paralyzed in some sense and you knowwe're like I always think we're like the
 toddler you know like we we left our mothers legs you know and scurried outto the moon yeah and we had a moment of
 wow we can do this and then we realized and somehow we had a failure of nerveand we went scurrying back to our mother
 and you know did things that really weren't gonna get us out there like aSpace Shuttle things like that because
 it was a kind of failure of nerve so cosmos is about overcoming those fears

Speaker 0 :we're now as a civilization ready to be
 a teenager venturing out into college we're returning back exactly you're

Speaker 1 :exactly and that and that's one of my
 theories about our current situation is that this is ouradolescence and I was a total mess I
 wasn't I was reckless irresponsible totally I didn't I was inconsiderateyeah I the reality of other people's
 feelings and the future didn't exist for me so why should a technologicallyadolescent civilization be any different
 but you know the vast majority of people I know made it through that period andwent on to be more wise and that's what
 my hope is for our civilization on a

Speaker 0 :sort of darker and more difficult
 subject in terms of so you talked about the cosmos being an inspiration forscience and for us growing out of our
 messy adolescence but nevertheless there is threats in this world so do you worryabout existential threats like emission
 nuclear weapons you worry about nuclear war yes and if you could also maybecomment I don't know how much you've
 thought about it but I was there's folks like Elon Musk or worried about theexistential threats of artificial
 intelligence sort of our robotic computer creations sort of yeahresulting in us humans losing control so
 can you speak to the things that were

Speaker 1 :you in terms of existential concern you
 know like not to think and not to look at for instance are rapidly burgeoningcapability in artificial intelligence
 not and to see how sick so much of the planet is not to be concerned and sick

Speaker 0 :isn't evil potentially well hum-hum is


Speaker 1 :cruelty and brutality is happening at
 this very moment and I would put climate change higher up on that list because Ibelieve that there are on
 Sene discoveries that we are making right now for instance all that methanethat's coming out of the ocean floor
 that was sequestered because of the permafrost which is now melting you knowI think there are other effects besides
 our greed and short-term thinking you know that we are triggering now with allthe greenhouse gases were putting into
 the atmosphere and that worries me day at night I think about it every singleevery moment really because I really
 think that's how we have to be we have to begin to really focus on how gravethe challenges to our civilization and
 to the other species that are it's the mass it this is a mass extinction eventthat we're living through and we're
 seeing it we're seeing news of it every

Speaker 0 :day so what do you think about another
 touchy subject but what do you think about the politicization of science ontopics like global warming embryonic
 stem cell research and other topics like it what's your sense why what do you

Speaker 1 :mean by the politicization of meaning


Speaker 0 :that if you say I think what you just
 said which is global warming as a serious concerns human caused arrangesome detrimental effects currently
 there's a large percent of the population of the United States thatwould as opposed to listening to that
 statement would immediately think oh that's just a liberal talking pointthat's not I mean it's not so true


Speaker 1 :anymore
 I don't think our problem is a population events skeptical aboutclimate change because I think that the
 extreme weather fire events that we are experiencing with such frequency it'sreally gotten to people I think there I
 think that there are people in leadership positionwho choose to ignore it and to pretend
 it's not there but ultimately I think they will be rejected the question iswill it be fast enough but you know this
 I don't I think actually that most people have really finally taken thereality of global climate change to
 heart and they look at their children and grandchildrenand they don't feel good because they
 come from a world which was in many ways in terms of climate fairly familiar andbenign and they know that we're headed
 in another direction and it's not just that it's what we do to the oceans therivers the air you know I mean you asked
 me like what is what is the message of cosmos is it's that is that we have tothink in longer terms you know I think
 of the Soviet Union United States in the Cold War and they're ready to kill eachother over these two different views of
 the distribution of resources but neither of them has a form of humansocial organization that thinks in terms
 of a hundred years let alone a thousand years which are the timescales thatscience speaks in and that's part of the
 problem is that we have to get a grip on reality and where we're headed and it'sI I'm not fatalistic at all but I do
 feel like it you and in setting out to to do this series each season we weretalking about climate change in the
 original cosmos in Episode four and warning about inadvertent climatemodification in 1980
 you know and of course Carl did his PhD thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venusand he was painfully cognizant of it
 when a runaway greenhouse effect would do to our planet and not only that butthe climb
 history of the planet which we go into in great detail in the series so yeah Imean how are we gonna get a grip on this
 if not through some kind of understanding of science can I just sayone more thing about science is that its
 powers of prophecy are astonishing you launch a spacecraft in 1977 and you knowwhere each and every planet in the solar
 system is going to be in every moon and you rendezvous with that flawlessly andyou exceed the design specifications of
 the greatest dreams that the engineers and then you go on to explore the MilkyWay galaxy and you do it I mean you know
 the climate scientists some of the people that we use stories we tell incosmos they their predictions were and
 they were working with very early computer modeling capabilities they haveproven to be so robust nuclear winter
 all of these things this is a prophetic power and yet how crazy that you knowit's like it's like the Romans with
 their lead cooking pots and their lead pipes or the Aztecs ripping out theirown people's hearts this is us we know
 better and yet we are acting as if it's business as usual yeah the beautiful

Speaker 0 :complexity of human nature there's a
 speaking of which let me ask a tough question I guess because there's so manypossible answers but what aspect of life
 here on earth do you find most fascinating from the origin of life theevolutionary process itself the origin
 of the human mind so intelligence the some of the technological developmentsgoing on now or us venturing out into
 space or space exploration what just

Speaker 1 :inspires you inspire me but I just say
 that to me at the archana as I've gotten older tome the origin of life has become less
 interesting interesting well because I feel well not because it's more I thinkI understand I have a better grasp of
 how it might have happened do you think

Speaker 0 :it was a huge leap so I may think it was


Speaker 1 :that we are a byproduct of geophysics
 and I think it's not I my suspicion of course which is taking it with a grainof salt but my suspicion is that it
 happens more often and more places than we like to think because you know afterall the history of our thinking about
 ourselves there's been a constant series of demotions in which we've had yourealize no no so to me that's not at the


Speaker 0 :center of the origin of consciousness is


Speaker 1 :to me also not so amazing if you think
 of it as you know going back to these one celled organisms of a billion yearsago who had had to know well if I go
 higher up I'll get too much Sun and if I go lowerdown not I'll be protected from you know
 UV rays things like that they have to know that or you I eat me I don't I meaneven that I can see if you know that
 then knowing what we know now it's just it's not so hard to fathom it seems likeyou know there's I never believed there
 was a duality between our minds and our bodies and I think that even

Speaker 0 :consciousness all those seem to me


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :except my Oh physics chemistry yes


Speaker 1 :geochemistry geophysics absolutely of
 you know it makes perfect sense to me and it doesn't make it any less wondrousit it doesn't wrap it at all of the
 wonder of it and so yeah I think that's amazing I think you know we tell thestory of someone you have never heard of
 I guarantee and I think you're very knowledgeable of a subject who was moreresponsible for our ability to venture
 out to other worlds when anyone else and who was completely forgotten and sothose are the kinds of stories I like


Speaker 0 :best for cosmos you tell me who buy my


Speaker 1 :book you know but I'm just saying like
 this person would be forgotten but you know I you just the way that we docosmos is that like I ask a question to
 myself we really want to get to the bottom to the answer and keep goingdeeper deeper until we find what the
 story is a story that I know because I'm not a scientist if it moves me if it ifit moves me then I want to tell it and
 other people be moved

Speaker 0 :do you ponder mortality yes human
 mortality and maybe even your own mortality oh all the time

Speaker 1 :I just turned 70 so yeah I think about
 it a lot I mean it's you know how could you not think about it but uh what do

Speaker 0 :you make of this short life of ours a I
 mean let me ask uh sort of another way

Speaker 1 :you've lost Carl and speaking of


Speaker 0 :mortality if you could be if you could
 choose immortality you know it's possible that science allows us to livemuch much longer is that something you
 would choose for yourself for Carl Carl

Speaker 1 :definitely I would you know in a
 nanosecond I would take that deal but not for me I mean if car were alive yesI would want to live forever but no


Speaker 0 :would it be fun forever that's I don't


Speaker 1 :know it's just that the universe is so
 full of so many wonderful things just discover that it feels like it wouldn'tbe fine but no I don't want to live
 forever I I have had a magical life I just might you know Mikecraziest dreams have come true and I
 feel you know I forgive me but this crazy quirk of fateit put my most joyful deepest feelings
 feelings that decades later of 42 years later I know how real how true thosefeelings were everything that happened
 after that was an affirmation of how true those feelings were and so I don'tfeel that way I feel like I have gotten
 so much more than my share um not just my extraordinary life with Carl myfamily my parents my children my friends
 the places that I've been able to explore the but the books I've read themusic ever heard so I feel like you know
 if it'd be much better if instead of working on the immortality of the luckyfew of the most privileged people in the
 society I would really like to see a concerted effort for us to get us ouract together you know that to me is
 topic a more pressing you know this possible world is thechallenge and we're at a kind of moment
 where if we can we can make that choice so immortality doesn't really interestme I I really I love nature and I have
 to say that I I because I'm a product of nature I recognize that it's it's greatgifts and it's great cruelty well I


Speaker 0 :don't think there's a better way to end
 it anything thank you so much for talking to us at all it's wonderful

Speaker 1 :really appreciate it I really enjoyed it
 I thought your questions but great thank you
