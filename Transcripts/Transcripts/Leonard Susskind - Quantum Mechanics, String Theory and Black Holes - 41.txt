Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 Leonard Susskind he's a professor of theoretical physics at StanfordUniversity and founding director of
 Stanford Institute of theoretical physics he's widely regarded as one ofthe fathers of string theory and in
 general is one of the greatest physicists of our time both as aresearcher and an educator this is the
 artificial intelligence podcast perhaps you noticed that the people have beenspeaking with are not just computer
 scientists but philosophers mathematicians writers psychologistsphysicists and soon other disciplines to
 me AI is much bigger than deep learning bigger than computing it is ourcivilizations journey into understanding
 the human mind and creating echoes of it in the machine if you enjoy the podcastsubscribe on YouTube give it five stars

 ma a.m. and now here's my conversation with leonard susskindyou work two more friends with richard
 fineman house he influenced you changed you as a physicist and thinker what I

Speaker 0 :saw I think what I saw was somebody who
 could do physics in this deeply intuitive way his style was almost aclosed his eyes and visualize the
 phenomena that he was thinking about and through visualizationI'll flank the mathematical highly
 mathematical and very very sophisticated technical arguments that people woulduse I think that was also natural to me
 but I saw somebody who was actually successful at itwho could do physics in a way that that
 I regarded as simpler more direct more intuitive and while I don't think hechanged my way of thinking I do think he
 validated it he made me look at it and say yeah that's something you can do andget away with practically even get away
 with it

Speaker 1 :so do you find yourself whether you're
 thinking about quantum mechanics or black holes or string theory usingintuition as a first step or step
 throughout using visualization yeah very

Speaker 0 :much so very much so I tend not to think
 about the equations I tend not to think about the symbols I tend to try tovisualize the phenomena themselves and
 then when I get an insight that I think is valid I might try to convert it tomathematics but I'm not a math and then
 a natural mathematician or I'm good enough at it I'm good enough at it butI'm not a great mathematician so for me
 the way of thinking about physics is first intuitive first visualizationscribble a few equations maybe but then
 try to convert it to mathematics experiences that other people are betterat converting into mathematics and I am


Speaker 1 :and yet you've worked very
 counterintuitive ideas so how that's

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :true that's naive is something Connor


Speaker 0 :into every their rewiring your brain in
 new ways yeah quantum mechanics is not intuitive verylittle of modern physics is intuitive
 intuitive or what does intuitive mean it means the ability to think about it withbasic classical physics the physics that
 that we evolved with throwing stones splashing water or whatever it happensto be quantum physics general relativity
 quantum field theory are deeply unintuitive in that way but you knowafter time and getting familiar with
 these things you develop new intuitions I always said you rewire and it's to thepoint where me and many of my friends
 find many my friends can think more easilyquantum-mechanically than we can
 classically we've gotten so used to it I

Speaker 1 :mean yes our neural wiring in our brain
 is such that we understand rocks and stones and water and so I'm sort of

Speaker 0 :evolved evolved for you do you think


Speaker 1 :it's possible to create a wiring of
 neuron like state devices that more naturally understand quantum mechanicsunderstand wave function understand
 these weird things well I'm not sure I

Speaker 0 :think many of us have evolved the
 ability to think quantum mechanically to some extent but that doesn't mean youcan think like an electron
 that doesn't mean an another example forget for a minute quantum mechanicsjust visualizing four dimensional space
 or five dimensional space or six dimensional space I think we'refundamentally wired to visualize three
 dimensions I can't even visualize two dimensions orone dimension without thinking about it
 as embedded in three dimension in space if I want to visualize a line I think ofthe line as being aligned in three
 dimensions right well I think of the line as being aligned on a piece ofpaper with a piece of paper being in
 three dimensions I never seem to be able to in some abstract and pure wayvisualize in my head the one dimension
 the two dimension the four dimensions the five dimensions and I don't thinkthat's ever gonna happen the reason is I
 think our neural wiring is just set up for that on the other hand we do learnways to think about five six seven
 dimensions and we learn ways we learn mathematical ways and we learn ways tovisualize them but they're different and
 so yeah I think I think we do rewire ourselves whether we can ever completelyrewire ourselves to be completely
 comfortable with these concepts I doubt

Speaker 1 :so that it's completely natural there


Speaker 0 :was a tour it's completely natural so


Speaker 1 :I'm sure there's some what you could
 argue creatures that live in it

Speaker 0 :two-dimensional space yeah and there are


Speaker 1 :and um well it's romanticizing the
 notion of course we're all living as far as we know in three-dimensional spacebut how do you how do those creatures
 imagine 3d space well probably the way

Speaker 0 :we imagined 4d by using some mathematics
 and some equations and some some tricks

Speaker 1 :okay so jumping back to a fireman just
 for a second he had a little bit of an

Speaker 0 :ego yes


Speaker 1 :what do you think ego is powerful or


Speaker 0 :dangerous in science I think both both
 both I think you have to have both arrogance and humility you have to havethe arrogance to say I can do this
 nature is difficult nature is very very hard I'm smart enough I can do it I canwin the battle with nature on the other
 hand I think you also have to have the humility to know that you're very likelyto be wrong on any given occasion
 everything you're thinking could suddenly change young people can comealong and say things you won't
 understand and you'll be lost and flabbergasted so I think it's acombination of both you better recognize
 that you're very limited and you better be able to say to yourself I'm not solimited that I can't win this battle
 with nature it takes a special kind of person who canmanage both of those I would say and I


Speaker 1 :would say there's echoes of that in your
 own work a little bit of ego a little bit of outside of the box humble

Speaker 0 :thinking I hope so


Speaker 1 :so it was their time where you complete
 you felt you looked at yourself and asked am i completely wrong about this

Speaker 0 :oh yeah but the whole thing about


Speaker 1 :specific things the whole thing that way


Speaker 0 :which cold thing me and me and my
 ability to do this thing

Speaker 1 :oh those kinds of doubts those first of
 all did you have those kinds of doubts

Speaker 0 :no I had different kind of doubts I came
 from a very working-class background and I was uncomfortable in academia for Ohfor a long time but they weren't doubts
 about my ability of my they were just the discomfort and being in anenvironment that my family hadn't
 participated in I know nothing about as a young person I didn't learn that therewas such a thing called physics until I
 was almost 20 years old so I did have certain kind of doubts but not about myability I don't think I was too worried
 about whether I would succeed or not I never I never felt this insecurity am Iever gonna get a job that veteran never
 occurred to me that I wouldn't maybe you

Speaker 1 :could speak a little bit to this sense
 of what is academia for because I do feel a bit uncomfortable in it mm-hm

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :there's something I can't put quite into
 words what you have that's not doesn't if we call it musicyou play a different kind of music than
 a lot of academia what how have you joined this Orchestra how do you thinkabout it


Speaker 0 :I don't know that I thought about it as
 much as I just felt it yeah you know thinking is one thing feeling is anotherthing I felt like an outsider until a
 certain age when I suddenly found myself the ultimate insider in academic physicsand that was a sharp transition in the
 world I wasn't the young man I was probably 50 years old you were never

Speaker 1 :quite it was a phase transition you were
 never quite free milk in the middle yeah

Speaker 0 :that's right I wasn't I always felt a
 little bit of an outsider the beginning a lot and outside Earthmy way of thinking was different
 my approach to mathematics was different but also this my social background thatI came from was different now these days
 half the young people I meet their parents were professors my that was notmy case so yeah but then all of a sudden
 at some point I found myself at they're very much the center of maybe not theonly one at the center but certainly one
 of the people in the center of a certain kind of physics and all that put away I

Speaker 1 :mean I went away in a flash so maybe


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :maybe a little bit with Fineman but in
 general how do you develop ideas do you work their ideas alone do you brainstorm

Speaker 0 :with others oh both both very definitely
 both the earth the younger time I spent more time with myself now because I'm atStanford because I'm because I have a
 lot of ex students and I you know people who who are interested in the same thingI am I spend a good deal of time almost
 on a daily basis interacting brainstorming as you said it's a it's avery important part I spend less time
 probably completely self focused and the paper and just sitting there staringat it


Speaker 1 :what are your hopes for quantum
 computers so machines that are based on that have some elements of leveragequantum mechanical ideas yeah it's not


Speaker 0 :just leveraging quantum mechanical ideas
 you can simulate quantum systems on a classical computer simulate them meanssolve the Schrodinger equation for them
 or solve the equations of quantum mechanics on a computer on a classicalcomputer but the classical computer is
 not doing is not a quantum mechanical system itself of course it is thateverything is made of quantum mechanics
 but it's not some functioning it's not a functioning as a quantum systemit's just solving equations the quantum
 computer is truly a quantum system which is actually doing the things that you'reprogramming it to do you want to program
 a quantum field theory if you do it in classical physics that program is notactually functioning in the computer as
 a quantum field theory it's just solving some equations physically it's not doingthe things that that the quantum system
 would do the quantum computer is really a quantum mechanical system which isactually carrying out the quantum
 operations you can measure it at the end it intrinsically satisfies theuncertainty principle it is limited in
 the same way that quantum systems are limited by uncertainty and so forth andit really is a quantum system that means
 that what you what you're doing when you program something for quantum system isthey're actually building a real version
 of the system the limits of a classical computer classical computers areenormous ly limited when it comes to the
 quantum systems enormously limited because you probably heard this beforebut in order to store the amount of
 information that's in a quantum state of 400 spins that's not very many 400 I canput in my path
 with 400 pennies in my pocket so we'll be able to simulate the quantum state of400 elementary quantum systems qubits we
 call him to do that would take more information than can possibly be storedin the entire universe if it were packed
 so tightly that you couldn't pack anymore in right 400 cubits on the otherhand if your quantum computer is
 composed of four hundred qubits it can do everything four hundred qubits can do

Speaker 1 :what kind of space if you just
 intuitively think about the space of algorithms that that unlocks for us sothere's a whole complexity theory around
 classical computers measuring the running time of things and PE so on whatkind of algorithm is just intuitively do
 you think it's you know mocks for us

Speaker 0 :okay so we know that there are a handful
 of algorithms that can seriously be quantum of classical computers and whichcan have exponentially more power and
 this is a mathematical statement nobody's exhibited this in thelaboratory it's a mathematical statement
 we know that's true but it also seems more and more that the number of suchthings is very limited only very very
 special problems exhibit that much advantage for a quantum computer othersof standard problems to my mind as far
 as I can tell the great power of quantum computers will actually be to simulatequantum systems if you're interested in
 a certain quantum system and it's too hard to simulate classically you simplybuild a version of the same system you
 build a version of it you build a model of it that's actually functioning as thesystem you run it and then you do the
 same thing you would do the quantum system you make measurements on itquantum measurements on it the
 advantages you can run it much slower you could say why bother why not justuse the real system and why not just do
 experiments on the real system well real systems are kind of limited you can'tchange them you can't
 like them you can't slow them down so that you can poke into them you can'tmodify them an arbitrary kinds of ways
 to see what would happen if I if I change the system a little bit so Ithink that quantum computers will be
 extremely valuable in in understanding quantum systems at the

Speaker 1 :lowest of the fundamental laws they're


Speaker 0 :actually satisfying the same laws as the
 systems that they're simulating that's right okay so in the one hand you havethings like factoring in factoring is
 the great thing of quantum computers factoring large numbers that doesn'tseem that much to do with quantum
 mechanics right it seems to be almost a fluke that a quantum computer can solvethe factoring problem in a short time so
 though and those problems seem to be extremely special rare and it's notclear to me that there's gonna be a lot
 of them on the other hand there are a lot of quantum systems chemistry there'ssolid-state physics there's material
 science there's quantum gravity there's all kinds of quantum of quantum fieldtheory and some of these are actually
 turning out to be Applied Sciences as well as very fundamental Sciences so weprobably will run out of the ability to
 solve equations for these things you know solve equations by the standardmethods of pencil and paper and solve
 the equations by the method of classical computers and so what we'll do is we'llbuild versions of these systems run them
 and run them under controlled circumstances or we can change themmanipulate them make measurements on
 them and find out all the things we want to know

Speaker 1 :so in finding out the things we want to
 know about very small systems right now the is there something we can also findout about the macro level about
 something about it the function and forgive me of our brain biologicalsystems the the stuff that's about one
 meter in size versus much much smaller

Speaker 0 :well what the only excitement is about
 among the people that I interact with is understanding black holes that fallsblack holes are big things there are
 many many degrees of freedom there is another kind of quantum system that isbig it's a large quantum
 computer and one of the things we learned is that the physics of largequantum computers is in some ways
 similar to the physics of large quantum black holes and we're using thatrelationship now you asked you didn't
 ask about quantum computers or systems you didn't ask about black holes youasked about brains


Speaker 1 :yeah I bought stuff that's in the middle
 of the - it's different so but black holes are there's something fundamentalabout black holes it feels to be very
 different in the brain yes and they also

Speaker 0 :function in a very quantum mechanical
 way right okay it is first of all unclear to me but of course it's unclearto me I another I'm not a a
 neuroscientist I have I don't even have very many friends who areneuroscientists I would like to have
 more friends who are neuroscientists I just don't run into them very oftenamong the few neuroscientists I've ever
 talked about about this they are pretty convinced that the brain functionsclassically there is not intrinsically a
 quantum mechanical system or doesn't make use of the of the special featuresentanglement coherent superposition are
 they right I don't know I sort of hope that wrongwith just because I like the romantic
 idea that the brain is a quantum system and but I think that I think probablynot
 the other thing big systems can be composed of lots of little systemsmaterials the materials are that we work
 with and so forth are three large systems and a large piece of materialbut they're Bagan they're made out of
 quantum systems now one of the things that's been happening over the last agood number of years is with discovering
 materials and quantum systems which function much more quantum mechanicallythen than we imagine topological
 insulators this kind of thing that kind of thing those are macroscopic systemsbut they just superconductors
 superconductors I have a lot of quantum mechanics in them you can have a largechunk of superconductor so it's a big
 decent material on the other hand it's functioning and its properties dependvery very strongly on quantum mechanics
 and to analyze them you need the tools of quantum mechanics if we can go on to

Speaker 1 :black holes mm-hmm and looking at the
 universe as a information processing system as a computer as a giant computer

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :what's the power of thinking of the
 universe as an information processing system but what is perhaps its usebesides the mathematical use of
 discussing black holes and your famous debates and ideas around that to humanbeings or life in general as information
 processing systems well all systems are

Speaker 0 :information processing systems
 you poke them they change a little bit they evolve all systems or information

Speaker 1 :processes there's no extra magic to us
 humans it certainly feels consciousness intelligence feels like magicsure though where does it emerge from if
 we look at information processing what are the emergent phenomena that comefrom viewing the world is an information
 processing system here is what I think

Speaker 0 :my thoughts are not worth much of this
 if you ask me about physics my thoughts may be worth somethingyes if you ask me about this I'm not
 sure my thoughts are worth anything but as I said earlier I think when we dointrospection when we imagine doing
 introspection and try to figure out what it is when we do and we're thinking Ithink we I think we get it wrong I'm
 pretty sure we get it wrong everything I've heard about the way the brainfunctions is so counterintuitive for
 example you have neurons which detect the vertical lines you have differentneurons which detect lines at 45 degrees
 you have different neurons I never imagined that there were whole circuitswhich were devoted to vertical lines in
 the brain yeah doesn't seem to we where when my brain works my brain seems towork put my finger up vertically or if I
 put it horizontally or if I put it this way or that way it seems to me it's thesame the same circuits that are it's not
 the way it works the way the brain is compartmentalized seems to be very verydifferent than what I would have
 imagined if I were just doing psychologicalintrospection about how things work my
 conclusion is that we won't get it right that way but how will we get it right Ithink maybe computer scientists will get
 it right eventually I don't think that any ways near it I don't even thinkthey're thinking about it but by
 computer eventually we will build machines perhaps which are complicatedenough
 and partly engineered partly evolved maybe evolved by machine learning and soforth this machine learning is very
 interesting by machine learning will evolve systemsand we may start to discover mechanisms
 that that have implications for how we think and for what what doesconsciousness thing is all about and
 we'll be able to do experiments on them and perhaps answer questions that wecan't possibly answer by by
 introspection so that's a really

Speaker 1 :interesting point you've in many cases
 if you look even at string theory when you first think about a system it seemsreally complicated like the human brain
 and through some basic reasoning then trying to discover a fundamentallow-level behavior of the system you
 find out that it's actually much simpler you one have you you know is thatgenerally the process and to do you have
 that also hope for biological systems as well for all the kinds of stuff we'restudying at the human level of course


Speaker 0 :physics always begins by trying to find
 the simplest version of something an analyzer yeah I mean there are lots ofexamples where physics has taken very
 complicated systems analyze them and found simplicity in them for sure I saidsuperconductors before it's an obvious
 one a superconductor seems like monstrously complicated thing with allsorts of crazy electrical properties
 magnetic properties and so forth and when it finally is boiled down throughits simplest elements it's a very simple
 quantum mechanical phenomenon called spontaneous symmetry breaking and whichwe in other context we learned about and
 we're very familiar with so yeah I mean yes we do take complicated things makethem simple but what we don't want to do
 is take things which are intrinsically complicated and fool ourselves intothinking that we can make them simple we
 don't want to make I don't know who said this but we don't want to make themsimpler than they really are
 right okay is the brain a thing which ultimately functions bysome simple rules or is it just
 complicated in terms of artificial

Speaker 1 :intelligence nobody really knows what
 are the limits of our current approaches you mentioned machine learning how do wecreate human level intelligence it seems
 that there's a lot of very smart physicists who perhaps oversimplify thenature of intelligence and think of it
 as information processing and therefore that it doesn't seem to be anytheoretical reason why we can't
 artificially create a human level or super human level intelligence in factthe reasoning goes if you create human
 level intelligence the same approach you just used to create human levelintelligence should allow you to create
 superhuman level intelligence very easily exponentially so what do youthink that way of thinking that comes
 from physicists is all about I wish I

Speaker 0 :knew but there's a particular reason why
 I wish I knew I have a second job I consult for Googleah not for Google for Google X I am the
 senior academic advisor third to a group of machine learning physicists at nowthat sounds crazy because I know nothing
 about the subject I know very little about the subject on the other hand I'mgood at giving advice so I give them
 advice on things anyway I see these young physicists who areapproaching the machine learning problem
 there is a myth there is a real machine learning problem mainly why does it workas well as it does it nobody really
 seems to understand why it is capable of doing the kind of generalizations thatit does and so forth and there are three
 groups of people who have thought about this there are the engineers theengineers are incredibly smart but they
 tend not to think as hard about why the thing is working as much as they do howto use it obviously they provided a lot
 of data and it is they who demonstrated that machine learning can work muchbetter than you have any right to expect
 the machine learning systems are systems that the system is not too differentthan the kind of systems if this is a
 study there's not all that much difference between quantum constructionof mathematics physically yes but in the
 structure the mathematics between a tension network designed to describe aquantum system on the one hand and the
 kind of networks that are used in machine learning so they're more andmore I think young physicists are being
 drawn to this field of machine learning some very very good ones I work with anumber of very good ones not on machine
 learning but having lunch on having

Speaker 1 :lunch yeah and I can tell you they are


Speaker 0 :super smart they don't seem to be so
 arrogant about their physics backgrounds that they think they can do things thatnobody else can do
 but those physics way of thinking I think will add will I had great value toUM
 will bring value to the machine learning I believe it will and I think it already

Speaker 1 :has and what time scale do you think
 predicting the future becomes useless in your long experience and being surprisedat new discoveries sometimes a day


Speaker 0 :sometimes 20 years there are things
 which I thought we were very far from understanding which practically in asnap of the fingers or a blink of the
 eye suddenly became understood completely surprising for methere are other things which I looked at
 and I said we're not gonna understand these things for 500 years in particularquantum gravity the scale for that was
 20 years 25 years and we understand a lot and we don't understand itcompletely now by any means but we're I
 thought it was 500 years to make any progress it turned out to be very veryfar from that it turned out to be more
 like 20 or 25 years from the time when I thought it was 500 years so for me can

Speaker 1 :we jump around quantum gravity some
 basic ideas in physics what is the dream of string theory mathematically what isthe hope where does it come from what
 problems are trying to solve I don't

Speaker 0 :think the dream of string theory is any
 different than the dream of fundamental theoretical physics altogether

Speaker 1 :understanding a unified theory of
 everything I I don't like thinking of

Speaker 0 :string theory as a subject unto itself
 with people called string theorists who are the practitioners of this thingcalled string theory I much prefer to
 think of them as theoretical physicists trying to answer deep fundamentalquestions about nature in particular
 gravity in particular gravity and it's connection with quantum mechanics andwho at the present time find string
 theory a useful tool rather than saying there's a subject called stringtheorists I don't like being referred to
 as a string theorists yes but as a tool

Speaker 1 :is it useful to think about our nature
 in multiple dimensions the strings vibrating I believe it is useful I'll

Speaker 0 :tell you what the main use of it has
 been up till now well has had a number of main uses originally string theorywas invented then I know there I was
 there I was right at the spot where it was being invented literally and it wasbeing invented to understand hey groans
 hey drones are sub-nuclear particles protons neutrons mesons andat that time the late 60s early
 seventies it was clear from experiment that these particles call hydrants hadcould vibrate could rotate could do all
 the things that a little closed string can do and it was and is a valid andcorrect theory of these hydrants it's
 been experimentally tested and that is a done deal it had a second life as atheory of gravity the same basic
 mathematics except on a very very much smaller distance scale the objects ofgravitation are nineteen orders of
 magnitude smaller than a proton but the same mathematics turned up the samemathematics turned up what has been its
 value its value is that it's mathematically rigorous in many ways andenabled us to to find to find
 mathematical structures which have both quantum mechanics and gravity with rigorwe can test out ideas we can test out
 ideas we can't test them in the laboratory that nineteen orders ofmagnitude too small or things that were
 interested in but we can test them out mathematically and analyze theirinternal consistency by now forty years
 ago thirty five years ago so forth people very very much questioned theconsistency between gravity and quantum
 mechanics Stephen Hawking was very famous for it rightly sonow nobody questions that consistency
 anymore they don't because we have mathematically precise string theorieswhich contain both gravity and quantum
 mechanics in a consistent way so it's provided that um that certaintythat quantum mechanics and gravity can
 coexist that's not a small thing that's a very huge thing it's a huge thing

Speaker 1 :Einstein be proud


Speaker 0 :Einstein he might be appalled I don't
 know I'm like a very much yeah he would certainly be struck by it yeah I thinkthat maybe at this time its biggest
 contribution to physics in illustrating almost definitively that quantummechanics and gravity are very closely
 related and not inconsistent with each

Speaker 1 :other is there a possibility of
 something deeper more profound that still is consistent with string theorybut is deeper that is to be found well
 you could ask the same theme of quantum

Speaker 0 :mechanics is there something exactly
 yeah yeah I think string theory is just an example of a quantum mechanicalsystem that contains both gravitation
 and in quantum mechanics so is there something underlying quantum mechanics

Speaker 1 :perhaps something deterministic so have


Speaker 0 :something deterministic my friend far
 out it wolf whose name you may know he's a very famous physicist Dutch not asfamous as he should be but the heart


Speaker 1 :dispels names it's hard to say his name


Speaker 0 :you know it's easy to spelling ' he's
 only person I know his name begins with an apostrophe and he's one of my heroesin physics and it's a little younger
 than me but it's nonetheless one of my heroesthe Tufte believes that there was some
 sub structure to the world which is classical in character the deterministicin character which somehow by some
 mechanism that he has a hard time spelling out emerges as quantummechanics I don't the wavefunction is


Speaker 1 :somehow emergent the wavefunction and


Speaker 0 :not just the wavefunction but the whole
 making the whole thing that goes with quantum mechanics uncertainty and pangomeant all these things are emergent do
 you think quantum mechanics is the

Speaker 1 :bottom of the well as is the right here


Speaker 0 :I think is here I think is where you
 have to be humble here's where humility comes I don't think anybody should sayanything is the bottom of the well at
 this time yes I think we I think we can reasonably say I can reasonably say whenI look into the well I can't see past
 quantum mechanics I don't see any reason for it to be anything beyond quantummechanics I think a tuft is a Sperry
 interesting and deep questions I don't like his answers well again let me ask

Speaker 1 :if we look at the deepest nature of
 reality with whether it's deterministic or unobservedis probabilistic what does that mean for
 our human level of ideas of free will is there any connection whatsoever fromthis perception perhaps illusion of free
 will that we have and the fundamental nature of reality the only thing I can

Speaker 0 :say is I am I am puzzled by that as much
 as you are the illusion of it the

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :illusion of consciousness the illusion
 of free will the illusion of self does

Speaker 1 :that connect to how can a physical


Speaker 0 :system do that and and I am as puzzled
 as anybody there's echoes of it in the

Speaker 1 :observer effect yeah so do you
 understand what it means to be an

Speaker 0 :observer I understand it at a technical
 level an observer is a system with enough degrees of freedom that it canrecord information and which can become
 entangled with the thing that's measuring entanglement is the key when asystem which we call an apparatus or an
 observer same thing interacts with the system that it's observing it doesn'tjust look at it it becomes physically
 entangled with it and it's that entanglement which we call anobservation or measure
 now does that satisfy me personally as an observer hmm yes and no I find itvery satisfying that we have a
 mathematical representation of what it means to observe a system you are

Speaker 1 :observing stuff right now
 yeah the conscious level right is you think there's echoes of that kind ofentanglement in our macro scale yes


Speaker 0 :absolutely for sure we're entangled with
 quantum mechanically entangled with everything in this room if we weren't ofand it was just well we wouldn't be
 observing it but on the other hand you can ask though I really am I reallycomfortable with it and I'm
 uncomfortable with it in the same way that I can never get comfortable withfive dimensions my my brain isn't wired
 for it are you comfortable with four

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :dimensions a little bit more because I
 can always imagine the fourth dimension this time so the arrow of time are you

Speaker 1 :comfortable with that arrow do you think
 time is an emergent phenomena or is it's fundamental to nature that is a big

Speaker 0 :question in physics right now all the
 physics that we do or at least that the people that I am comfortable withtalking to my my friends yeah my friends
 no we all ask the same question that you just asked in space we have a prettygood idea is emergent and it emerges out
 of tan tangle mint and other other thingstime always seems to be built into our
 equations as just what Newton pretty much were for Newton modified a littlebit by Einstein would have called time
 and and mostly in our equations it is not emergent time in physics iscompletely symmetric forward and


Speaker 1 :bathymetric so you don't really need to
 think about the area of time for most physical phenomena the most microscopic

Speaker 0 :phenomena no it's only when the
 phenomena involves systems which are big enough for thermalAmyx to become important the entropy to
 become important for small subsets a small system entropy is not a goodconcept an entropy is something which
 which emerges out of large numbers it's a probabilistic idea it's astatistical idea and it's a
 thermodynamic idea thermodynamics requires lots and lots and lots oflittle sub structures okay so it's not
 until you emerge at the thermodynamic level that there's an arrow of time dowe understand it yeah I think I think we
 understand better than most people think that most people say they think weunderstand it yeah I think we understand
 it it's just a statistical idea the you

Speaker 1 :mean like second law thermodynamics
 entropy and so on yeah the pack of cards

Speaker 0 :and you're flinging it in the air and
 you look what happens to it yeah but what's random we understand it doesn'tgo from random to simple it goes from
 simple to random but do you think it

Speaker 1 :ever breaks down what I think you can do


Speaker 0 :is in a laboratory setting you can take
 a system which is somewhere intermediate between being small and being large andmake it go backward a thing which looks
 like it only wants to go forward because of statistical mechanical reasonsbecause of the second law you can very
 very carefully manipulate it to make it run backward I don't think you can takean egg Humpty Dumpty who fell on the
 floor yeah and reverse that but you can in a very controlled situation you cantake systems which appear to be evolving
 statistically toward randomness stop them reverse them and make them go backwhat's the intuition behind that how do


Speaker 1 :how do we do that how do we reverse it a
 clue you're saying closed system yeah

Speaker 0 :pretty much closed system yes did you


Speaker 1 :just say that time travel is possible no


Speaker 0 :I didn't say time travel is possible I
 said you can make a system go backward in time and you don't like it go backyou can make it reverse it steps you can
 make it reverse its trajectory yeah how

Speaker 1 :do we do what's the intuition there does
 it have is it just a fluke thing that we can do at a small scale in thelab that doesn't have what I'm saying is


Speaker 0 :you can do it on a little bit better
 than a small scale you can certainly do it with a simple small system smallsystems don't have any sense of the
 arrow of time atoms atoms uh no sense of the arrow of time they're completelyreversible it's only when you have you
 know the second law of thermodynamics is the law of large numbers say you can

Speaker 1 :break the law because it's not you can
 break German isn't the break it but it's

Speaker 0 :hard it requires great care the bigger
 the system is the more to care the more the harder it is you have to overcomewhat's called chaos and that's hard and
 it requires more and more precision for 10 particles you might be able to do itwith a with some effort 400 particles
 it's really hard for a thousand or a million particles forget it but not forany fundamental reason just because it's
 technologically too hard to make the system go backward so so note no time

Speaker 1 :travel for engineering reasons oh no no


Speaker 0 :no what is time travel time travel time
 travel to the future that's easy yes you just close your eyes go to sleepand you wake up in the future yeah yeah


Speaker 1 :good nap gets you there yeah good map
 gets you there right

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :but in reversing the second law of
 thermal is a very difficult engineering effort I wouldn't call that time travel

Speaker 0 :because it gets to me too mixed up with
 what the science fiction calls time-travel right this is just theability to reverse a system you take the
 system and you reverse the direction of motion of every molecule in it thatinput you can do it with one molecule if
 you find a particle moving in a certain direction let's not say a mama particlea baseball you stop it dead and then you
 simply reverse its motion in principle that's nottoo hard and it'll go back along its
 trajectory in the backward direction just running the program backwards

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :running the program backward yeah okay
 if you have two baseball's colliding well you can do it but you have to bevery very careful to get it just right
 now ten baseball's really really tore better yet tend ten billiard balls on anidealized frictionless billiard table
 mm-hmm okay so you start the balls all in atriangle right and you're whack them yep
 depending on the game you're playing you the wacom where you're really carefulbut the you're welcome
 and they go flying off in all possible directions okay try to reverse that tryto reverse that imagine trying to take
 every billiard ball stopping it dated sometime at some point and reversing itsmotion so it was going in the opposite
 direction if you did that with tremendous care it would reassembleitself back into the triangle okay that
 is a fact and you can probably do it with two billiard balls maybe with threebillion balls if you're really lucky but
 what happens is as the system gets more and more complicated you have to be moreand more precise not to make the tiniest
 error because the tiniest errors will get magnified and you'll simply not beable to do the reversal so yeah you
 could that but I wouldn't call that time travel yeah that's something else but if

Speaker 1 :you think think of it it just made me
 think if we think the unrolling of state that's happening as a program if we lookat the world so the idea of looking at
 the world as a simulation as a computer but it's not a computer it's just asingle program a question arises that
 might be useful how how hard is it to have a computer that runs the universe

Speaker 0 :okay so there are mathematical universes
 that we know about one of them is called anti de sitter space where weand it's quantum mechanics well I think
 we could simulate it in a computer and a quantum computer classical computer allyou can do is solve its equations you
 can't make it work like the real system if we could build a quantum computer orbig enough one robust enough one we
 could probably simulate a universe a small version of an anti-de sitteruniverse and that the sitter is a kind
 of cosmology so I think we know how to do that the trouble is the universe thatwe live in is not the anti-de sitter
 geometry it's the decent or geometry and we don't really understand the quantummechanics at all so at the present time
 I would say we wouldn't have the vaguest idea how to simulate a universe similarto our own you know we could ask oh we
 could we build in the laboratory a small version a quantum mechanical version thecollection of quantum computers
 entangled and the couple together which would reproduce the the phenomena thatgo on in the universe even on a small
 scale yes if you were anti de sitter space know if it's the sitter space canyou a slightly describe the sitter space


Speaker 1 :and anti-de sitter space yeah what are
 the geometric properties of big

Speaker 0 :different they differ by a this is the
 sine of a single constant called the cosmological constant one of them isnegatively curved the other is
 positively curved the anti-de sitter space which is the negatively curved oneyou can think of as an isolated system
 in a box with reflecting walls you could think of it as a system of quantummechanical system isolated in an
 isolated environment the sitter space is the one we really live in and that's theone that's exponentially expanding
 exponential expansion dark energy whatever you want to call it and wedon't understand that mathematically do
 we understand not everybody would agree

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :with me but I don't understand
 they would agree with me they definitely would agree with me that I don'tunderstand it


Speaker 1 :what about their an understanding of the
 birth the origin no the bing bang so

Speaker 0 :knows what normally theories there are
 theories my favorite is the one called eternal inflation the infinity can be on

Speaker 1 :both sides on one of the sides and none
 of the sides so what my real opinion

Speaker 0 :okay
 infinity on both sides oh boy yeah yeah that's why is that your favorite because

Speaker 1 :it's the the most just mind-blowing no
 because we want a beginning no why do we

Speaker 0 :want a beginning I practiced it was the
 beginning of course and practice it was a beginning but could it have been arandom fluctuation in an otherwise
 infinite time maybe in any case the the eternal inflation theoryI think if correctly understood it would
 be infinite in both directions how do

Speaker 1 :you think about infinity Oh God


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :so okay of course you can think about
 mathematically I just finished this I

Speaker 0 :just finished this discussion with my
 friend Sergey Brin yes how do you think about infinity I say well Sergey Brin isinfinitely rich how do you test that


Speaker 1 :hypothesis okay essential good lines all
 right yeah so there's no there's really no way to visualize some of these thingslike ya know this is a very good


Speaker 0 :question those physics have any is does
 infinity have any place in physics right right and well I can say is very goodquestion


Speaker 1 :so what do you think of the recent first
 image of a black hole visualized from the event horizon telescope it

Speaker 0 :it's an incredible triumph of science in
 itself the fact that there are black holes which collide is not a surpriseand they seem to work exactly the way
 they're supposed to work will we learn a great deal from it I don't know I can II we might but the kind of things we
 learn won't really be about black holes why there are black holes in nature ofthat particular mass scale and why
 they're so common may tell us something about the structure evolution ofstructure in the universe but I don't
 think it's going to tell us anything new about black holes but it's a triumph inthe sense that you go back a hundred
 years and it was a continuous development general relativity thediscovery of black holes LIGO the
 incredible technology that went into LIGOit is something that I never would have
 believed was gonna happen you know 30 40 years ago and I think it's a magnificentthe structure magnificent thing this
 evolution of general relativity LIGO high precision ability to measure thingson a scale of 10 to the minus 21 so so


Speaker 1 :you're just astonishing though we zoom
 all this just happy for us to this right picture is it different you know you'vethought a lot about black holes is it
 how did you visualize them in your mind and is the picture different than youknow lies that no it simply confirmed


Speaker 0 :you know it's a magnificent triumph to
 have confirmed confirmed a direct observation yeah that Einstein's theoryof gravity at the level of black hole
 collisions actually works is awesome and it's really awesome you know I know someof the people who were involved in that
 they just thought married people yeah and the idea that they could carry thisout I just don't I'm shocked yeah just


Speaker 1 :these little Homo sapiens
 yeah just these little monkeys got

Speaker 0 :together right and took a picture of


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :slightly advanced lemurs I think what


Speaker 1 :kind of questions can science not
 currently answer but you hope might be able to soon well you you've already

Speaker 0 :addressed them what is consciousness for
 example do you think that's within the

Speaker 1 :reach of science I think it's somewhat


Speaker 0 :within the reach of science but I think
 that now I think it's in the hands of the computer scientists and theneuroscientists I'm not a physicist


Speaker 1 :perhaps with the helper haps at some


Speaker 0 :point but I think physicists will try to
 simplify it down to something that they can use their methods and maybe they'renot appropriate maybe we maybe we simply
 need to do more machine learning on bigger scales evolve machines machinesnot only that learn but
 volve their own architecture as a process of learning evolve inarchitecture not under our control only
 partially under our control but under the control of a machine learning I'lltell you another thing that I find
 awesome you know this Google thing that theytaught the computers how to play chess
 yeah yeah okay they taught the computers how to play chess not by teaching themhow to play chess but just having them
 play against each other against each other itself against each other this isa form of evolution these machines
 evolved they evolved and intelligence they evolved in intelligence withoutanybody telling them how to do it and
 we're not engineered they just played against each other and got better andbetter and better
 that makes me think that machines can evolve intelligence what exact kind ofintelligence I don't know but in
 understanding that better and better maybe we'll get better clues as to whatthere goes on your life and intelligence


Speaker 1 :is last question what kind of questions
 can science not currently answer and may never be able to answer yeah

Speaker 0 :is there an intelligence out there
 that's underlies the whole thing you can call them with the G word if you want Ican say are we a computer simulation
 with a purpose is there an agent an intelligent agent that underlies or isresponsible for the whole thing
 does that intelligent agent satisfy the laws of physics does it satisfy the lawsof quantum mechanics is it made of atoms
 and molecules yeah there's a lot of questions and I don't see this it seemsto me a real question


Speaker 1 :it's an answerable question well it's
 answerable the questions have to be

Speaker 0 :answerable to be real some philosophers
 would say that a question is not a question unless it's answerable thisquestion doesn't seem to me answerable
 by any known method but it seems to me real there's no better place to end

Speaker 1 :monitor thank you so much for talking
