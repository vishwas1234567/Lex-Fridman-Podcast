Speaker 1 :the following is a conversation with
 manolas kellis his third time on the podcast he is aprofessor at mit


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and head of the mit computational
 biology group this time we went deep on the sciencebiology and genetics so this is a bit
 of an experiment manolas went back and forthbetween the basics of biology to the
 latest state of the art and the research he's a master at thisso i just said back
 and enjoyed the ride this conversation happened at 7 00 amso it's yet another podcast episode
 after an all-nighter for me and once again since the universe has asense of humor


Speaker 0 :this one was a tough one for my brain to
 keep up

Speaker 1 :but i did my best and i never shy away


Speaker 0 :from good challenge quick mention of

Speaker 1 :to face your demons with a licensed
 professional not just by doing the david goggins likephysical challenges
 like i seem to do on occasion please

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :check out the sponsors in the
 description to get a discount and to support this podcast as a side notelet me say that biology
 in the brain and in the various systems of the bodyfill me with awe every time i think
 about how such a chaotic mess coming from its humbleorigins in the ocean
 was able to achieve such incredibly complexand robust mechanisms of life that
 survived despite all the forces of nature thatwant to destroy it
 it is so unlike the computing systems we humans have engineeredthat it makes me feel that in order to
 create artificial general intelligence and artificial consciousness we may haveto completely rethink
 how we engineer computational systems if you enjoy this thing subscribe onyoutube review it with five stars in

Speaker 0 :at lex friedman and now here's my


Speaker 1 :conversation
 with manolis kalis so your group at mit is trying to understand the molecularbasis of human disease
 what are some of the biggest challenges

Speaker 0 :in your view don't
 get me started i mean irregularities standing human diseaseis the most complex challenge
 in modern science so because human diseaseis as complex as the human genome
 it is as complex as the human brain and it is in many ways even more complexbecause the more we understand disease
 complexity the more we start understanding genomecomplexity and
 epigenome complexity and brain circuitry complexityand immune system complexity and cancer
 complexity and so on and so forth so traditionallyhuman disease was following basic
 biology you would basically understand basicbiology and model organisms
 like you know mouse and fly and yeast you would understand sort ofmammalian biology and animal biology and
 eukaryotic biology in sort of progressive layers ofcomplexity
 getting closer to human phylogenetically and you would do perturbationexperiments in those species
 to see if i knock out a gene what happensand based on the knocking out of these
 genes you would basically then have a way to drivehuman biology because you would you
 would sort of understand the functions of these genes and then if you find thata human gene
 locus something that you've mapped from human geneticsto that gene is related to a particular
 human disease you say now i know the function of the gene fromthe model organisms
 i can now go and understand the function of that genein human but this is all changing this
 is dramatically changed so that that was the old way of doing basic biology youwould start with the animal models the
 eukaryotic models the mammalian models and then you wouldgo to human
 human genetics has been so transformed in the lastdecade or two that human genetics is now
 actually driving the basic biology there is more genetic mutationinformation in the human
 genome than there will ever be in any other species

Speaker 1 :what do you mean by mutation information


Speaker 0 :so perturbations is how you understand
 systems so an engineer builds systems and thenthey know how they work from the inside
 out a scientist studies systems throughperturbations
 you basically say if i poke that balloon what's going to happen and i'm going tofilm it in super high resolution
 understand i don't know aerodynamics or fluid dynamics if it'sfilled with water etc so you can then
 make experimentation by perturbation and then the scientific process is sort ofbuilding models that
 best fit the data designing new experiments that best test your modelsand challenge your models and so forth
 that's the same thing with science basically if you're trying to understandbiological science
 you basically want to do perturbations that then drivethe models so how do these perturbations


Speaker 1 :allow you to understand


Speaker 0 :disease so if if you know that
 a gene is related to disease you don't want to just know that it's related tothe disease you want to know what is the
 disease mechanism because you want to go and intervene sothe way that i like to describe it is
 that traditionally epidemiology which is basically thestudy of disease
 you know sort of the observational study of disease has beenabout correlating one thing with another
 thing so if you if you have a lot of people with liver disease who are alsoalcoholics
 you might say well maybe the alcoholism is driving the liver diseaseor maybe those who have liver disease
 self-medicate with alcohol so that the connection could be eitherway
 with genetic epidemiology it's about correlating changes in the genomewith phenotypic differences and then you
 know the direction of causality so if you know that a particular gene isrelated
 to the disease you can basically say okay perturbing that gene in mousecauses the mice to have x phenotype
 so perturbing that gene in human causes the humans to have the diseaseso i can now figure out what are the
 detailed molecular phenotypes in the human that are related to thatorganismal
 phenotype in the disease so it's all about understandingdisease mechanism understanding what are
 the pathways what are the tissues what are the processes that areassociated with the disease so that we
 know how to intervene you can then prescribe particularmedications that also alter these
 processes you can prescribe lifestyle changes thatalso affect these processes


Speaker 1 :and so forth that's such a beautiful
 puzzle to try to solve like what kind of perturbationseventually have this ripple effect that
 leads to disease across the population and then you studythat for animals
 a mice first and then see how that might possibly connect tohumans how hard is that puzzle of
 trying to figure out how little perturbations might leadto in a stable way to a disease


Speaker 0 :in animals we make the puzzle
 simpler because we perturb one gene at a timethat's the beauty of it's the power of
 animal models you can basically decouple the perturbations you only do oneperturbation and you only do strong
 perturbations at a time in human the puzzle is incrediblycomplex
 because i mean obviously you don't do human experimentationyou wait for natural selection and
 natural genetic variation to basically do its own experimentswhich it has been doing for hundreds
 and thousands of years in the human populationand for hundreds of thousands of years
 across you know the the history leading to thehuman population
 so you basically take this natural genetic variationthat we all carry within us every one of
 us carries six million perturbations so i've donesix million experiments on you
 six million experiments for me six million experiments on every oneof seven billion people on the planet


Speaker 1 :what's the six million correspond to


Speaker 0 :six million unique genetic variants
 that are segregating the human population every one of uscarries millions of polymorphic
 sites poly many morph forms polymorphic means many formsvariants that basically means that every
 one of us has single nucleotide alterations that wehave inherited from mom and from that
 that basically can be thought of as tiny little perturbationsmost of them don't do anything but some
 of them lead to all of the phenotypicdifferences that we see
 between us the reason why two twins are identical is becausethese variants completely determine the
 way that i'm going to look at exactly 93 years of age

Speaker 1 :how happy are you with this kind of data
 set is it uh large enough of the human population ofearth is that too big


Speaker 0 :too small yeah so so the the is it is it
 large enough is a power analysis question and inevery one of our grants we do a power
 analysis based on what is the effect size that iwould like to detect
 and what is the natural variation in the two forms so every time you do aperturbation you're asking i'm changing
 form a into for b form a has some natural genetic varysome natural phenotypic variation around
 it and form b has some natural phenotypicvariation around it
 if those variances are large and the differences between the mean of a andthe mean of b
 are small then you have very little power the further the means go apartthat's the effect size the more power
 you have and the smaller the standard deviationthe more power you have
 so basically when you're asking is that sufficiently largecertainly not for everything but we
 already have enough power for many of the stronger effectsin the more tight distributions so


Speaker 1 :that's a hopeful message that
 there exists parts of the genome that that have a strong effect that hasa small


Speaker 0 :variance that's exactly right
 unfortunately those perturbations are the basis ofdisease in many cases
 so it's not a you know hopeful message sometimes it's a terrible messageit's basically well some people are sick
 but if when if we can figure out what are thesecontributors to sickness
 we can then help make them better and help many other people betterwho don't carry that exact mutation but
 who carry mutations on the same pathwaysand that's what we like to call the
 allelic series of a gene you basically have many perturbationsof the same gene in different people
 each with a different frequency in the human population andeach with a different effect
 on the individual charism so you said uh

Speaker 1 :in the past
 there would be these small experiments on perturbations and animal modelswhat does this puzzle solving process


Speaker 0 :look like today
 so we basically have you know something like seven billion people in the planetand every one of them carries something
 like six million mutations you basically have an enormous matrixof genotype by phenotype
 by systematically measuring the phenotypeof these individuals and the traditional
 way of measuring this phenotype has been to look at one trait at a timeyou would gather families and you would
 sort of paint the pedigrees of a strong effect what welike to call
 mendelian mutation so a mutation that gets transmitted in a dominant or arecessive
 but strong effect form where basically one locusplays a very big role in that disease
 and you could then look at carriers versus non-carriersin one family carries versus
 non-carriers in another family and do that for hundreds sometimesthousands of families
 and then trace these inheritance patterns and then figure out what is thegene
 that plays that role is this the matrix

Speaker 1 :that you're showing
 in in talks or lectures

Speaker 0 :so that matrix is the
 input to the stuff that i saw in talks so basically that matrix hastraditionally been strong effect genes
 what the matrix looks like now is instead of pedigrees instead of familiesyou basically have thousands and
 sometimes hundreds of thousands of unrelatedindividuals
 each with all of their genetic variants and each with theirphenotype for example height or lipids
 or you know whether they're sick or not for a particular traitthat has been the modern view instead of
 going to families going to unrelated individuals with onephenotype at a time
 and what we're doing now as we're maturingin all of these sciences is that we're
 doing this in the context of large medical systems or enormouscohorts
 that are very well phenotyped across hundreds ofphenotypes sometimes with our complete
 electronic health record so you can now start relating not justone gene segregating one family
 not just thousands of variants segregating with one phenotypebut now you can do millions of variants
 versus hundreds of phenotypes and as a computer scientist i meandeconvolving that matrix partitioning it
 into the layers of biology that are associated with every one ofthese elements
 is a dream come true it's it's like the world's greatest puzzleand you can now solve that puzzle by
 throwing in more and more knowledge about thefunction of different genomic regions
 and how these functions are changed acrosstissues
 and in the context of disease and that's what my group and many other groups aredoing
 we're trying to systematically relate this genetic variationwith molecular variation at the
 expression level of the genes at the epigenomic levelof the gene regulatory circuitry and at
 the cellular level of what are the functions that arehappening in those cells at the single
 cell level using single cell profiling and thenrelate all that
 vast amount of knowledge computationally with the thousands of traits that eachof these of thousands of variants


Speaker 1 :are perturbing i mean this is something
 we talked about i think last time so there's these effects at differentlevels that happen you said at a single
 cell level you're trying to see things that happendue to certain perturbations
 and then so it's not just like a puzzle ofum perturbation and disease
 it's perturbation then effect at a cellular levelat an organ level a body like
 how do you disassemble this into like what your group is working onyou're basically taking a bunch of the
 hard problems in the space how do you break apart a difficultdisease
 uh and break it apart into problems that you into puzzles that you can now start

Speaker 0 :solving
 so there's a struggle here computer scientists love hard puzzlesand they're like oh i want to you know
 build a method that just deconvolves the whole thing computationallyand you know that's very tempting and
 it's very appealing but biologists just like to decouplethat complexity experimentally to just
 like peel off layers of complexity experimentally and that's what many ofthese modern tools that you know my
 group and others have both developed and used the fact that wecan now figure out tricks
 for peeling off these layers of complexity by testingone cell type at a time or by testing
 one cell at a time and you could basically saywhat is the effect of this genetic
 variant associated with alzheimer's on human brain human brainsounds like oh it's an organ of course
 just go one organ at a time but human brain has of course dozens ofdifferent brain regions
 and within each of these brain regions dozens of different cell typesand every single type of neuron every
 single type of glial cell between astrocytes oligodendrocytesmicroglia
 between you know all of the neural cells and the vascular cells and the immunecells
 that are co-inhabiting the the brain between the different types ofexcitatory and inhibitory neurons that
 are sort of interacting with each other between different layersof neurons in the cortical layers every
 single one of these has a different type of functionto play in cognition in
 interaction with the environment in maintenanceof the brain in energetic needs
 in feeding the brain with blood with oxygenin clearing out the debris that are
 resulting from the super high energy production of cognition in in humansso all of these things are basically um
 potentially deconvolvable computationally but experimentallyyou can just do single cell profiling of
 dozens of regions of the brain across hundreds of individualsacross millions of cells and then now
 you have pieces of the puzzle that you can thenput back together
 to understand that complexity

Speaker 1 :i mean first of all i mean the human
 brain the cells in the human brain are the mostokay maybe i'm romanticizing it but
 cognition seems to be very complicated so uh separating into the function

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :breaking alzheimer's down to
 the cellular level seems very challengingis that basically you're trying to find
 a way that some perturbation and genomeresults in some obvious
 major dysfunction in the cell you're trying to find something like

Speaker 0 :that exactly so so
 what does human genetics do human genetics basically looks at the wholepath
 from genetic variation all the way to diseaseso human genetics has basically taken
 thousands of alzheimer's casesand thousands of controls matched for
 age for sex for you know environmentalbackgrounds and so forth and then looked
 at that map where you're asking what are theindividual genetic persuasions
 and how are they related to all the way to alzheimer's diseaseand that has actually been quite
 successful so we now have you know more than 27 different locithese are genomic regions
 that are associated with alzheimer's at thisend-to-end level but the moment you sort
 of break up that very long path intosmaller levels
 you can basically say from genetics what are the epigenomic alterationsat the level of gene regulatory elements
 where that genetic variant perturbs the control region nearby that effect ismuch larger


Speaker 1 :you mean much larger in terms of this
 down the line impact

Speaker 0 :or it's much larger in terms of the
 measurable effect this a versus b variance is actually so much cleanlydefined
 when you go to the shorter branches because for one genetic variant toaffect
 alzheimer's that's a very long path that basically means that in the context ofmillions of these six million variants
 that every one of us carries that one single nucleotide has adetectable effect
 all the way to the end i mean it's just mind-boggling that that's even possiblebut indeed yeah but indeed there are
 such effects

Speaker 1 :so the hope is or the most
 scientifically speaking the the most effective place where to detectthe alteration that results in disease
 is earlier on in the pipeline as early as

Speaker 0 :possible it's
 it's a trade-off if you go very early on in the pipelinenow each of these epigenomic alterations
 for example this enhancer control region is active maybe 50 less which is adramatic effect
 now you can ask well how much does changing one regulatory region in thegenome
 in one cell type change disease well that path is now longso if you instead look at expression
 the path between genetic variation the expression of one gene goes through manyenhancer regions
 and therefore it's a subtler effect at the gene level but then now you'recloser because
 one gene is acting on you know in the context of only 20 000 other genesas opposed to one enhancer acting in the
 context of two million other enhancers so you basically now have geneticepigenomic the circuitry
 transcriptomic the gene expression level and thencellular where you can basically say i
 can measure various properties of those cellswhat is the calcium influx
 rate when i have this genetic variation what is the synaptic density what is theelectric
 impulse conductivity and so on so forth so you can measure things along thispath to disease and you can also measure
 endophenotypes you can basically measure you knowyour brain activity you can do imaging
 in the brain you can basically measure i don't knowthe heart rate the pulse the lipids
 the amount of blood secreted and so forthand then through all of that you can
 basically get at the path to causality the path todisease


Speaker 1 :and is there something beyond cellular
 so you mentioned lifestyle interventions or changes as a way toor like be able to prescribe changes in
 life style like what what about organs what aboutlike
 the function of the body as a whole yeah

Speaker 0 :absolutely so basically
 when you go to your doctor they always measure you know your pulse they alwaysmeasure your height those measure your
 weight your you know your bmis basically theseare just very basic variables
 but with digital devices nowadays you can start measuring hundreds ofvariables for every individual
 you can basically also phenotype cognitivelythrough tests uh alzheimer's patients
 there are cognitive tests that you can imagine that you that you typically dofor uh cognitive decline these
 minimental you know observations that that you havespecific questions too
 you can think of sort of enlarging the set of cognitive testsso in the mouse for example you do
 experiments for how do they get out of mazeshow do they find food whether they
 recall a fear whether they shake in a new environmentand so forth
 in the human you can have much much richer phenotypes where you canbasically say
 not just imaging at the you know organ level but and all kinds of otheractivities at the organ level
 but you can also do at the organism levelyou can do behavioral tests and how did
 they do on empathy how did they do on memory how did theydo on
 long-term memory versus short-term memory and so forth i love how you're

Speaker 1 :calling that phenotype


Speaker 0 :i guess it is it is but like your


Speaker 1 :behavior
 patterns that might change over over uh over a period of a lifeit's yeah your ability to remember
 things your ability to be yeah empathetic or emotionally yourintelligence


Speaker 0 :perhaps even yeah but intelligence has
 hundreds of variables you can be your math intelligence yourliterary intelligence your
 puzzle-solving intelligence your logic it could be like hundreds of things

Speaker 1 :and all of that is it's we were able to
 measure that better and better so and all that could be connected to theentire pipeline


Speaker 0 :we used to think of each of these as a
 single variable like intelligence i mean that's ridiculousit's basically dozens of different genes
 that are controlling every single variable you can basically think of youknow imagine us in a video game
 where every one of us has measures of you know strength staminayou know energy left and so forth but
 you could click on each of those like five bars that are just the main barsand
 each of those will just give you then hundreds of bars yeah and you canbasically say
 okay great for my you know machine learning taski want someone who i'm a human
 who has these particular forms of intelligence i require now theseyou know 20 different things and then
 you can combine those things and then relate them to of courseperformance in a particular task
 but you can also relate them to genetic variationthat might be affecting different parts
 of the brain for example your frontal cortex versusyour temporal cortex versus your visual
 cortex and so forth so genetic variation thataffects expression of genes in different
 parts of your brain can basically affect your you know musicability your auditory ability your smell
 your you know just dozens of different phenotypescan be broken down into you know
 hundreds of cognitive variables and then relate each of thoseto thousands of genes that are
 associated with them

Speaker 1 :so somebody who loves rpgs role-playing
 games there's uh there's too few variablesthat we can control so i'm excited
 if we're in fact living in a simulation and this is a video gamei'm excited by the quality of of the
 video game the the the the game designer did a hell ofa good job


Speaker 0 :so we're impressed oh i don't know the
 sunset last night was a little unrealistic

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah the graphics exactly come on
 nvidia to zoom back out we've been talkingabout the
 genetic origins of diseases but i think it's fascinating totalk about what are the most important
 diseases to understand and especially as it connects to thethings that you're working on


Speaker 0 :so it's very difficult to think about
 important diseases to understand there's many metrics of importanceone is lifestyle impact i mean if you
 look at kovid the impact on lifestyle has been enormous so understanding kovidis important because it has impacted the
 well-being in terms of ability to have a jobability to have an apartment ability to
 go to work ability to have a mental circle ofsupport
 and all of that for you know millions of americans like huge hugeimpact so that's one aspect of
 importance so basically mental disorders alzheimer's has a huge importance in thewell-being of americans
 whether or not it die it kills someone for many many years it has a huge impactso the first measure of importance is
 just well-being

Speaker 1 :like impact on the quality of life


Speaker 0 :impact on the quality of life absolutely
 the second metric which is much easier to quantify is deaths

Speaker 1 :what is the number one killer the number


Speaker 0 :one killer
 is actually heart disease it is actually killing650 000 americans per year
 number two is cancer with 600 000 americansnumber three far far down the list is
 accidents every single accident combined sobasically you you know you read the news
 accidents like you know there was a huge car crash all over the newsbut the number of deaths number three by
 far 167 000 lower respiratory disease sothat's
 asthma not being able to breathe and so forth 160 000alzheimer's number four number five with
 120 000 and then stroke brain aneurysms andso forth that's 147
 000 diabetes and metabolic disorders etc that's 85 000.the flu is 60 000 suicide
 50 000 and then overdose et cetera you know goes further down the list soof course kovit has creeped up to be the
 number three killer this year with you know more than 100000 americans
 and counting um and you know but but if you think about sort of whatdo we use what are the most important
 diseases you have to understand both the quality of life and thethe sheer number of deaths and just
 numbers of years lost if you wish

Speaker 1 :and and uh each of these diseases you
 can think of as uh and also including terrorist attacks andschool shootings for example


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :things which lead to fatalities you can
 look at as problems that could be solvedand some problems are harder to solve
 than others i mean that's part of the equation somaybe if you look at these diseases if
 you look at heart disease or cancer or alzheimer's or justlike schizophrenia and obesity w like
 not necessarily things that kill you but affect the quality of lifewhich problems are solvable which aren't
 which are harder to solve which aren't i

Speaker 0 :love your question because it puts it in
 the context of a global um effortrather than just a local effort so
 basically if you look at the global aspect exerciseand nutrition are two interventions that
 we can as a society make a much better job at so if youthink about sort of the availability
 of cheap food it's extremely high in caloriesit's extremely detrimental for you like
 a lot of processed food etc so if we change that equationand as a society we made availability of
 healthy food much much easier and chargeda burger at mcdonald's the price that it
 costs on the health system then people wouldactually start buying more healthy
 foods so basically that's sort of a societal intervention if you wishin the same way increasing empathy
 increasing education increasing the socialframework and support would basically
 lead to fewer suicides it would lead to fewer murders it wouldlead to fewer
 you know deaths overall so you know that's something that we as asociety can do you can you can also
 think about external factors versus internal factors so the external factorsare basically communicable diseases
 like covid like the flu etc and the internal factors are basicallythings like you know cancer and
 alzheimer's where basically your your genetics will eventually you knowdrive you there
 um and then of course with all of these factors every singledisease has both a genetic component
 and environmental component so heart disease you know huge then theycontribute
 contribution alzheimer's it's like you know60 plus genetic
 so i think it's like 79 heritability so that basically means that geneticsalone explains
 79 of alzheimer's incidence and yes there's a 21 environmentalcomponent
 where you could basically enrich your cognitive environment enrich your socialinteractions read more books learn a
 foreign language go running you know sort of have a morefulfilling life
 all of that will actually decrease alzheimer's but there's a limit to howmuch that
 that can impact because of the huge genetic footprint so this is fascinating

Speaker 1 :so
 each one of these problems have a genetic componentand an environment component and so like
 when there's a genetic component what can we do about some of thesediseases what what have you worked on
 what can you say that's uh in terms of problems that are solvable here

Speaker 0 :or understandable so my group works on
 the genetic component but i would argue that understanding thegenetic component can have a huge impact
 even on the environmental component why is thatbecause genetics gives us access to
 mechanism and if we can alter the mechanismif we can impact the mechanism we can
 perhaps counteract some of the environmental componentsinteresting so
 understanding the biological mechanisms leading to diseaseis extremely important in being able to
 intervene but when you can intervene what you knowthe analogy that i like to gay
 to give is for example for obesity you know think of it as a giant bathtub offat there's basically fat coming in from
 your diet and there's fat coming out from yourexercise
 okay that's an in out equation and that's the equation that everybody'sfocusing on
 but your metabolism impacts that you know bathtub basically yourmetabolism controls
 the rate at which you're burning energy it controls away the rate at whichyou're storing energy
 and it also teaches you about the various valves that control theinput and the output equation
 so if we can learn from the genetics the valves we can then manipulate thosevalves
 and even if the environment is feeding you a lot of fatand getting a little that out you just
 poke another hole at the bathtub and just get a lot of the fat out yeah

Speaker 1 :that's fascinating
 yeah so that we're not just passive observers of our geneticsthe more we understand the more we can


Speaker 0 :come up with actual treatments
 and i think that's an important uh aspect to realizewhen people are thinking about strong
 effect versus weak effect variants so some variants have strong effects wetalked about these mendelian disorders
 where a single gene has a sufficiently large effectpen and trans expressivity and so so
 forth that basically you can um trace it in families withcases and not cases cases not cases and
 so forth but even the you know butso so these are the genes that everybody
 says oh that's the genes we should go afterbecause that's a strong effect gene i
 like to think about it slightly differentlythese are the genes where genetic
 impacts that have a strong effect were toleratedbecause every single time we have a
 genetic association with disease it depends on two things number one theobvious one
 whether the gene has an impact on the disease number two the more subtle oneis whether there is genetic in variation
 standing and circulating and segregating in the human populationthat impacts that gene some genes
 are so darn important that if you mess with themeven a tiny little amount that person is
 dead so those genes don't have variationyou're not going to find the genetic
 association if you don't have variation that doesn't mean that the gene has norole
 it's simply that the gene it simply means that the gene tolerates nomutations


Speaker 1 :so that's actually a strong signal when
 there's no variation that's so fast

Speaker 0 :exactly genes that have very little
 variation are hugely important you can actuallyrank the importance of genes
 based on how little variation they have and those genes that have very littlevariation but no association
 with disease that's a very good metric to say oh that's probably adevelopmental gene
 because we're not good at measuring those phenotypes so it's genes that youcan tell
 evolution has excluded mutations from but yet we can't see them associatedwith anything that we can measure
 nowadays it's probably early embryonic lethal

Speaker 1 :what are all the words you just said
 earlier in brionic what

Speaker 0 :lethal meaning meaning that if you don't
 have it

Speaker 1 :okay there's a bunch of stuff that um
 is required for a stable functional organismexactly across the board for our entire
 for for entire species i guess if you

Speaker 0 :look at sperm
 it expresses thousands of proteins does sperm actually need thousands ofproteins no
 but it's probably just testing them so my speculation is that misfolding ofthese proteins is an early test for
 failure so that out of the you know millions ofsperm
 that are possible you select the subset that are just not grossly misfoldingthousands of proteins


Speaker 1 :so it's kind of an assert uh that this
 is followed correctly correct yeah this uh just uhbecause
 if this little thing about the folding of a protein is incorrectthat probably means somewhere down the
 line there's a bigger issue

Speaker 0 :that's exactly right so fail fast so
 basically if you look at the mammalian investment ina new born that investment is enormous
 in terms of resources so mammals have basically evolvedmechanisms
 for fail fast where basically in those earlymonths of development i mean it's it's
 horrendous of course at the personal levelwhen you lose a uh you know your future
 child but in some waysthere's so little hope for that child to
 develop and sort of make it through theremaining months that sort of fail fast
 is probably a good evolutionary principle from anevolutionary perspective for
 mammals and of course humans have a lot of medical resources that youcan sort of give those children a chance
 and you know we have so much more success in sort of giving folks who havethese strong carrier mutations a chance
 but if they're not even making it through the first three monthswe're not going to see them so that's
 why when we when we say what are the most importantgenes to focus on the ones that have a
 strong effect mutation or the ones that have a weakeffect mutation
 well you know the jury might be out because the ones that have a strongeffect mutation
 are basically you know not mattering as muchthe ones that only have weak effect
 mutations by understanding through genetics thatthey have a weak effect mutation
 and understanding that they have a causal role on the diseasewe can then say okay great evolution has
 only tolerated a two percent change in that gene pharmaceuticallyi can go in and induce a 70 change in
 that gene and maybe i will poke another hole atthe bathtub
 that was not easy to control in you know many of the othersort of strong effect genetic variants


Speaker 1 :so okay so there's this beautiful map
 of uh across the population of things thatyou're saying strong and weak effects so
 stuff with a lot of mutations and stuff with littlemutations with
 no mutations and you have this map and it's it lays out the puzzle

Speaker 0 :yeah so so when i say strong effect i
 mean at the level of individual mutations so so basicallygenes where so so
 you have to think of first the effect of the gene on the disease remember how iwas sort of
 painting that map earlier from genetics all the way to phenotypethat gene can have a strong effect on
 the disease but the genetic variant might have aweak effect on
 the gene so basically when you ask what is the effect of that geneticvariant on the disease
 it could be that that genetic variant impacts the gene by a lotand then the gene impacts the disease by
 a little or it could be that the genetic variantimpacts the gene by a little and then
 the gene impacts the disease by a lot so what we care about is genes thatimpact the disease a lot
 but genetics gives us the full equation and what i would argueis if we couple the genetics
 with expression variation to basically ask whatgenes change by a lot
 and you know which genes correlate with disease by a loteven if the genetic variants change them
 by a little then that those are the best places tointervene
 those are the best places where pharmaceutically if i haveeven a modest effect i will have a
 strong effect on the disease whereas those genetic variants that havea huge effect on the disease i might not
 be able to change that gene by this much without affecting all kinds of otherthings


Speaker 1 :interesting so yeah okay so that's what
 we're looking at then what have we been able to find in termsof


Speaker 0 :which disease could be helped again
 don't get me started this is um we have found so much our understandingof disease
 has changed so dramatically with genetics i mean places that we had noidea would be involved
 so one of the worst things about my genome is that i have a geneticpredisposition to
 age-related macular degeneration amd so it's a form of blindness that causesyou to to lose the central part of your
 vision progressively as you grow older myincreased risk
 is fairly small i have an eight percent chance you only have a six percent

Speaker 1 :chance
 you i'm on average yeah by the way when you say my you mean literally yours

Speaker 0 :you know this about you i know this
 about me

Speaker 1 :yeah which is kind of uh
 i mean uh philosophically speaking is a pretty powerful thingso to live with i mean maybe that's uh
 so we agreed to talk again by the way for thelisteners to where we're going to try to
 focus on science today and a little bit of philosophy next time butit's uh interesting to think about
 the more you're able to know about yourself from the genetic information interms of the diseases
 how that changes your own view of life

Speaker 0 :yeah
 so there's there's a lot of impact there and there's asomething called genetic exceptionalism
 which basically thinks of genetics as something very very differentthan everything else as a type of
 determinism and um you know let's talk about thatnext time
 so basically it's a good preview yeah so let's go back to amd so basically withamd
 we have no idea what causes amd you know it was it was a mysteryuntil the genetics were worked out and
 now the fact that i know that i have a predispositionallows me to sort of make some life
 choices number one but number two the genes that lead tothat predisposition give us insights as
 to how does it actually work and that's a place where genetics gaveus something totally unexpected
 so there's a complement pathway which is an immune function pathway thatwas in you know most of the loci
 associated with amd and that basically told us that wow there's an immune basisto this eye disorder
 that people had just not expected before if you look at complementit was recently also implicated in
 schizophrenia and there's a type of microgliathat is involved in synaptic pruning so
 synapses are the connections between neuronsand in this whole use it or lose it view
 of mental cognition and other capabilitiesyou basically have uh microglia which
 are immune cells that are sort of constantly traversing your brainand then pruning neuronal connections
 pruning synaptic connections that are not utilized soin schizophrenia there's thought to be
 a change in the pruning that basically if you don't prune your synapses theright way
 you will actually have an increased role of schizophrenia this is something thatwas completely unexpected
 for schizophrenia of course we knew it has to do with neurons but the role ofthe complement complex
 which is also implicated in amd which is now also implicating schizophrenia was a

Speaker 1 :huge surprise what's the complement
 complex

Speaker 0 :so it's basically a set of genes the
 complement genes that are basically having various immuneroles and as i was saying earlier our
 immune system has been co-opted for many different roles across the bodyso they actually play
 many diverse roles and somehow the

Speaker 1 :immune system
 is connected to the synaptic pruning process exact process

Speaker 0 :exactly so immune cells were co-opted to
 prune synapses how did you figure this

Speaker 1 :out
 how does one go about figuring this intricate connectionuh like pipeline of connections out yeah


Speaker 0 :let me give you another example
 so so alzheimer's disease the first place that you would expect it to act isobviously the brain
 so we had basically this roadmap epigenomics consortium view of the humanepigenome
 the largest map of the human epigenome that has ever been builtacross 127 different tissues and samples
 with dozens of epigenomic marks measured in you knowhundreds of donors so what we've
 basically learned through that is that you youbasically can map
 what are the active gene regulatory elements for every one of the tissues inthe body
 and then we connected these gene regulatoryactive maps of basically what regions
 of the human genome are turning on in every one of different tissueswe then can go back and say where are
 all the genetic loci that are associatedwith disease
 this is something that my group i think was the first to do back in 2010in this ernst nature biotech paper
 but basically we were for the first time able to show that specificchromatin states specific epigenomic
 states in that case enhancers were in fact enriched enriched indisease associated variants
 we pushed that further in the ernst nature paper a year laterand then in this roadmap epigenomics
 paper you know a few years after that butbasically that
 matrix that you mentioned earlier was in fact the first time that we could seewhat genetic traits have genetic
 variants that are enriched in what tissues in the bodyand a lot of that map made complete
 sense if you looked at a diversity of immune traits likeallergies and type 1 diabetes and so
 forth you basically could see that they wereenriching that the genetic variants
 associated with those traits were enriched in enhancers in these generegulatory elements
 active in t cells and b cells and hematopoietic stem cells and so forthso that basically gave us a
 confirmation in many ways that those immune traits were insteadindeed enriching immune cells if you
 look if you if you looked at type 2 diabetesyou basically saw an enrichment in only
 one type of sample and it was pancreatic eyelidsand we know that type 2 diabetes in you
 know sort of stems from the dysregulation of insulinin the beta cells of pancreatic eyelids
 and that sort of was you know spot on super precise if youlooked at blood pressure
 where would you expect blood pressure to occuryou know i don't know maybe in your
 metabolism in ways that you process coffee or something like that maybe inyour brain the way that you stress out
 increases your blood pressure etc what we found is that blood pressurelocalized specifically
 in the left ventricle of the heart so the enhancers of the left technology inthe heart
 contain a lot of genetic variants associated with blood pressureif you look at height we found an
 enrichment specifically in embryonic stem cell enhancers so thegenetic variants predisposing you to be
 taller or shorter are in fact acting in developmental stemcells makes
 complete sense if you looked at inflammatory bowel diseaseyou basically found inflammatory which
 is immune and also bowel disease which isdigestive
 and indeed we saw a double enrichment both in the immune cellsand in the digestive cells so that
 basically told us that this is acting in both componentsthere's an immune component to
 inflammatory bowel disease and there's a digestive component andthe big surprise was for alzheimer's
 we had seven different brain samples we found zero enrichment in the brainsamples
 for genetic variants associated with alzheimer's and this is mind-bogglingour brains were literally hurting what
 is going on and what is going on is that the brainsamples are primarily
 neurons oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in terms of the cell types that makethem up
 so that basically indicated that genetic variants associated with alzheimer'swere probably not acting in
 oligodendrocytes astrocytes or neurons so what could they be acting in well thefourth major cell type is actually
 microglia microglia are resident immune cells inyour brain
 oh nice the immune oh wow and they are cd14 plus which is thissort of cell surface markers uh of those
 cells so their cd14 plus cells just likemacrophages that are circulating
 in your blood the microglia are resident monocytes that are basicallysitting in your brain they're
 tissue-specific monocytes and every one of your tissueslike your your fat for example
 has a lot of macrophages that are resin and the m1 versus m2 macrophage ratiohas a huge role to play in obesity and
 you know so basically again these immune cells are everywhere but basically whatwe found
 through this completely unbiased view of what are the tissues that likelyunderlie different disorders
 we found that alzheimer's was humongously enriched in microglia butnot at all in the other cell types so


Speaker 1 :what what are we supposed to make that
 if you look at the tissues involved is thatsimply
 useful for indication of uh propensity for disease or does it giveus somehow a pathway of treatment


Speaker 0 :it's very much the second if you look at
 the um the way to therapeutics you have tostart somewhere
 what are you gonna do you're gonna basically make assaysthat manipulate those genes
 and those pathways in those cell types so before we know the tissue of actionwe don't even know where to start
 we basically are at a loss but if you know the tissue of action and evenbetter if you know the pathway of action
 then you can basically screen your small moleculesnot for the gene you can screen them
 directly for the pathway in that cell type so you can basicallydevelop a high throughput multiplexed
 you know robotic system for testing the impact of your favorite moleculesthat you know are safe efficacious and
 you know sort of hit that particular gene and so forthyou can basically screen those molecules
 against either a set of genes that act in that pathwayor on the pathway directly by having a
 cellular assay and then you can basically go into miceand do experiments and basically
 sort of figure out ways to manipulate these processesthat allow you to then to go back to
 humans and do a clinical trial that basically says okayi was able indeed to reverse these
 processes in mice can i do the same thing in humansso that the the knowledge of the tissues
 gives you the pathway to treatment but that's not the onlypart there are many
 additional steps to figuring out the mechanism of disease

Speaker 1 :i mean so that's really promising maybe
 uh to take a small step back you've you'vementioned all these puzzles that were
 figured out with the nature paper for i mean you've mentioned a ton ofdiseases
 from obesity to alzheimer's even schizophrenia i think you mentionedand just what is the actual methodology
 of figuring this out

Speaker 0 :so indeed i mentioned a lot of diseases
 and and my lab works on a lot of different disordersand the reason for that is that
 if you look at the if you look at biologyit used to be you know zoology
 departments in both technology departments and you know virologydepartments and so on so forth and mit
 was one of the first schools to basically create a biology departmentlike oh we're going to study
 all of life suddenly why was that even the casebecause the advent of dna and the genome
 and the central dogma of dna makes rna mixed proteinin many ways unified biology you could
 suddenly study the process of transcription inviruses
 or in bacteria and have a huge impact on yeast and fly and maybe even mammalsbecause of this realization of these
 common underlying processes and in the same way that dna unifiedbiology
 genetics is unifying disease studies so you used to haveum you used to have
 uh you know i don't know um cardiovascular disease departmentand uh you know neurological disease
 department and neurodegeneration department and uhyou know um basically immune and cancer
 and so forth and all of these were studied indifferent labs
 you know because it made sense because basically the first step wasunderstanding how the tissue functions
 and we kind of knew the tissues involved in cardiovascular disease and so forthbut what's happening with human genetics
 is that all of that all of these walls and edifices that wehad built are
 crumbling and the reason for that is thatgenetics is in many ways revealing
 unexpected connections so suddenly we now have to bring the immunologiststo work on alzheimer's they were never
 in the room they were in another building altogetherthe same way for schizophrenia we now
 have to sort of worry about all these interconnected aspects formetabolic disorders we're finding
 contributions from brain so suddenly we have to call theneurologist from the other building and
 so forth so in my view it makes no senseanymore to basically say oh i'm a
 geneticist studying immune disorders i mean that'sthat's ridiculous because i mean yeah of
 course in many ways you still need to sort of focus but whatwhat what we're doing is that we're
 basically saying we'll go wherever the genetics takes usand by building these massive resources
 by working on our latest map is now 833 tissuessort of the the next generation of the
 epigenomics roadmap which we're now called epimapis 833 different tissues and using those
 we've basically found enrichments in 540 different disordersthose enrichments are not like oh great
 you guys work on that and we'll work on thisthey're intertwined amazingly so of
 course there's a lot of modularity but there's these enhancers that aresort of broadly active and these
 disorders that are broadly active so basically some enhancers are activein on tissues and some disorders are
 enriching in all tissues so basically there'sthese multifactorial
 and this other class which i like to call polyfactorial diseaseswhich are basically lighting up
 everywhere and in many ways it's you know sort ofcutting across
 these walls that were previously built

Speaker 1 :across these departments
 and the polyfactorial ones were probably the previousstructure departments wasn't equipped to
 deal with those i mean again maybe it's a romanticizedquestion but you know there's
 in physics there's a theory of everything do you thinkit's possible to move towards an almost
 theory of everything of disease from a genetic perspectiveso if this unification continues is it
 possible that like do you think in those terms liketrying to arrive
 at a fundamental understanding of how disease emerges period

Speaker 0 :that unification is not just
 foreseeable it's inevitable i see it as inevitable we have to gothere
 you cannot be a specialist anymore if you're a genomicist you have to be aspecialist
 in every single disorder and the reason for that is thatthe fundamental understanding of the
 circuitry of the human genome that you need tosolve
 schizophrenia that fundamental circuitry is hugely important to solve alzheimer'sand that same circuitry is hugely
 important to solve metabolic disorders and that same exact circuitry is uhhugely important for solving immune
 disorders and cancer and you know every single disease soall of them have the same sub task
 and i teach dynamic programming in my class dynamic program is all about sortof
 not re doing the work it's reusing the work that you do onceso basically for us to say oh great you
 know you guys in the immune building go solve the fundamental circuitry ofeverything and then you guys in the
 schizophrenia building go solve the fundamental circuitry of everythingseparately is crazy so what we need to
 do is come together and sort of have a circuitry group thecircuitry building that sort of
 tries to solve the circuitry of everything and thenthe immune folks who will apply this
 knowledge to all of the disorders that areassociated with
 immune dysfunction and the schizophrenia folkswill basically interact with both the
 immune folks and with the neuronal folks and all of them will be interacting withthe circuitry folks and so forth so
 that's sort of the current structure of my group if you wish sobasically what we're doing is
 focusing on the fundamental circuitry but at the same time we're the users ofour own tools
 by collaborating with many other labs in every one of these disorders that wementioned we basically have a heart
 focus on cardiovascular disease coronaryartery disease heart failure and so
 forth we have an immune focus onseveral immune disorders we have a
 cancer focus on metastatic melanoma and immunotherapyresponse
 we have a psychiatric disease focus on schizophrenia autism ptsdand other psychiatric disorders we have
 an alzheimer's and neurodegeneration focuson huntington disease als and
 you know ad related disorders like frontotemporal dementia and lewy bodydementia
 and of course a huge focus on alzheimer's we have a metabolic focuson the role of exercise and diet
 and sort of how they're impacting metabolicyou know organs across the body and
 across many different tissues and all of them are interfacingwith the circuitry and the reason for
 that is another computer science principle ofeat your own dog food if everybody
 ate their own dog food dog food would taste a lot betterthe reason why microsoft excel and word
 and powerpoint was so important and so successful is because the employeesthat were working on them were using
 them for their day-to-day tasks you can't just simply build a circuitryand say
 here it is guys take the circuitry we're done without being theusers of that circuitry because you then
 go back and because we span the whole spectrum fromprofiling the epigenome
 using comparative genomics finding the important nucleotides in the genomebuilding the basic functional map of
 what are the genes in the human genome what are the gene regulatoryelements of the human genome
 i mean over the years we've written a series of papers on how do you findhuman genes in the first place
 using comparative genomes how do you find the motifsthat are the building blocks of gene
 regulation used in comparative genomics how do you then find how these motifscome together
 and act in specific tissues using epigenomicshow do you link regulators to enhancers
 and enhancers to their target genes usingepigenomics and regulatory genomics so
 through the years we've basically built all this infrastructure forunderstanding what i like to say
 every single nucleotide of the human genomeand how it acts in every one of the
 major cell types and tissues of the human bodyi mean this is no small task this is an
 enormous task that takes the entire fieldand that's something that my group has
 taken on along with many other groups and we have also and that sort of thingsets my group perhaps apart
 we have also worked with specialists in every one of these disordersto basically further our understanding
 all the way down to disease and in some cases collaborating withpharma to go all the way down to
 therapeutics because of our deep deep understandingof that basic circuitry
 and how it allows us to now improve the circuitrynot just treat it as a black box but
 basically go and say okay we need a bettercell type specific wiring that we now
 have at the tissue specific level so we'refocusing on that because we're
 understanding you know the needs from the disease

Speaker 1 :front so you have a sense of the entire
 pipeline i mean one maybe you can indulge me onenice question to ask would be
 how do you from the scientific perspectivego from knowing nothing about the
 disease to going you said uhto go into the entire pipeline and
 actually have a drug or or a treatment that cures thatdisease


Speaker 0 :so that's an enormously long path
 and an enormously great challenge and what i'm trying to argue is thatit progresses in stages of understanding
 rather than one gene at a time the traditional view of biology was youhave one postdoc working on this gene
 and another prosthetic working on that gene andthey'll just figure out everything about
 that gene and that's their job what we've realized is how polygenic thediseases are so we can't have one
 postdoctoral gene anymore we now have to have thesecross-cutting needs and
 i'm going to describe the path to circuitryalong those needs and every single one
 of these paths we are now doing in parallel acrossthousands of genes
 so the first step is you have a genetic associationand we talked a little bit about sort of
 the mendelian path and the polygenic path to thatassociation so the mendelian path was
 looking through families to basically find gene regionsand ultimately genes that are underlying
 particular disorders the polygenic path is basically lookingat
 unrelated individuals in this giant matrix of genotype by phenotypeand then finding hits where a particular
 variant impacts disease all the way to the end and thenwe now have
 a connection not between a gene and a diseasebut between a genetic region and a
 disease and that distinction is not understoodby most people
 so i'm going to explain it a little bit morewhy do do we not have a connection
 between a gene and a disease but we have a connectionbetween a genetic region and a disease
 the reason for that is that 93 of genetic variants that are associatedwith disease don't
 impact the protein at all so if you look at the human genomethere's 20 000 genes there's 3.2 billion
 nucleotides only 1.5 percent of the genomecodes for proteins
 the other 98.5 does not code for proteins if you nowlook at where are the disease variants
 located 93 percent of them fall in thatoutside the genes portion of course
 genes are enriched but they're only enriched by a factor ofthree
 that means that still 93 of genetic variantsfall outside the proteins
 why is that difficult why is that a problem the problem is that when avariant falls outside the gene
 you don't know what gene is impacted by that variant you can't just say ohit's near this gene let's just connect
 that variant to the gene and the reason for that is that thegenome circuitry
 is very often long range so you basically have that geneticvariant that could sit in the intron
 of one gene and an intron is sort of the place between the axons that codefor proteins so proteins are split up
 into exons and introns and every exon codes for a particular subset of aminoacids
 and together they're spliced together and then make the final proteinso that genetic variant might be sitting
 in an intron of a gene it's transcribed with the geneit's processed and then excised but it
 might not impact this gene at all it might actually impactanother gene that's a million


Speaker 1 :nucleotides away so it's just riding
 along even though it has nothing to do with thewith this nearby neighborhood that's


Speaker 0 :exactly right
 let me give you an example the strongest genetic association with obesitywas discovered in this fto gene
 fat and obesity-associated gene so this fto gene was studiedad nauseum people did tons of
 experiments on on it they figured out that fto is infact
 a rna methylation transferase it basicallycrea it sort of impacts something that
 we know that we call the epi transcriptome just like the genomecan be modified
 the transcriptome the transcript of the genes can be modifiedand we basically said oh great that
 means that that ap transcriptomics is hugely involved in obesity because thatthat gene fto is is you know uh clearly
 where the genetic locus is at my group studiedfto in collaboration with you know a
 wonderful team led by melina klausmitzer and what wefound
 is that this fto locus even though it is associated with obesity does notimplicate
 the fto gene the genetic variant sits in the firstintron of the fdo gene
 but it controls two genes irx3 and ir x5 that are sitting 1.2million nucleotides away several genes
 away

Speaker 1 :oh boy uh what am i supposed to feel
 about that because isn't that like super complicated then

Speaker 0 :uh so so the way that i was introduced
 at a conference a few years ago was uh and here's manolis kellys whowrote the most depressing paper
 of 2015 and the reason for that is that the entire pharmaceutical industry wasso comfortable
 that there was a single gene in that locusbecause in some loci you basically have
 three dozen genes that are all sitting in the same region of associationand you're like gosh which ones of those
 is it but even that question of which ones of thoseis it is making the assumption that it
 is one of those as opposed to some random gene just farfar away which is what our paper showed
 so basically what our paper showed is that you can't ignore the circuitryyou have to first figure out the
 circuitry all of those long-range interactionshow every genetic variant impacts the
 expression of every gene in every tissue imaginable acrosshundreds of individuals
 and then you now have one of the building blocks not even all of thebuilding blocks
 for them going and understanding disease

Speaker 1 :so okay so so embrace
 the the wholeness of the circuitry correct but whatso back to the question of starting
 knowing nothing to the disease and and going to thetreatment so
 what are the next steps so you basically

Speaker 0 :have to first figure out the tissue
 and then describe how you figure out the tissue you figure out the tissue bytaking all of these
 non-coding variants that are sitting outside proteinsand then figuring out what are the
 epigenomic enrichments and the reason for that you knowthankfully
 is that there is convergence that the same processes are impacted indifferent ways
 by different loci and that's a saving grace for our field the factthat
 if i look at hundreds of genetic variants associated with alzheimer'sthey localize in a small number of
 processes

Speaker 1 :can you clarify why that's helpful so
 like they show up in the same exact way in the in the specific set of processes

Speaker 0 :yeah so basically there's a small number
 of biological processes that underlie or at least that play themthe biggest role
 in every disorder so in alzheimer's you basically haveyou know maybe 10 different types of
 processes one of them is lipid metabolismone of them is immune cell function one
 of them is neuronal energetics so these are just asmall number of processes but you have
 multiple lesions multiple genetic perturbations that are associated withthose processes
 so if you look at schizophrenia it's excitatory neuron function it'sinhibitory neuron function it's synaptic
 pruning it's calcium signaling and so forthso when you look at disease genetics
 you have one hit here and one hit there and one hit there and one hit therecompletely different parts of the genome
 but it turns out all of those he hits are calcium signaling proteins oh

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :cool
 you're like aha that means that calcium signaling is importantso those people who are focusing on one
 doctors at a time cannot possibly see that picture you have to become agenomicist you have to
 look at the omics the um the holistic pictureto understand these enrichments but you


Speaker 1 :mentioned the convergence thing so the
 the whatever the thing associated with the disease

Speaker 0 :shows up so let me explain convergence
 yeah convergence is such a beautiful conceptso you basically have these four genes
 that are converging on calcium signaling so that basically means that they areacting each in their own way
 but together in the same process but now in every one of these loci youhave
 many enhancers controlling each of those genesthat's another type of convergence where
 dysregulation of seven different enhancersmight all converge on this regulation of
 that one gene which then converges on calciumsignaling
 and in each one of those enhancers you might have multiple genetic variantsdistributed across many different people
 everyone has their own different mutation but allof these mutations are impacting that
 enhancer and all of these enhancers are impacting that geneand all of these genes are impacting
 this pathway and all these pathways are acting in the same tissueand all these tissues are converging
 together on the same biological process of schizophrenia

Speaker 1 :and and you're saying the saving grace
 is that that conversion seems to happen for a lot of these diseases

Speaker 0 :for all of them basically that for every
 single disease that we've looked at we have found an epigenomic enrichmenthow do you do that
 you basically have all of the genetic variants associated with the disorderand then you're asking for all of the
 enhancers active in a particular tissue for 540 disorders we've basically foundthat indeed
 there is an enrichment that basically means that there is commonalityand from the commonality we can just get
 insights so to explain in mathematical termswe're basically
 building an empirical prior we're using a bayesian approach tobasically say great all of these
 variants are equally likely in a particular locusto be important
 energy so in a genetic locus you basically havea dozen variants that are co-inherited
 because the way that inheritance works in the human genome is through all ofthese recombination events
 during meiosis you basically have you know you you inherit maybe threechromosome three for example in your in
 your body it's inherited from four differentparts one part comes from your dad
 another part comes from your mom another part comes from your dad and other partcomes from your mom so basically
 the way that it i'm sorry from your mom's momso you basically have one copy that
 comes from your dad and one copy that comes from your mombut that copy that you got from your mom
 is a mixture of her maternal and her paternalchromosome
 and the copy that you got from your dad is a mixture of his maternal and hispaternal chromosome
 so these break points that happen when chromosomes are lighting upand lining up are basically ensuring
 through these crossover events they're ensuring that everyuh child cell
 during the process of meiosis where you basically haveyou know one spermatozoid that basically
 couples with one oval to basically create one egg to basicallycreate the zygote
 you basically have half of your genome that comes from that and half of yourgenome that comes from mom
 but in order to light up not line them up you basically have these crossoverevents
 these crossover events are basically leading toco-inheritance of that entire block
 coming from the your maternal grandmother and that entireblock coming from your mother grand
 grandfather over many generations these crossover events don't happenrandomly
 there's a protein called prdm9 that basicallyguides the double-stranded breaks
 and then leads to these crossovers and that protein has a particularpreference to only a small number of hot
 spots of recombination which then lead to asmall number
 of breaks between these co-inheritance patternsso even though there are six million
 variants there are six million loci there there's you know this variation isinherited in blocks
 and every one of these blocks has like two dozen genetic variants that are allassociated
 so in the case of fto it wasn't just one variantit was 89 common variants that were all
 humongously associated with obesity which ones of those is the important onewell if you look at only one locus you
 have no idea but if you look at many loci youbasically say aha
 all of them are enriching in the same epigenomic map in that particular caseit was
 mesenchymal stem cells so these are the progenitor cellsthat give rise to your brown fat
 and your white fat progenitor is like

Speaker 1 :the early on developmental substance


Speaker 0 :so you start from one zygote and that's
 a totipotent cell type it can do anything you thendiffer you know that cell divides
 divides divides and then every cell division isleading to specialization where you now
 have a mesodermal lineage and ectodermallineage and endodermal lineage
 that basically leads to different parts of your day or your bodythe ectoderm will basically give rise to
 your skin ecto means outside derm is skinso ectoderm but it also gives rise to
 your neurons and your whole brain so that's a lotof ectoderm mesoderm gives rise to your
 internal organs including the vasculature and you knowyour muscle and stuff like that
 so you basically have this progressive differentiationand then if you look further further
 down that lineage you basically have one lineage that will give rise to both yourmuscle
 and your bone but also your fat and if you go further down the lineageof your fat
 you basically have your white fat cells these are the cells that store energy sowhen you eat a lot but you don't
 exercise too much there's an excess a set of calories a lot excess energywhat you do with those
 you basically create you spend a lot of that energy to create these high-energymolecules
 lipids which you can then burn when you need them on a rainy dayso that leads to obesity if you don't
 exercise and if you overeat because your body is like oh great ihave all these calories i'm going to
 store them more calories i'm going to store themtoo oh more calories and
 the you know 42 of european chromosomes have a predisposition to storing fatwhich was selected probably in
 the you know food scarcity periods like basically as we were exiting africayou know before and during the ice ages
 you know there was probably a selection to those individuals who made it northto basically be able to store energy you
 know a lot more energy so you basically now have this lineagethat is deciding whether you want to
 store energy in your white fat or burn energy in your base fatit turns out that your fat is you know
 we like we we have such a bad view of fatfat is your best friend
 fat can both store all these excess lipids that would be otherwisecirculating through your
 you know body and causing damage but it can also burn calories directlyif you have too much of energy you can
 just choose to just burn some of that as heatso basically when you're cold you're
 burning energy to basically warm your body up andyou're burning all these lipids and
 you're burning all these scatters so what we basically found is thatacross the board
 genetic variants associated with obesity across many of these regions were allenriched
 repeatedly in mesenchymal stem cell enhancers so that gave us ahint as to which of these genetic
 variants was likely driving this wholeassociation
 and we ended up with this one genetic variantcalled rs1421085
 and that genetic variant out of the 89 was the one that we predicted to becausal for the disease
 wow so going back to those steps first step is figure out the relevant tissuebased on the global enrichment second
 step is figure out the causal variant among many variants in this linkagedisequilibrium in this co-inherited
 block between these recombination hotspotsthese boundaries of these inherited
 blocks that's the second step the third step isonce you know that causal variant
 try to figure out what is the motif that is disruptedby that causal variant basically how
 does it act variants don't just disrupt elementsthey disrupt the binding of specific
 regulators so basically the third step there washow do you find the motif
 that is responsible like the gene regulatoryword the building block of gene
 regulation that is responsible for that disregulatory event and thefourth step is finding out what
 regulator normally binds that motif and is nowno longer able to bind and then once you


Speaker 1 :have the regulator can you then try to
 figure out how to what uh after it developed how to fix it

Speaker 0 :that's exactly right you now know how to
 intervene you have basically a regulator you have a gene that you canthen perturb and you say well maybe that
 regulator has a global role in obesity i canperturb the regulator


Speaker 1 :just to clarify when we say perturb like
 on the scale of a human life can a human being be helped

Speaker 0 :of course of course yeah so i guess her


Speaker 1 :understanding is the first step


Speaker 0 :no no but perturbed basically means you
 now develop therapeutics pharmaceutical therapeutics against thator you develop other types of
 intervention that affect the expression of that gene

Speaker 1 :what do uh pharmaceutical therapeutics
 look like when your understandings in a geneticlevel
 yeah sorry if it's a dumb question no no

Speaker 0 :it's a brilliant question but i want to
 save it for a little bit later when we start talking about therapeuticsperfect we've talked about the first
 four steps there's two more so basically the first step is figureout i mean the zeroth step the starting
 point is the genetics the first step after that is figure outthe tissue of action
 the second step is figuring out the nucleotidethat is responsible or set of
 nucleotides the third step is figure out the motifand the upstream regulator number four
 number five and six is what are the targets so number fiveis great
 now i know the regulator i know the motif i know the tissueand i know the variant what does it
 actually do so you have to now trace it to thebiological process
 and the genes that mediate that biological processso knowing all of this can now allow you
 to find the target genes how by basically doing perturbationexperiments
 or by looking at the folding of the epigenome or by looking at the geneticimpact of that genetic variant on the
 expression of genes and we use all three so let me gothrough them
 basically one of them is physical links this is the folding of the genome ontoitself
 how do you even figure out the folding it's a little bit of a tangent but it'sa super awesome technology
 think of the genome as again this massive packaging that we talked aboutof taking two meters worth of dna and
 putting it in something that's a million timessmaller than 2 meters worth of dna
 that's a single cell you basically have this massivepackaging and this packaging basically
 leads to the chromosome being wrapped around insort of
 tight ways in ways however that are functionallycapable of being reopened and reclosed
 so i can then go in and figure out that foldingby sort of chopping up the spaghetti
 soup putting glue and ligating the segmentsthat were chopped up but nearby each
 other and then sequencing through theseligation events to figure out
 that this region of these chromosomes that region of the chromosome were neareach other
 that means they were interacting even though they were far away on the genomeitself
 so that chopping up sequencing and re-gluingis basically giving you folds
 of the genome that we said

Speaker 1 :how does cutting it help you figure out
 which ones were close in the original

Speaker 0 :folding so you have a
 bowl of noodles go on and in that bowl of noodles some somenoodles are
 near each other yes so throw in a bunch of glueyou basically freeze the noodles in
 place throw in a cutter that chops up the noodles into the little piecesnow throw in some ligation enzyme that
 lets those pieces that were free re-ligate near each otherin some cases they re-ligate what you
 had just got but that's very rare most of the timethey will re-ligate
 in whatever was proximal you now have glued the red noodle thatwas crossing the
 blue noodle to each other you then reverse the glue the glue goes away andyou just sequence the heck out of it
 most of the time you'll find red segment withyou know red segment but you can
 specifically select for ligation events that have happenedthat were not from the same segment by
 sort of marking a particular way and then selecting those and then yoursequencing you look for
 red with blue matches of sort of things that were gluedthat were not immediate proximal to each
 other and that reveals the linking of the bluenoodle and the red noodle
 you're with me so far yeah good so we you know we've done these experimentsphysical


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :that's the physical that's step one of
 the physical and what what the physical revealed is topologically associateddomains basically big blocks of the
 genome that are topologically don't you knowconnected together
 that's the physical the second one is thegenetic links it basically says
 across individuals that have different geneticvariants how are their genes expressed
 differently remember before i was saying that thepath between genetics and disease is
 enormous but we can break it up to look at thepath between genetics and
 gene expression so instead of using alzheimer's as a phenotypei can now use expression of irx3 as the
 phenotype expression of gene a and i can look atall of the g
 all of the humans who contain a g at that location and all the humans willcontain a t
 at that location and basically say wow turns out that the expression of thisgene is higher
 for the t humans than for the g humans at that locationso that basically gives me a genetic
 link between a genetic variant a locus or region and the expression ofnearby genes good on the genetic link
 i think so awesome so the third link is the activity linkwhat's an activity link it basically
 says if i look across 833 different epigenomeswhenever these enhancer is active
 this gene is active that gives me an activity linkbetween this region of the dna and that
 gene and then the fourth one is perturbationswhere i can go in and
 you know blow up that region and see what are the genes that change inexpression
 or i can go in and over activate that region and see what geneschange in expression uh so i guess


Speaker 1 :that's


Speaker 0 :similar to activity yeah yeah so that's
 basically it's similar to activity i agree but it's causal rather thancorrelational


Speaker 1 :again i'm i'm a little weird like no no


Speaker 0 :you're 100 on
 it's exactly the same but the perturbation where i go and interveneyes i basically take a bunch of cells so
 you know crispr right crispr is this genome guidance andcutting
 mechanism it's what george like likes to callgenome vandalism so you basically are
 able to one you can basically take aguide rna that you put into the crispr
 system and the crispr system will basically use this guide rna scan thegenome
 find wherever there's a match and then cut the genomeso you know i digress but it's a
 bacterial immune defense system so basicallybacteria are constantly attacked by
 viruses but sometimes they win against theviruses
 and they chop up these viruses and remember as a trophyinside their genome they have this loci
 this crispr loci that basically stands for clusteredrepeats interspersed
 et cetera so basically it's it's an interspersed repeatsstructure where basically you have a set
 of repetitive regions and then interspersed were thesevariable segments
 that were basically matching viruses so when this was first discoveredit was basically hypothesized that this
 is probably a bacterial immune system that remembersthe trophies of the viruses that manage
 to kill and then the bacteria pass on you knowthey sort of do lateral transfer of dna
 and they pass on these memories so that the next bacterium says oh you killedthat guy
 when that guy shows up again i will recognize him and the crispr system wasbasically evolved
 as a bacterial adaptive immune response to sense foreigners that should notbelong
 and to just go and cut their genome so it's an rna guidedrna cutting enzyme or an rna guided dna
 cutting enzyme so there's different systems someof them called dna some of them called
 rna but all of them remember this uh sort ofviral attack so what we have done now
 as a field is you know through the work of you knowuh jennifer donna emmanuel carpenter
 feng zhang and many others is co-opted that systemof bacterial immune defense as a way to
 cut genomes you basically have thisguiding system that allows you to use an
 rna guide to bring enzymes to cut dna at aparticular locus


Speaker 1 :that's so fascinating just so this is
 like already a natural mechanism a natural tool for cutting that wasuseful
 this particular context yeah and we're like well we can use that thing toactually
 it's a nice tool that's already in the

Speaker 0 :body yeah yeah it's not in our body it's
 a bacterial body it was discovered by the by the yogurtindustry
 they were trying to make better yogurts and they were trying to make theirbacteria
 in their yogurt cultures more resilient to virusesand they were studying bacteria and they
 found that wow this crispr system is awesomeit allows you to defend against that and
 then it was co-opted in mammalian systems that don't use anything likethat
 as a as a as a targeting way to basically bring these dna cuttingenzymes
 to any locus in the genome why would you want to cut dnato do anything the reason is that our
 dna has a dna repair mechanism where if a region of the genome getsrandomly cut you will basically scan the
 genome for anything that matches and sort of use it by homologyso the reason why we're deployed is
 because we now have a spare copy as soon as my mom's copy is deactivatedi can use my dad's copy
 and somewhere else if my dad's copy is deactivated i can use my mom's copyto repair it so this is called
 homologous based repair so all you have to do is

Speaker 1 :the
 the cutting and that's it you don't have

Speaker 0 :to do the fixing that's exactly right
 you don't have to do the fixing because it's already built in that'sexactly right but the fixing
 can be co-opted by throwing in a bunch of homologoussegments that instead of having your
 dad's version have whatever other version you'd liketo use


Speaker 1 :so the thing so you you then control the
 fixing by throwing in a bunch of other stuff exactly right

Speaker 0 :that's how you do genome editing so
 that's what crispr is that's what's

Speaker 1 :wonderful in popular culture people use
 the term i've never well that's brilliant that's

Speaker 0 :a crispr regional explanation genome
 vandalism followed by a bunch of band-aids thathave the sequence that you'd like and


Speaker 1 :you can control the
 the choices of band-aids correct yeah

Speaker 0 :and of course there's new generations of
 crispr there's something that's called prime editing that wassort of very very much in the press
 recently that basically instead of sort of making a double stranded breakwhich again is genome vandalism you
 basically make a single stranded break you basically just nickone of the two strands
 enabling you to sort of peel off without sort of completely breaking it upand then repair it locally using a guide
 that is coupled to your initial rna that took you to that location dumb

Speaker 1 :question but
 is crispr as awesome and cool as it soundsi mean technically speaking in terms of
 like as a tool for manipulating our geneticsin the positive uh meaning of the word
 manipulating or is there downsides drawbacks in thiswhole context of therapeutics that we're
 talking about yeah or understanding and so

Speaker 0 :so so um when i teach my students about
 crispr i show them articles with the headlinegenome editing tool revolutionizes
 biology and then i show them the date of thesetwo of these articles and they're 2004
 like five years before crispr was invented and the reason is thatthey're not talking about crispr they're
 talking about zinc finger enzymes that are another way to bring thesecutters to the genome
 it's a very difficult way of sort of designing the right set of zinc fingerproteins the right set of
 amino acids that will now target a particular long stretch of dnabecause you you know for every location
 that you want to target you need to designa particular regulator a particular
 protein that will match that region well there'sanother technology called talens
 which are basically you know just a different way of usingproteins to sort of you know guide these
 cutters to a particular location of the genomethese require a massive team of
 engineers of biological engineers to basicallydesign a set of amino acids
 that will target a particular sequence of your genomethe reason why crispr is amazingly
 awesomely revolutionary is because instead of having this teamof engineers
 design a new set of proteins for every locker that you want to targetyou just type it in your computer and
 you just synthesize an rna guide the beauty of crispr is not the cuttingit's not the fixing
 all of that was there before it's the guidingand the only thing that changes that it
 makes the guiding easier by sort of you know just typing in therna sequence
 which then allows the system to sort of scan the dna to find that

Speaker 1 :so the coding the the engineering of the
 cutter is easier on the uh in terms ofthat's kind of similar to the story of
 deep learning versus uh old school machine learning some of thesome of the challenging parts are
 automated okay so uh but crispr is just onecutting exact technology exactly and
 then there's that's part of the challengesand exciting opportunities of the field
 is to design different cutting technologies yeah yeah

Speaker 0 :so now um we
 you know this was a big parenthesis on crispr but nowyou you know when we were talking about
 perturbations you basically now have the ability to not just look at correlationbetween enhancers
 and genes but actually go and either destroy that enhancer and see if thegene changes in expression
 or you can use the crispr targeting systemto bring in not vandalism and cutting
 but you can couple the crispr system with and the crispr system is calledusually crispr cas9 because cast 9 is
 the protein that will then come and cut but there's a version of that proteincalled dead cast 9 where the cutting
 part is deactivated so you basically use d cas9 dead cas9to bring in an activator or to bring in
 a repressor so you can now ask is this enhancer changing that geneby taking this modified crispr
 which is already modified from the bacteria to be used in humans that youcan now modify the cast 9 to be dead
 cas9 and you can now further modify it to bring in a regulatorand you can basically turn on or turn
 off that enhancer and then see what is the impact on that geneso these are the four ways of linking
 the locus to the target gene and that's stepnumber five
 okay step number five is find the target gene and step number six iswhat the heck does that gene do you
 basically now go and manipulate that geneto basically see what are the processes
 that change and you can basically ask well you knowin this particular case in the fto locus
 we found mesenchymal stem cells that are the progenitors of white fatand brown fat or beige fat
 we found the rs-1421085 nucleotide variant as thecausal variant we found this
 large enhancer this master regulator i like to call it ob1for uh obesity one like the strongest
 enhancer associated with whatever and ob1 was kind of chubby as the actori don't know if you remember him
 [Laughter] yeah so you basically are using thisjedi mind trick to basically find out
 the uh thank you the location of the genomethat is responsible
 the enhancer that harbors it the motif the upstream regulator which is arid 5bfor 80 rich interacting domain 5b
 that's a protein that sort of comes and binds normally that protein is normallya repressor
 it represses this super enhancer this massive 12 000 nucleotidemaster regulatory control region and it
 turns off irx3 which is a gene that's 600 000nucleotides away
 and irix 5 which is 1.2 million nucleotides away

Speaker 1 :so those are what's the effect of


Speaker 0 :turning them off that's exactly
 the next question so step six is what do these genes actually doso we then ask what does rx3 and rx5 do
 the first thing we did is look across individuals for individuals that hadhigher expression of rx3 or lower
 expression rx3 and then we looked at the expression ofall of the other genes in the genome
 and we look for simply correlation and we found that iric 3 and rx-5 were bothcorrelated
 positively with lipid metabolism and negatively with mitochondrialbiogenesis you're like what the heck
 does that mean

Speaker 1 :it doesn't sound related to obesity not


Speaker 0 :at all superficially
 but lipid metabolism should because lipidsis these high energy molecules that
 basically store fat so hyer extreme and rx5 arenegatively correlated with lipid
 metabolism so that basically means that when they turn onlipid metabolism positively when they
 turn on they turn on lipid metabolism and they'renegatively correlated with
 mitochondrial biotins what do mitochondria doin this whole process again small
 parenthesis what are mitochondria mitochondria are little organellesthey arose they only are found in
 eukaryotes u means good karyo means nucleus so truly like a truenucleus so eukaryotes have a nucleus
 prokaryotes are before the nucleus they don't have a nucleusso eukaryotes have a nucleus
 compartmentalization eukaryotes have also organellessome eukaryotes have chloroplasts
 these are the plants they photosynthesizesome other eukaryotes like us have
 another type of organelle called mitochondria thesearose from an ancient species
 that we engulfed this is an endosymbiosisevent symbiosis bio means life sim
 means together so symbiotes are things that live togetherendosymbiosis endomeans inside so
 endosymbiosis means you live together holding the other one inside you sothe pre-eukaryotes engulfed
 an organism that was very good at energy productionand that organism eventually shed most
 of its genome to now have only 13 genes in themitochondrial genome
 and those 13 genes are all involved in energy productionthe electron transport chain so
 basically electrons are these massive super energyrich molecules
 we basically have these organelles that produceenergy and when your muscle exercises
 you basically multiply your mitochondria you basically sort ofyou know use more and more mitochondria
 and that's how you get beefed up so basically the m the muscle sort oflearns how to generate more energy
 so basically every single time your muscles will you know overnightregenerate and sort of become stronger
 and amplify their mitochondrions and so forthso what does mitochondria do the
 mitochondria use energy to sort of do any kind oftask
 when you're thinking you're using energy this energy comes from mitochondriayour neurons have mitochondria all over
 the place basically this mitochondria can multiply as organelles and they canbe spread along the body of your muscle
 some of your muscle cells have actually multiple nuclei they're polynucleatedbut they also have multiple mitochondria
 to basically uh deal with the fact that your muscle isenormous you can sort of span this super
 super long length and you need energy throughout thelength of your muscle so that's why you
 have mitochondria throughout the length and you also need transcription throughthe length so you have multiple nuclei
 as well so these two processeslipids store energy what do mitochondria
 do so there's a process known as thermogenesis thermoheatgenesis generation thermogenesis is
 generation of heat remember that bathtub within and out that's the equation that
 everybody's focused on so how much energy do you consume howmuch energy you burn
 but in every thermodynamic system there'sthree parts to the equation there's
 energy in energy out and energy lostany machine has loss
 of energy how do you lose energy you emanate heatso heat is energy loss so
 um

Speaker 1 :there's which is where the thermogenesis
 comes in thermogenesis

Speaker 0 :is actually a regulatory process that
 modulates the third component of the thermodynamic equationyou can basically control thermogenesis
 explicitly you can turn on and turn offthermogenesis and that's where the


Speaker 1 :mitochondria comes into exactly


Speaker 0 :so irix 3 and rx5 turn out to be the
 master regulators of a process of thermogenesis versuslipogenesis generation of fat so irex
 and rx5 in most people burn heat burn burn calories as heat sowhen you eat too much
 just burn it burn it off in your in your fat cells so if that bathtubhas basically a sort of dissipation
 knob that most people are able to turn oni am unable to turn that on because i am
 a homozygous carrier for the mutation that changes a t into ac
 in the rs1421085 allele a locus a snip i have the risk allele twice frommy mom and for my dad
 so i'm unable to thermogenize i'm unable to turn on thermogenesisthrough irix 3 and rx5
 because the regulator that normally binds here r85b can no longer buybecause it's an 80 rich interacting
 domain and as soon as i change the t into a c it can no longer bind becauseit's no longer at rich


Speaker 1 :but doesn't that mean that you're able
 to use the energy more efficiently you're not generating heat or is it that

Speaker 0 :means that i can eat less
 and get around just fine yes yeah so that's a feature actually it's a featurein a food scarce environment
 yeah but if we're all starving i'm doing great if we all have access to massiveamounts of food
 i'm i'm obese basically that's taken us

Speaker 1 :through the entire process of then
 understanding that why mitochondria and then the lipids are bothno distant or somehow different size of


Speaker 0 :the same coin
 and you basically choose to store energy or you can choose to burn energy

Speaker 1 :and then all of that is involved in the
 puzzle of obesity

Speaker 0 :and that's what's fascinating right here
 we are in 2007 discovering the strongest geneticassociation with obesity
 and knowing nothing about how it works for almost 10 yearsfor 10 years everybody focused on this
 fto gene and they were like oh it must have to dosomething with you know
 rna modification and it's like no it has nothing to do with the function of ftoit has everything to do with all of this
 other process and suddenly the moment you solve thatpuzzle which is a multi-year effort by
 the way and tremendous effort by melina and many many othersso this tremendous effort basically led
 us to recognize this circuitry you went from having some89 common variants associated in that
 region of the dna sitting on top of this gene to knowingthe whole circuitry
 when you know the circuitry you can now go crazy you can now startintervening at every level you can start
 intervening at the arid 5b level you can start intervening withcrispr cas9 at the single
 snip level you can start intervening at iraq 3 and rx5directly there you can start intervening
 at the thermogenesis level because you know the pathwayyou can start interviewing at the at the
 differentiation level where these the decision to makeeither white fat or beige fat the energy
 burning base fat is made developmentally in the firstthree days of differentiation of your
 adipocytes so as they're differentiating you basicallycan choose to make fat burning machines
 or fat storing machines and sort of that's how you populate your your fatyou basically can now go in
 pharmaceutically and do all of that and in our paper we actually did all ofthat
 we went in and manipulated every single aspect at the nucleotide levelwe used crispr cast 9 genome editing to
 basically take primary adipocytes from risk andnon-risk individuals
 and show that by editing that one nucleotide out of 3.2 billionnucleotides in the human genome
 you could then flip between an obese phenotype and a lean phenotype like aswitch
 you can basically take a micelles that are non-thermogenizingand just flipping to thermogenizing
 cells by changing one nucleotide it's mind-boggling it's so inspiring

Speaker 1 :that this puzzle could be solved in this
 way and it feels within reach to then be able tocrack the problem with some of these
 diseases what are so 2007 you mentioned 2000 what are thetechnologies
 the tools that came along that made this possible like whatwhat are you excited about maybe if we
 just look at the buffet of things that you've kind of mentioned is there isthis what's involved
 what should we be excited about what are

Speaker 0 :you excited about
 i love that question because there's so much ahead of us there's soso much um there's
 uh so so basically solving that one locusrequired massive amounts of knowledge
 that we have been building across the yearsthrough the epigenome through the
 comparative genomics to find out the causal variant and thecontrol the controller regulatory motif
 through the conserved circuitry it required knowing this regulatorygenomic wiring
 it required high c of these sort of topologically associated domains tobasically find this long-range
 interaction it required eqtls of this sort ofgenetic perturbation of these
 intermediate gene phenotypes it required all of thearsenal of tools that i've been
 describing was put together for one locus and thiswas a massive team effort
 huge you know investment in time energy money effort intellectual youknow everything


Speaker 1 :you're referring to i'm sorry this one
 basically yeah this one piece this one single paper at least one

Speaker 0 :single locus i like to say that this is
 a paper about one nucleotide in the human genome about one bit ofinformation
 c versus t in the human genome that's one bit of information and we have 3.2billion
 nucleotides to go through so how do you do that systematicallyi am so excited about the next phase of
 research because the technologies that my groupand many other groups have developed
 allows us to now do this systematically not just onelocus at a time but thousands of loci
 at a time so let me describe some of these technologiesthe first one is automation and robotics
 so basically you know we talked about how you can takeall of these molecules and see which of
 these molecules are targeting each of these genes and what do they doso you can basically now screen through
 millions of molecules through thousands and thousands andthousands of plates each of which has
 thousands and thousands and thousands of moleculesevery single time testing um you know
 all of these genes and asking which of these molecules perturb thesegenes so that's technology number one
 automation and robotics technology number twois parallel readouts so instead of
 perturbing one locus and then asking if i use crispr cast 9on this enhancer
 to basically use dcas9 to turn on or turn off the enhanceror if i use crystal cast 9 on the snip
 to basically change that one snip at a time then whathappens but we have
 120 000 disease associated snips that we want to testwe want we don't want to spend 120 000
 years doing it so what do we do we've basicallydeveloped this technology
 for massively parallel reporter assays mpra so in collaboration withtarzan mickelson mary flanders i mean
 jason dura's group has done a lot of that so there'sthere's a lot of groups that basically
 have developed technologies for testing 10 000 genetic variants at atime
 how do you do that you you know we talked aboutmicro array technology the ability to
 synthesize these huge microarrays that allow you todo all kinds of things like measure gene
 expression by hybridization by measuring the genotype of a person bylooking at hybridization with one
 version with a t versus the other version with the twith an with a c and then sort of
 figuring out that i am a risk carrier for obesity based onthese hybridization
 differential hybridization in my genome that says oh you seem to only have thisallele or you seem to have that allele
 microarrays can also be used to systematically synthesizesmall fragments of dna so you can
 basically synthesize these 150 nucleotide long fragmentsacross 450 000 spots at a time
 you can now take the result of that synthesiswhich basically works through all of
 these sort of layers of adding one nucleotide at a timeyou can basically just type it into your
 computer and order it and you can basically order 10000 or 100 000 of these small
 dna segments at a time and that's where awesome molecular biology comes inyou can basically take all these
 segments have a common start and end barcode or sort of like gator like youjust like pieces of a puzzle
 you can make the same end piece and the same start piecefor all of them and you can now use
 plasmids which are these extra chromosomalsmall dna circular segments
 that are basically inhabiting all our all our genomes we basically haveyou know plasmids floating around i mean
 bacteria use plasmids for transferring dna and that's wherethey put a lot of antibiotic resistance
 genes so they can easily transfer them from one but one bacterium to the otherso one bacterium involves a gene to be
 resistant to a particular antibiotic it basicallysays to all its friends hey
 here's that sort of dna piece we can now co-optthese plasmids into human cells you can
 basically make a human cell culture and addplasmids
 to that human cell culture that contain the things that you want to test you nowhave this library of 450 000 elements
 you can insert them each into the common plasmid yeahand then test them in millions of cells
 in parallel

Speaker 1 :and the common plasmid is all the same
 before you add it exactly the rest of

Speaker 0 :the plasmid is the same
 so it's it's called an episomal reporter assayepisome means not inside the genome it's
 sort of outside the chromosomes so it's an episomalassay
 that allows you to have a variable region where you basically test10 000 different enhancers and you have
 a common region which basically has the same reporter geneyou know some can do some very cool
 molecular biology you can basically take the 450 000elements that you've generated and and
 you have a piece of the puzzle here a piece of the puzzle here which isidentical so they're
 compatible with that plasmid you can chop them up in the middleto separate a barcode reporter from the
 enhancer and in the middle put the same geneagain using the same pieces of the
 puzzle you now can have a barcode readoutof what is the impact of 10 000
 different versions of an enhancer on gene expression so we're not doingone experiment we're doing 10 000
 experiments and those ten thousand can be fivethousand
 of different loci and each of them in two versionsrisk or non-risk i can now test


Speaker 1 :tens of these little hypotheses exactly
 and then you can do ten thousand and we

Speaker 0 :can test ten thousand hypothesis at once


Speaker 1 :how how hard is it to generate those


Speaker 0 :ten thousand uh trivial trivial but it's
 biology no no generating the ten thousand istrivial because you basically
 add it by technology you basically have these arraysthat that add one nucleotide at a time
 at every spot

Speaker 1 :oh and yeah so it's printing in it so
 you're able to you're able to control yeah uh supercostly
 is it ten thousand bucks so this isn't millions

Speaker 0 :thousand bucks for ten thousand
 experiments sounds like the right you knowi mean so that's super that's exciting


Speaker 1 :because you don't have to do one thing
 at a time yeah

Speaker 0 :you can now use that technology these
 massively parallel reporter assays to test10 000 locations at a time we've
 made multiple modifications of that technology one wassharper mpra which stands for
 you know basically getting a higher resolution view by tilingthese um these elements
 so you can see where along the region of control are they actingand we made another modification called
 hydra for high you know definition regulatoryannotation or something like that which
 basically allows you to test seven million of these at a time bysort of cutting them directly from the
 dna so instead of synthesizing whichbasically has the limit of 450 000 that
 you can synthesize at a time we basically said hey if we want to testall accessible regions of the genome
 let's just do an experiment that cuts accessible regionslet's take those accessible regions put
 them all with the same end joints of the puzzles and then now usethose to create
 a much much larger much much larger uh array of things that you can test andthen tiling all of these regions you can
 then pinpoint what are the driver nucleotideswhat are the elements how are they
 acting across seven million experiments at a time so basicallythis is all the same family of
 technology where you're basically using theseparallel readouts of the barcodes
 and then you know to do this we used a technology called starseek forself-transcribing uh reporter asses a
 technology developed by alex stark my my former postdoc who's now api overin vienna so we basically coupled the
 starsig the self-transcribing uh reporters where the enhancercan be part of the the gene itself so
 instead of having a separate barcode that enhancer basically acts to turn onthe gene and it's transcribed
 as part of the gene so you don't have to

Speaker 1 :have the two separate parts exactly so


Speaker 0 :you can just read them


Speaker 1 :so there's a constant improvements in
 this whole process yes by the way generating all these optionsare is it basically brute force
 uh how much human intuition is oh gosh

Speaker 0 :of course it's human intuition
 and human creativity and incorporating all of theinput data sets because again the the
 genome is enormous 3.2 billion you don't want to test thatinstead you basically use all of these
 tools that i've talked about already you generate yourtop favorite
 10 000 hypothesis and then you go and test all ten thousand and then from whatwhat comes out you can then go go to the
 next step so that's technology number two sotechnology one number one is robotics
 automation where you have thousands of wells and you constantly test themthe second technology is instead of
 having wells you have these massively parallel readoutsin sort of these pooled asses the third
 technology is coupling crispr perturbationswith these single cell rna
 readouts so let me make another parenthesis hereto describe now single cell rna
 sequencing okay so what does single cellularsequencing mean so
 rna sequencing is what has been traditionally used oh well traditionallythe last 20 years
 ever since the advent of next generation sequencing so basically beforerna expression profiling was based on
 this microarrays the next technology after that was basedon sequencing so you chop up your rna
 and you just sequence small molecules just like youwould sequence the genome basically
 reverse transcribe the small rnas into dna and you sequence that dnain order to get the number of sequencing
 reads corresponding to the expression level ofevery gene in the genome
 you now have rna sequencing how do you go to single cell rna sequencingthat technology also went through stages
 of evolution the first was microfluidics youbasically had
 these or even even chambers you basically had these ways of isolatingindividual cells
 putting them into a well for every one of these cellsso you have 384 well plates and you know
 do 384 parallel reactions to measure theexpression of 384 cells
 that sounds amazing and it was amazing but we want to doa million cells how do you go from you
 know these wells to a million cells you can'tso what what what the next technology
 was after that is instead of using a well for everyreaction you now
 use a lipid droplet for every reaction so you use micro droplets as reactionchambers
 to basically amplify rna so here's the idea you basically havemicrofluidics where you basically have
 every single cell coming down one tube in yourmicrofluidics and you have little
 bubbles getting created in the other way with specific primers that mark everycell with its own barcode
 you basically couple the two and you end up with little bubbles that havea cell and tons of markers for that cell
 you now mark up all of the rna for that one cell with the same exact barcodeand you then lice all of the droplets
 and you sequence the heck out of that and you have for every rna moleculea unique identifier that tells you what
 cell was it on that is such good

Speaker 1 :engineering
 microfluidics and uh using some kind of primer to put it putup put a label on the thing
 i mean i don't you're making it sound easy i assume it's it's beautiful rightchallenging but it's gorgeous yeah


Speaker 0 :so there's the next generation
 engineering yeah so that's the second generationnext generation is forget the
 microfluidics all together just use big bottleshow can you possibly do that with big
 bottles so here's the idea you dissociate all of your cells or allof your nuclei
 from complex cells like brain cells that you know are very long and sticky so youcan't do that
 so you know if you have blood cells or if you have you know neuronal nuclei orbrain nuclei
 you can basically dissociate let's say a million cellsyou now want to add a unique barcode a
 unique barcode in each one of a million cellsusing only big bottles i can't possibly
 do that sounds crazy but here's the idea you use a hundred ofthese bottles
 you randomly shuffle all your million cellsand you throw them into the hundred
 bottles randomly completely random you add one barcode out of 100 to everyone of those cells
 you then you now take them all out you shuffle them againand you throw them again into the same
 hundred bottles but now in a different randomizationand you add a second barcode so every
 cell now has two barcodes you take them out againyou shuffle them and you throw them back
 in another third barcode is adding randomly fromthe same hundred barcodes
 you've now labeled every cell probabilisticallybased on the unique path that he took of
 which of a hundred bottles to go for the first timewhich of 100 bottles a second time and
 which of 100 bottles a third time a hundred times 100 times 100 is amillion unique barcodes
 in every single one of these cells without ever using microfluidic veryclever that's beautiful right computer


Speaker 1 :science perspective that's very clever


Speaker 0 :so you now have the single cell
 sequencing technology you can use the wells you can use thebubbles or you can use the bottles and
 you know sort of you have way bubbles still sound prettydamp because bubbles are awesome and
 that's basically the main technology that we're using okay so the evolves isthe main technology
 so so there are kids now that companies to sellto basically carry out single cell or
 any sequencing that you know you can basically for two thousand dollarsyou can basically get ten thousand cells
 from one sample and for every one of those cells youbasically have the transcription
 of thousands of genes and you know of course the data for any onecell is noisy but being computer
 scientists we can aggregate the data from all ofthose cells together
 across thousands of individuals together to basically make very robust inferencesokay so the third technology is
 basically single cell rna sequencing that allows you to nowstart asking
 not just what is the brain expression level difference of that genetic variantbut what is the expression difference of
 that one genetic variant across every single subtype of braincell
 how is the variance changing you can't justyou know with a brain sample you can
 just ask about the mean what is the average expression if iinstead have
 3 000 cells that are neurons i can ask not just what is the neuronalexpression
 i can say for layer 5 excitatory neurons of which i have i don't know 300 cellswhat is the variance
 that this genetic variant has so suddenlyit's amazingly more powerful i can
 basically start asking about this middle layer of geneexpression at unprecedented levels
 and when you look at the average it

Speaker 1 :washes out some potentially
 important signal that corresponds to ultimately the disease completely

Speaker 0 :yeah so that i can do that at the rna
 level but i can also do that at the dna levelfor the epigenome
 so remember how before i was telling you about all these technologies we're usingto probe the epigenome
 one of them is dna accessibility so what we're doing in my lab is that from thesame
 dissociation of say a brain sample where you now have all these tens of thousandsof cells floating around
 you basically take half of them to do rna profilingand the other have to do epigenome
 profiling both at the single cell level so that allows you to now figure outwhat are
 the millions of dna enhancers that are accessible in every one of tensof thousands of cells
 and computationally we can now take the rna and the dnareadout and group them together to
 basically figure out how is every enhancerrelated to every gene and remember these
 sort of enhancer gene linking that we were doing across 833 samples833 is awesome don't get me wrong but
 10 million is way more awesome so we can now look at correlated activityacross 2.3 million enhancers and 20 000
 genes in each of millions of cells tobasically start piecing together the
 regulatory circuitry of every single type of neuron everysingle type of astrocytes
 oligodendrocyte microglial cell inside the brains of1500 individuals that we've sampled
 across multiple different brain regions across both dna and rnaso that's the data set that my team
 generated last year alone so in one year we basically generated 10million cells
 from human brain across a dozen different disordersacross schizophrenia alzheimer's frontal
 temporal dementia louis body dementia als you know huntington's diseasepost-traumatic stress disorder autism
 like you know bipolar disorder healthy aging etc so it's possible that

Speaker 1 :even just within that
 data set lie a lot of keys

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :to understanding these diseases
 and then be able to like directly leads to then treatment

Speaker 0 :correct correct so basically we are now
 motivating yeah so our computational team is in heaven right now and we'relooking for people i mean if
 you have super how much does this decision

Speaker 1 :so this is a very interesting kind of
 side question how much of this is biology how much ofthis is computation
 so you have the computational biology group but

Speaker 0 :how much of are you should


Speaker 1 :should you be comfortable with biology
 to be able to solve some of these problemsif you just find if you put several of
 the hats you were on fundamentally are you thinking like acomputer scientist here


Speaker 0 :you have to this is the only way
 as i said we are the descendants of the first digital computer we're trying tounderstand the digital computer we
 understand we're trying to understand the circuitry the logicof this digital you know core computer
 and all of these analog layers surrounding it soyou you know the case that i've been
 making is that you cannot think one gene at a timethe traditional biology is dead there's
 no way you cannot solve disease with traditional biologyyou need it as a component once you've
 figured out rx3 and rx5 you now can then say hey have you guysworked on those genes with your single
 gene approach we'd love to know everything you knowand if you haven't we now know how
 important these genes are let's now launch a single gene programto dissect them and understand them
 but you cannot use that as a way to dissect disease you have to thinkgenomically
 you have to think from the global perspective and you have to build thesecircuits
 systematically so we need numbers of computer scientists who areinterested and willing
 to dive into this data you know fully fully inand sort of extract meaning we need
 computer science people who can understand sort of machine learning andinference and sort of you know decouple
 these matrices come up with super smart ways of sort ofdissecting them
 but we also need by all computer scientists who understand biologywho are able to design the next
 generation of experiments because many of these experiments no onein the right mind would design them
 without thinking of the analytical approach that you would use todeconvolve the data afterwards
 right because it's massive amounts of ridiculously noisy dataand if you don't have the computational
 pipeline in your head before you even design theexperiment you would never design the
 experiment that way

Speaker 1 :that's brilliant so you in designing the
 experiment you have to see the entirety of the computational pipeline that

Speaker 0 :drives the design
 that that even drives the necessity for that designbasically you know if you didn't have a
 computer scientist way of thinking you would never design these hugelycombinatorial
 massively parallel experiments so that's why you need interdisciplinaryteams you need teams
 and and i want to i want to sort of clarify that what do we mean bycomputational biology group
 the focus is not on computational the focus is on the biologyso we are a biology group what type of
 biology computational biology yeah the type ofbiology
 that uses the whole genome that's the type of biology that designsexperiments genomic experiments that can
 only be interpreted in the context of the whole genome

Speaker 1 :right so it's it's philosophically
 looking at biology as a computer

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :correct correct so which is a
 in the context of the history of biology is a big transformation

Speaker 0 :yeah yeah you can think of the name as
 what do we do only computation that's not true but howdo we study it
 only computationally that is true so all of these single cell sequencingcan now be coupled with the technologies
 that we talked about earlier for perturbationso here's a crazy thing instead of using
 these wells and these robotic systems for doing onedrug at a time
 or for perturbing one gene at a time in thousands of wellsyou can now do this using a pool of
 cells and single cell or any sequencing howyou basically can take
 these perturbations using crispr and instead of using a single guide rnayou can use a library of guide rnas
 generated exactly the same way using this array technologyso you synthesize a thousand different
 guide rnas you now take each of these guide rnasand you insert them in a pool of cells
 where every cell gets one perturbation and you use crispr editingor crispr uh so with either crispr cas9
 to edit the gina with these thousand perturbations or theor with the activation or with the
 repression and you now can have a single cellreadout
 where every single cell has received one of these modifications and you can nowin massively parallel ways
 couple the perturbation and the readout in a single experiment how

Speaker 1 :are you tracking which perturbations


Speaker 0 :each cell received so there's there's
 ways of doing that but basically one way is to make thatperturbation an expressible
 vector so that part of your rna reading is actuallythat perturbation itself so you can
 basically put it in a expressible part so you can self-driveit
 so the the point that i want to get across is that the sky is the limityou basically have these tools these
 building blocks of molecular biology you have this massive data sets ofcomputational biology
 you have this huge ability to sort of usemachine learning and statistical methods
 and you know linear algebra to sort of reduce the dimensionality of all thesemassive data sets
 and then you end up with a series of actionable targets that you can thencouple with pharma and just go after
 systematically so the ability to sort of bring geneticsto the epigenomics to the
 transcriptomics to the cellular readouts using these sort of high throughputperturbation technology that i'm talking
 about and ultimately to the organismal throughthe
 electronic health record endophenotypes and ultimately the diseasebattery of assays at the cognitive level
 at the physiological level and you know every other levelthis there is no better or more exciting
 field in my view to be a computer scientist then or to bea scientist in period
 basically this confluence of technologies of computationof data of insight and of tools for
 manipulation is unprecedented in human history and ithink this is what's shaping
 the next century to really be a transformative century for our speciesand for our planet


Speaker 1 :so you think the 21st century will be
 remembered for the big leaps in biology andunderstanding and
 alleviation of biology if you look at

Speaker 0 :the path
 between discovery and therapeutics it's been on the order of 50 yearsit's been shortened to 40 30 20 and now
 it's on the order of 10 years but the huge number of technologies thatare
 going on right now for discovery will result undoubtedly in the mostdramatic manipulation of human biology
 that we've ever seen in the history of humanity in the nextfew years do you think we might be able


Speaker 1 :to cure some of the diseases we started
 this conversation with

Speaker 0 :absolutely absolutely it's it's only a
 matter of time basically the complexity is enormous and i don't want tounderestimate the complexity
 but the number of insides is unprecedentedand the ability to manipulate is
 unprecedented and the ability to deliver these small molecules and othernon-traditional medicine perturbations
 there's a lot of sort of new gen there's a new generationof perturbations that you can use at the
 dna level at the rna level at the you know microrna level uh thegenomic level
 there's there's a battery of new generations of perturbationsif you couple that with cell type
 identifiers that can basically sense when you are inthe right cell based on the specific
 combination and then turn on that intervention for that cellyou can now think of combinatorial
 interventions where you can basically sort of feed asynthetic biology construct to someone
 that will basically do different things in different cellsso basically for cancer this is one of
 the therapeutics that our collaborator ron weiss is usingto basically start sort of engineering
 these circuits that will use microrna sensors of the environment to sort ofknow if you're in a tumor cell
 or if you're in an immune cell or if you're in stromal cells and so forthand basically turn on particular
 interventions there you can sort of create constructs that are tuned to onlythe liver cells or only the heart cells
 or only the you know uh you know brain cells andthen
 have these new generations of therapeutics coupled with this immenseamount
 of knowledge on the sort of which targets to choose and what biologicalprocesses to measure
 and how to intervene my view is that diseaseis going to be fundamentally altered and
 alleviated as we go forward

Speaker 1 :next time we talk we'll talk about the
 philosophical implications that the effect of life but let's stick tobiology
 for just a little longer we did pretty good today we still stuck to the sciencewhat um what are you excited in terms of
 uh the future of this of this field thetechnologies
 in your own group in your own mind you're leading the world at mit in thescience
 and the engineering of this work so what are you excited about here i could

Speaker 0 :not be more excited
 we are one of many many teams who are working on thisin my team the most exciting parts are
 um you know manifold so basically we've nowassembled this battery of technologies
 we've assembled these massive massive data sets and now we're really sort ofin the stage of uh our our team's path
 of generating disease insights so we are simultaneously working on a paper onschizophrenia right now
 that is basically using the single cell profiling technologies using thisediting and manipulation technologies
 to basically show how the master regulators underlying changes inthe brain
 that are sort of found in in schizophrenia are in factaffecting excitatory neurons and
 inhibitory neurons in pathways that are active both in synaptic pruningbut also in early development we've
 basically found a set of four regulators that are connecting these two processesthat were previously separate
 in schizophrenia in sort of having a sort of more unified view across thosetwo
 those two sides the second one is in the in thearea of metabolism we basically now have
 a beautiful collaboration with the goodyear lab that's basically looking atum multi-tissue perturbations
 in six or seven different tissues across the bodyin the context of exercise and in the
 context of nutritional interventions using both mouse and humanwhere we can basically see what are the
 cell to cell communications that are that are changing across themand what we're finding is this
 immense role of both immune cells as well asadipocyte stem cells in sort of
 reshaping that circuitry of all of these different tissuesand that sort of painting to a new path
 for therapeutical interventions there in alzheimer's it's this huge focus onmicroglia
 and now we're discovering different classes of microglial cellsthat are basically either synaptic or
 um immune and these are playing vastly different roles inalzheimer's versus in schizophrenia
 and what we're finding is this immense complexityas you go further and further down of
 how in fact there's 10 different types of microglia each withtheir own sort of expression programs we
 used to think of them as oh yeah they're microgliabut in fact now we're realizing just
 even in that sort of least abundant of cell types there'sthis incredible diversity there
 the differences between brain regions is is anothersort of major major insight again you
 know one would think that oh astrocytes are astrocytes no matterwhere they are but no
 there's incredible region-specific differencesin the expression patterns of all of the
 major brain cell types across different brain regions sobasically there's the neocortical
 regions that are sort of the recent innovationthat makes us so different from all
 other species there's the sort of you know reptilian brain sort of regionsthat are sort of much more
 uh you know very extremely distinct there's a cerebellumthere's um each of those basically is
 associated in a different way with disease and what we're doing now islooking into
 pseudotemporal models for how disease progressesacross different regions of the brain if
 you look at alzheimer's it basically starts in thissmall region called the enter rhino
 cortex and then it spreads through the brain and uh you knowthrough the hippocampus and
 you know the uh ultimately affecting the neocortex and with every brain regionthat it hits
 it basically has a different impact on thecognitive and you know memory aspects
 orientation short-term memory long-term memory etcwhich is
 you know dramatically affecting the cognitive path that the individuals gothrough
 so what we're doing now is creating these computational models for orderingthe cells and the regions and the
 individuals according to their ability to predictalzheimer's disease
 so we can have a cell level predictor of pathology that allows us to nowcreate
 a temporal time course that tells us when every gene turns on along thispathology progression and then trace
 that across regions and pathological measures thatare region-specific
 but also cognitive measures and so so forth sothat allows us to now sort of for the
 first time look at can we actually do early intervention for alzheimer'swhere we know that the disease starts
 manifesting for 10 years before you actually have your first cognitiveloss
 can we start seeing that path to build new diagnostics new prognosis newbiomarkers
 for this sort of early intervention in alzheimer'sthe other aspect that we're looking at
 is mosaicism we talked about the common variants and the rare variantsbut in addition to those rare variants
 as your initial cell uh that that forms thezygote divides and divides and divides
 with every cell division there are additional mutations that are happeningso what you end up with is your brain
 being a mosaic of multiple different types of geneticunderpinnings some cells
 contain imitation that other cells don't haveso every human has the
 common variant that all of us carry to some degreethe rare variant that your immediate
 tree of the human species carries and thenthere's the somatic variant which is the
 tree that happened after the zygote that sortof forms your own body
 so these somatic alterations is something that has been previouslyinaccessible
 to study in human postmortem samples but right now with the advent of singlecell rna sequencing
 in this particular case we're using the well-based sequencing which is much moreexpensive but gives you a lot richer
 information about each of those transcripts so we'reusing now that richer information
 to infer mutations that have happened in each of the thousands of genes thatsort of are active
 in these cells and then understand how the genome relatesto the function this genotype
 phenotype relationship that we usually build in geos betweengenomic association studies between
 genetic variation and disease we're now building that at the celllevel where for every cell we can relate
 the unique specific genome of that cell with the expression patterns of thatcell
 and the predicted function using these predictive models that i mentionedbefore on this regulation for cognition
 for pathology in alzheimer's at the cell level andwhat we're finding is that
 the genes that are altered and the genetic regions that are alteredin common variants versus rare variant
 versus somatic variant are actually very different from eachother the somatic variants are pointing
 to neuronal energetics and oligodendrocytefunctions
 that are not visible in the genetic lesions that you find for the commonvariants
 probably because they have too strong of an effect that evolution is just nottolerating them
 on the common side of the allele frequency spectrum so the somatic one

Speaker 1 :that's the variation that happens after
 the the zygo after correct you individual i mean it's adumb question but
 there's there's mutation and variation i guess that happens thereand you're saying that they're through
 this if we focus in on individual cells we're able to detect astory that's interesting there
 and that might be a very unique kind of important variability that arises foryou said neuronal or something


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :energetic energetics energetic cool


Speaker 0 :terms so your your
 i mean the metabolism of humans is dramatically altered from that ofnearby species you know we talked about
 that last time that basically we are able to consume meatthat is incredibly energy rich and that
 allows us to sort of have functions that are you know meeting this humongousbrain that we have
 it's basically on one hand every one of our brain cells is much more energyefficient than our neighbors
 than our relatives number two we have way more of these cellsand number three we have you know
 this new diet that allows us to now feed all these needsthat basically creates a massive amount
 of damage oxidative damage from this huge superpowered factory of ideas and thoughts
 that we that we carry in our skull and that factory has energetic needsand there's a lot of sort of biological
 processes underlying that that we are finding are altered in thecontext of alzheimer's disease


Speaker 1 :that's fascinating that so you have to
 consider all of these systems if you want to understand even somethinglike diseases that you would
 maybe traditionally associate with just the particular cells of the brain

Speaker 0 :yeah the immune system


Speaker 1 :the metabolic system the metabolic
 system and these are all the things that

Speaker 0 :makes us uniquely human so our immune
 system is dramatically different from that ofour neighbors our societies are
 so much more clustered the history of infections that have plaguedthe human population is you know
 dramatically different from every other speciesthe the you know the way that our
 society in our population has sort of explodedhas basically put unique pressures on
 our immune system and our immune system has both coped with that density andalso been shaped by
 as i mentioned the you know vast amount of death that has happened in the blackplague and other sort of selective
 events in human history famines ice ages and soforth
 so that's number one then on on the sort of immune side on the metabolic sideyou know again we are able to sort of
 run marathons you know you know i don't know if youremember the sort of human versus horse
 experiment where the horse actually tires outfaster than the human and the human
 actually wins so so on the metabolic side we'redramatically different on the immune
 side we're dramatically different on the brain sideagain you know no need to sort of you
 know it's a no-brainer how our brain is like just enormously morecapable
 and then uh in you know in the side of cancer so basically the cancers thathumans
 are having the exposure the environmental exposures is againdramatically different
 and the lifespan the expansion of human lifespanis unseen in any other species in
 you know recent evolutionary history and that now leads to a lot of newdisorders
 that are starting to you know manifest late in life so uh you know alzheimer'sis one example where basically
 you know these vast energetic needs over a lifetimeof thinking can basically lead to all of
 these debris and eventually saturate the system andlead to
 you know alzheimer's in in the late life but there's you know there's just such asuch a dramatic
 uh set of frontiers when it comes to aging researchthat you know will so what i often like
 to say is that if you want to re to to engineer a carto go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles
 an hour that's fine you can basically you know fix a fewcomponents if you wanted to now go out
 400 miles an hour you have to completely redesign theentire car
 because the system has just not evolved to go that far basically our human bodyhas only evolved to live to i don't know
 120 maybe we can get to 150 with minorchanges
 but if you know as we start pushing these frontiers for not justliving but well living the f
 zine that we talked about last time so to to basically push f zineinto the 80s and 90s and 100s and you
 know much further than that we will face new challengesthat have you know never been faced
 before in terms of cancer the number of divisions in terms of alzheimer's andbrain related disorders
 in terms of metabolic disorders in terms of regenerationthere's just so many different frontiers
 ahead of us so i am thrilled about where we're headingso basically i see this confluence
 in my lab and many other labs of ai of you know sort of you know the nextfrontier of ai for drug design so
 basically these sort of graph neural networks on specificchemical
 uh designs that allow you to create new generations of therapeuticsthese
 molecular biology tricks for intervening at the system at every levelthis personalized medicine prediction
 diagnosis and prognosis using the electronic health recordsand using these polygenic risk scores
 weighted by the burden the number of mutationsthat are accumulating across common rare
 and somatic variants the burden converging across all ofthese different
 molecular pathways the delivery of specific drugs and specificinterventions into specific cell types
 and again you've talked with bob langer about this there's you know many giantsin that field
 and then the last concept is not intervening at the single gene leveli want you to sort of conceptualize the
 concept of an on target side effectwhat is an on target side effect an
 off-target side effect is when you design a molecule to targetone gene and instead it targets another
 gene and you have side effects because of thatan on target side effect is when your
 molecule does exactly what you're expectingbut that gene is pliotropic plio means
 many tropos means ways many ways it acts inmany ways
 it's a multifunctional gene so you find that this gene plays a role in this butas we talked about
 the wiring of genes to phenotypes is extremely dense and extremely complexso the next stage of intervention will
 be intervening not at the gene level but atthe network level
 intervening at the set of pathways and the set of genes withmulti-input perturbations to the system
 multi-input modulations pharmaceutical or other interventionalthat basically allow you to now work at
 the sort of full level of understanding notjust in your brain but across your body
 not just in one gene but across the set of pathways and so forthfor every one of these disorders so i
 think that we're finally at the level of systems medicine of basically instead ofsort of medicine being at the single
 gene level medicine being at the systems level where it can be personalizedbased on a specific set of genetic
 markers and genetic perturbations that you areeither born with or that you have
 developed during your lifetime your unique set of exposuresyour unique set of biomarkers and you
 know your unique set of you know current set ofconditions through your
 ehr and other ways and the precision componentof intervening extremely precisely in
 the specific pathways and specific combinations of genes thatshould be modulated to sort of bring you
 from the disease state to the physiologically normal state oreven to a physiologically improved state
 through this combination of intervention so that that's in my view the fieldwhere basically computer science comes
 together with you know artificial intelligencestatistics all of these other tools
 molecular biology technologies and biotechnology and pharmaceuticaltechnologies that are sort of
 in revolutionary the way of intervention and of course this massive amount ofmolecular biology and data gathering and
 generation perturbation in massively parallel ways so there's nobetter way there's no better
 you know time there's no better place to be sort of you know looking at thiswhole confluence
 of of ideas and i'm just so thrilled to bea small part of this amazing enormous
 ecosystem

Speaker 1 :it's exciting to imagine what the humans
 of 100 200 years from now what their life experience is likebecause
 these ideas seem to have potential to transform the quality of lifethat when they look back at us
 they probably wonder how we were put up with all the sufferingin the world manoa it's a huge honor
