 undereducated about from the internet trolls to alex jonesto white nationalists and to techno
 anarchists the book is funny and brilliant and sois michael

Speaker 1 :from ukraine
 okay wow no because you came here a little bit when you were youngeryeah i i i came here when i was 13 so i
 saturated a little bit of the russian souli i marinated in there so a little


Speaker 0 :deeper i haven't told anyone this but
 i'll be glad to tell you davidish um i haven't been back sincei was two and next summer it looks like
 me my buddy chris williamson who's also a podcaster he's british modern wisdomhe looks like apollo

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :videographer which apollo the god


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :so we're going to go for the first time
 to see where i came from

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :which is ukraine we're going to go to
 level and either st petersburg or moscow probably st petersburg or bothit's going to be intense it's going to
 be a lot of panic attacks i feel

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and your russian is okay


Speaker 0 :no you can't talk russian ukraine or
 it's like they get offended yeah but

Speaker 1 :then you also want to go to russia
 yeah i don't know for me there's several people in russiai want an interview on a podcast
 okay so one one of them is uh guerrilla promon which is a mathematicianand the other person is putin you know


Speaker 0 :my favorite food and story is
 do you know this no when he had merkel with him do you know this story nomerkel's scared of dogs like petrified
 of dogs so he brings in his like like like uh black lab it's a labradorit's like the sweetest animal
 and it's all over her and there's pictures and she's sitting like this andshe's terrified and he's like what's
 wrong angela it's just completely trolling her yeah

Speaker 1 :he's aware of the sort of uh the
 narrative around him yeah and then he plays with it yes he

Speaker 0 :enjoys it it's a very russian thing
 my friend wanted to film about me he goes i realize you guys aren't like usat all you just like like
 look at us and then i started telling him stories about the upbringingand he's like oh my god and as i'm
 telling them like wow this stuff is really crazy like what

Speaker 1 :how we are wired who's the we your


Speaker 0 :friend is the russian the friends
 american i'm saying the way russians are brought upand the way maybe i don't think it was
 just my family i bet you had similar things likehere's an example i i was i had a buddy
 staying with me he had a problem with his roommate so he crashed in my placefine
 i went to the gym and i come back and he goes oh there was and myapartment buildings has four four
 apartments so it's not like a huge thing he goes oh there was someone knocking atyour door
 so you know i i told him blah blah and andfor me and i wonder if you're the same
 way if i'm at someone's house that's not myown and someone knocks on the door
 i wouldn't even think to answer it like if i had an apple here might be i'd eatit i'd
 cut it whatever i'm not gonna it just doesn't enter my head to smash into myface
 the the thought of answering the door if it's not my houseit would never enter my head would it
 enter your head no but why but he's an american so someone's at the door hegoes and opens it even though it's not
 his house i would never do that i would neverthink to do that


Speaker 1 :that is so strange you pick some very
 obscure thing to

Speaker 0 :delineate americans i don't think that's
 obscure because i think it speaks to how we perceive strangerswith americans everyone's friendly and
 with us it's like no no like you have that moat and i thinkthat's a that
 percolates into many different aspects of how we relate to people and i had to

Speaker 1 :undo a lot of that that's true
 you're right there's uh the relationship i formed there were in russiaor very deep yeah close and then there's
 the strangers the other that you don't trust by default it takesa long time to go over the moat


Speaker 0 :of trust for a long time until recently
 whenever i said anything to anyone my brainran a scan that said if this person
 turns on you would this can they use this against youand i would do everything i said with
 strangers and after a while it's like you knowwhat maybe they will but i'm strong
 enough to take it but this is not how americans think wellhere's another one let me ask you this
 sorry i'm taking over the interview people asked about likeadvice for work right like i had this
 there was this party i went to and basically everyone had their ownproblems and everyone else gave their
 advice right and someone was having a problem withthe co-worker and the advice these
 dupoy americans gave them is oh sit down and have a talk with themand to me this is like the last case
 last resort like first you have to see whatyou can without showing your hand
 sharing your vulnerability only when everything hasn't worked out or you'relike all right let me sit down with you
 and try to have it out with you probably but for them the first thing is like sitdown and be like oh you're causing me
 problems and blah blah so i perceive that right away as athreat that this person sees an
 antagonism between us and also as a weakness that i'm getting to themso my reaction isn't um how do i make it
 better my reaction is to reinforce my position and see what i can tomarginalize
 them usually i haven't worked in a corporate setting in a long timebut it's not i don't approach it the way
 an american would like i'm glad you came and talked to me now i probably wouldbecause it's gonna be a friend


Speaker 1 :so you attribute that to the russian
 upbringing as opposed to you have deep uh psychological issues i think those

Speaker 0 :are synonymous
 wait am i would you think differently maybe a few years ago

Speaker 1 :um i don't know i i i think you lost me
 at the because you kind of said that you'rekind of implying you have a deep
 distrust of the world

Speaker 0 :like the world does i think the default


Speaker 1 :setting would be distrust yeah
 but i would put it differently is i almostignore the rest of the i don't even
 acknowledge it i just uh savor i save my love and trust for the small

Speaker 0 :circle of people
 i agree but when that person is being confrontational or as they perceive itas being open
 now there's a situation how do you how

Speaker 1 :would you handle that
 like like a cold wind blows he's just

Speaker 0 :kind of like yeah but it's not like
 this is an opportunity for us to work out our differences it's a cold windit's not a hug that's my point
 you're so suspicious what it really is is a cold windi'm so inhumane to be scared of it's a
 cold wind person but it's not this is great

Speaker 1 :but it's not a source of like i'm not
 suspicious of like i'm not uh anxious i would say orlike living in fear of the rest of the
 world

Speaker 0 :anymore oh i agree but you're not
 receptive to that person right that's all i'm saying and they are got

Speaker 1 :it so speaking of which
 let's talk about love yes which requires to bereceptive of the world yes of strangers
 i agreed how do we put more love out there in theworld
 especially on the internet one mechanism

Speaker 0 :i have found to
 um increase love and that's a word that has many meanings and isyou know used in a very intense sense
 and it's used in a very loose sense

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :can you try to define love sure love is
 a strong sense of attraction toward a another person entityor place that causes one
 to tend to react in a disproportionately positive manner that's off the top of myhead disproportionately
 yes so for example if why not proportionallybecause like if you're someone's about
 to who you love is about to get harmed you're movingheaven and earth
 to make sure uh or like a book you love you know like i love this book likeyou're going through the fire to try to
 save it whereas if it's a book you really likeit's like huh i'll get another one
 i don't you know and a book's a kind of a loose example but

Speaker 1 :so you're going with the love that's
 like you're saving for just a few people almost like romantically like love for aclose family but it's also
 just love to even the broader like the kind oflove you can put out to people on the
 internet which is like just kindness

Speaker 0 :sure i would say in that case it's
 important to make them feel seen and validatedand i try to do this when people who i
 have come to know on the internet and there's a loti try to do that as much as possible
 because i don't think it's valid how on social media andi do this a lot myself but not towards
 everyone it's just there to be aggressive andantagonistic
 you should be antagonistic towards bad people and that's finebut at the same time there's lots of
 great people and especially with my audience and i wouldbet disproportionately with yours
 there's a lot of people who are because of their psychology and intelligenceare going to be much more isolated
 socially than they should and if i and i've heard from many ofthem and if i'm the person who makes
 them feel oh i'm not crazy it's everyone else aroundme who is just basic
 uh the fact that i can be that person which i didn't have at their ageto me is incredibly reaffirming you mean


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :a source of love but i mean love in the
 sense of like you know you care about this person andyou want good things for them not in a
 kind of romantic way but i mean you're using ina broad sense now yeah but you're also a


Speaker 1 :person who kind of
 i mean uh attacks this power structures in the world bymocking them
 yes effectively yes and uh love i would say requires you to benon-witty and simple and fragile
 which i see it as like the opposite of what trolls do

Speaker 0 :trolls are if i if there is
 someone coming after what i love there's two mechanisms right at leasttwo
 i go up and i'm fighting them and in which caseyou bring in if you are getting hurt and
 i fight even if you win the knife fight or if you disarm them and you precludethe possibility of a fight
 and you drive them off or render them powerless youcan you keep your person intact as
 yourself

Speaker 1 :and you also protect your values so how
 do you render them powerless

Speaker 0 :as you just said by mocking them one of
 the most effective mechanisms for those in powerwe're much closer to brave new world
 than 1984. the people who are dominant and in power aren't there because of thethreat of
 you know the gulag or prison they're there because of social pressures lookat the masks i was on the subway not
 that long ago in new york city um no one cared who i was until i putout the mask i was in the subway that
 long in new york city there was and i put this on my instagram i've told thisstory before
 there was an asian dude in his early 30s he was like in western clothes it's notlike he had a
 rickshaw or something an older man in his 50sstood up over him on the subway screamed
 at him said go back where you came from you'redisgusting i'm going to get sick
 if you think this guy is a vector of disease which is your prerogative whyare you coming close to him why are you
 getting in his face

Speaker 1 :and what that was sorry so it was
 because

Speaker 0 :he was asian it was both it was
 the not having a mask gave him the permissionto act like a despicable aggressive
 person toward him right and the point being a lot of thesemechanisms for social control are
 outsourced to low-quality people because this istheir one chance to assert dominance and
 status over somebody else so the best way to defuse that isn'twith weaponry or fighting
 it's through mockery because all of a sudden their claims to authority areeffectively destroyed


Speaker 1 :so let me push back on that what about
 fighting that with with love with umpatience and like kindness towards them


Speaker 0 :i i don't think kindness
 is i think that would be uh a mismatch and inappropriatethere's superman is batman okay and
 superman's job is to help the good people and batman's job is to hurt thebad people
 and i will always be on the batman side than the superman side

Speaker 1 :both work the silly tight costumes one
 has pointy ears both are ridiculous so it's

Speaker 0 :uh it was a billionaire who gets
 you know he's swimming in trim which one

Speaker 1 :is the best batman
 okay i'm uh i'm undereducated on um okay on the superhero movies i apologizeokay but
 but you're just saying you your predisposition is to be on the batmanside is to uh fighting
 the bad guys yeah and that's what i'm good atthat's what you're good at but just to
 play devil's advocate or actually in this case i am the devil because that'swhat i usually


Speaker 0 :do watch the devil here the other angels
 advocate exactly

Speaker 1 :to be the to be the angel advocate yeah
 it's like i feel like mockery isum is a as a path towards escalation of
 conflict

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yes in many ways yes so you're not
 i mean it's kind of like guerrilla warfareit means you're not going to win i am


Speaker 0 :winning we're all winning
 we're winning on a daily this is my next book we're winning we've won before i'mnot joking


Speaker 1 :the net the topic of the next book yes
 is the white pill

Speaker 0 :the white pill is that we're gonna we
 are winning the most horrible people are beingrendered into laughing stocks on a daily


Speaker 1 :basis social media this is glorious
 i so disagree with you i disagree with you because there's side effects thatare
 very destructive it feels like you're winning butwe're completely destroying the
 possibility of having um like a cohesive society that's

Speaker 0 :called oncology


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :what's that mean curing cancer no your
 concept of a cohesive society is in fact a society based on oppressionand not allowing individuals to live
 their personal freedom

Speaker 1 :oh so your your utopian view of this


Speaker 0 :you're the utopian you're saying
 cohesive society i'm saying i don't need that i'm sayingthere's going to be conflict right
 there's going to be conflict you and i are disagreeing right nowthat's not cohesive doesn't mean we like
 each other less doesn't mean we respect each other lesscohesive doesn't it it's just a
 euphemism for like everyone's submitting

Speaker 1 :to what i want
 no i mean cohesive could could uh could be that it could beum it could be like enforced with
 violence all that kind of stuff sort of the uh the libertarian view of the worldbut it could just be
 being respectful and kind of each other and kind towards each other and lovingtowards each other
 i mean that's what i mean by cohesive so when people say freeit's it's funny like freedom is a funny
 thing because freedom can be painful to a lot ofpeople
 it's it's all matters how you define it how you implement it how it actuallylooks like
 sure and i'm just saying it feels like the mockery of the powerfulleads to further and further the
 divisions it's like it's turning life into a gameto where it's always you're playing
 you you're creating these different little tribes and groupsand you're constantly
 uh fighting the groups that become a little bit more powerfulby undercutting them through guerrilla
 warfare kind of thing and that's what the internet becomes iseveryone's just mocking each other
 and then certain groups become more and more powerful and thenthey start fighting each other and into
 basic they they form groups of ideologies and they startfighting each other in the internet
 where the result is it doesn't feel like the common humanity is highlighted itdoesn't feel like
 that's a path of progress now like when i say cohesive i don'tmean like
 everybody has to be you know enforcing equality all those kinds of ideasi just mean like not being so divisive
 that's like so it's going back to the original question of likehow do we put more love out in the world
 than the internet i i want divisiveness oh you see you think thatthis is that's that goal it's very


Speaker 0 :interesting it's the goal
 so you we started this conversation with you talking about you have love for thatsmall group
 uh i think we both would agree to have a bigger group be better especially ifthat love comes from a sincere place
 um i think our country specific i wrote an article about this four years agothat it's time to
 disunite the states and to secede this country has been held together with atleast two separate cultures
 with thumbtacks and string for over 20 years uh there's an enormous amount ofcontempt
 from one group toward another this contempt comes from sincere placethey do not share each other's values
 there's absolutely no reason just like any unhealthy relationshipwhere you can't say you know what it's
 not working out i want to go my own way and live myhappiness
 and i genuinely want you to go your way live your happiness if i'm wrong proveme wrong
 i'll learn from you and and take lessons and vice versabut the fact that we all have to be in
 the same house together is not coherent and that's not love that is the pathtowards friction and tension especially


Speaker 1 :do you think there's
 concrete groups like is it as simple as the two groups of blue and red

Speaker 0 :no it's it's it's it's also very fluid
 because you and i are allied as jewish people as russiansas males
 as podcasters uh you're an academic i'm not there so there'sthere we're different but we each are a
 venn diagram even within ourselves and i can talk toyou about politics and then we can talk
 about russia stuff and then you could talk aboutyour your work which i don't know
 anything about so that would be where you're way up here in our way down hereso there's lots every relationship with
 just between individuals there's it's very dynamic so how do we

Speaker 1 :succeed like how do we form individual
 states sure there's a little bit more cohesionsure


Speaker 0 :the and voluntary cohesion so the first
 step is to uh um eliminate and the concept ofpolitical authority as legitimate
 and to uh denigrate and humiliate those who would put themselves in a positionin which they are
 there to tell you how to live your life from any semblance ofvalidity and that's starting to happen
 um if you look at what they had with the lockdowns cuomo and de blasio new yorkuh we have i was uh tired a couple weeks
 ago and i said to my friend oh just clickmaybe i've covered and he goes it's not
 possible like what do you mean and he goes we haven't had any deaths inlike two months
 and there's only 100 cases a day for like two months and i goyou're exaggerating because everything
 was still closed and i looked at the numbers and he wasn't exaggeratingand there's no greater american dream to
 me than an immigrant family comes to thestates forms their own little business
 maybe mom's a good cook it's a restaurant dry cleaner fruit standand those people aren't going to have a
 lot of money those are the first ones who lost theircompanies because of these lockdowns
 they cuomo who's the governor of new york opened up the gyms he said you'reclear to open up
 de blasio said and we don't have enough inspectors you're gonna have to waitanother couple of weeks
 uh to regard that as anything other than literally criminalis something that i am having a hard and
 harder time wrapping my head around you said i mean

Speaker 1 :that's something i'm deeply worried
 about as well which is like thousands it's actually millionsof dreams being crushed that amer
 american dream of starting a business of running a business

Speaker 0 :what about all the young people who you
 and i have in our audiences who are socially isolated at best andnow they can't leave their homes
 uh isolation and ostracism are things that are very well studied in psychologythese have extreme consequences i read a
 book called ostracism and this wasn't scientific but basicallythe author was a psychiatrist at college
 whatever and he had one of his colleagues theydid an experiment let's for a week
 you ostracized me completely we know it's an and he goeseven knowing it's the experiment the
 fact that he wouldn't make eye contact with me and the fact that he ignored mehad an extreme emotional impact on me
 knowing full well this is purely for experimental purposes now you multiplythat by all these p
 the suicide the number of kids were thinking about suicide was through theroof
 during all this uh and my point is until these peopleit's gonna i would predict like 2024
 that's where we're going to have to start having conversations about whatpersonal consequences have to be done
 for these people because until then they're going to do the same thing

Speaker 1 :so you think there's going to be
 society-wide consequences of this that we're going to see like ripple effectsbecause of the social isolation i i know


Speaker 0 :i mean we also need to talk about
 consequences or cuomo de blasio because if politicians respond toincentives and the incentives are there
 for them to be extremely conservative because if you have to choose as cuomosaid a press conference between
 a thousand people dying and a thousand people losing their business it's not ahard choice and he's right
 but at a certain point it's like all right you're losingboth you're losing not losing the you're
 making these decisions um and not having consequences for itand you're going to do it again the next
 time so we need to make sure you're you're alittle scared okay and i don't know what
 that would mean

Speaker 1 :but you're laying this
 problem this this incompetence i don't

Speaker 0 :think it's incompetence i think it's
 very competent i think they're just they're jobs yes

Speaker 1 :but
 what but you're laying it not at the the hands of the individuals but thestructure of the


Speaker 0 :of government it's both yes


Speaker 1 :how would we deal with it better without
 centralized control

Speaker 0 :well we didn't really have centralized
 control because every country and every state you know handled it in a different

Speaker 1 :mechanism but a city has centralized
 control just yeah

Speaker 0 :right i mean no that's not true so cuomo
 de blasio they had a lot of disagreements over thisover the months and this was actually a
 source of great interest and tension um de blasio wanted at one point wastalking about like quarantining people
 in their homes home was like you're crazy uh somethingsame thing with the schools same thing
 with the gyms um and there are other such uh examplesbut the point being this was an
 emergency this is world war one i talked about some timpool show um wasvery dangerous
 because it gave a lot of evil people some very useful information about whatthe country put up with
 and what they can get away with under wartime and this set the model forthings like the new deal and the other
 things of that nature it is undeniable you're a scientist soyou understand this perfectly well
 um that this lockdown gave some very nefarious peoplesome very valid data about how much
 people will put up with uh under uh pressures from the state

Speaker 1 :so fundamentally what is the problem


Speaker 0 :with the state that's existence


Speaker 1 :okay well but but uh uh to play angel's
 advocate again you know government is the people

Speaker 0 :so come on you don't you you you're do
 you do you really think this

Speaker 1 :at as best i think it's possible to have
 represent representation

Speaker 0 :can you imagine if you have an attorney
 you're like oh you can't have the attorney you want you're gonna have thisguy who you absolutely hate who you
 share no values with why

Speaker 1 :because he drives i mean leaders
 political leaders and political representation drive thediscourse like we you know
 uh the majority of people voted for him or whateverhowever however he defined that and
 now we get to have a discussion well was this the right choice and then weget to make that choice again in four
 years and so on

Speaker 0 :first of all the fact that i have to be
 under the thumb of somebody four years makes no sense there's no otherrelationship that's like this including
 a marriage you can leave any other relationship atany time number one


Speaker 1 :number two is it always impeach but they
 did that part of it i'm in just saying yeah that there's yeahthe mechanisms
 are uh flawed in many ways yeah yeah

Speaker 0 :right and and
 so that's number one number two is it doesn't make sensethat if i don't want someone to
 represent me that because that person is popular thatthey are now in a position to so having
 uh um representation and and havingcitizenship based on
 geography is a pre line technology in a post-cell phone world there's noreason why
 i have to just because we're physically in between two oceanswe all have to be represented by the
 same people whereas i can very easily havemy security be under someone and switch
 it as easily as cell phone

Speaker 1 :providers so okay but it doesn't have to
 be geographical it can be ideas sure i mean this country represents acertain set of ideas yes it does it
 started out geographically

Speaker 0 :it still it was just it started off as


Speaker 1 :ideas as well but like there's a it's
 it was intricately i mean that's the way humans are there'si mean there was no internet so
 it was you were geographically in the same location and you signed a bunch ofdocuments and then you kind of debated
 and you wrote a bunch of stuff and then youagreed on it


Speaker 0 :okay so you understand that no one
 signed these documents and no one agreed to itas lysandra spooner pointed out over 150
 years ago the constitution or the social contractif anything
 is only binding to the signatories and even then they're all long deaduh so it's it's this fallacy that
 somehow because i'm in a physical place i have agreed even though i'm screamingto you a face that i don't agree
 to be um subordinate to uh some imaginary invisible monster that wascreated 250 years ago
 and this idea of like if you don't like it you have to move that's not whatfreedom means
 freedom means i do what i want not what you want so if you don't like it

Speaker 1 :you move okay just to put some i don't
 like words

Speaker 0 :and terms one one one zero one one one
 zero yeah exactly is that what your language is it is

Speaker 1 :i'm translating it all in real time but
 uh would you call the kind of ideas thatuh you're advocating for and we're


Speaker 0 :talking about anarchy yes anarchism yes


Speaker 1 :okay so let's get into it can you can
 you try to paint the utopia thatan anarchist worldview dreams about


Speaker 0 :the only people who describe anarchism
 as utopia are its critics if i told you right now and i wish icould say this factually that i have a
 cure for cancer that would not make us a utopia thatwould still probably be expensive
 we would still have many other diseases however we would be fundamentallyhealthier happier and better off all


Speaker 1 :of us than democracy so that democracy
 sorry i jump back from the cancer no

Speaker 0 :that democracy or
 government so it's only curing one major major life-threatening problem but in nosense


Speaker 1 :is it a utopia so what can we try to uh
 answer this question same question many times which iswhat exactly is the problem with


Speaker 0 :democracy the problem with democracy is
 that those who need leaders are not

Speaker 1 :qualified to choose them
 those who need leaders are not qualified to choose them so that's the central

Speaker 0 :problem of democracy not all of us need


Speaker 1 :leaders
 right what does it mean to need a leader areyou saying like people who are
 actually like free thinkers don't need leaders kind of thing

Speaker 0 :sure that's but like take a wave but


Speaker 1 :like you don't
 okay so do you acknowledge that there's somevalue in authority
 in different subjects so what what that means is i don't mean an authoritysomebody who's in control of you


Speaker 0 :but you're doing the definition switch


Speaker 1 :because i am i am you're right you're
 right it's unfair okay those those bad

Speaker 0 :but that's what they do that's their
 trick yeah and it's this is one of the useful things by the way less is totalsidebar
 if people ask me for advice i always tell them if you're going to raise yourkids raise them bilingual
 because i was trilingual by the time i was six and that teaches you to think inconcepts
 whereas if you only know one language you fall for things like this becauseusing authority in the sense of a
 policeman and someone is an authority in physicsit's the same word conceptually they're
 extremely different but if you're only thinking in onelanguage your brain is going to equate
 the two and that's a trap that people who only speak one language have

Speaker 1 :for sure but even if you know multiple
 languages you can still use the trick of using your c or convenienceyeah absolutely to manipulate the
 conversation you weren't trying to do

Speaker 0 :that but you


Speaker 1 :you fell in i accidentally did it yeah


Speaker 0 :right we all tend to do that if you only
 speak one language and think of one language

Speaker 1 :but if i guess let me rephrase it i
 are you against do you acknowledge the valueof like offloading your own
 effort about a particular thing to somebody else

Speaker 0 :absolutely like an accountant a lawyer a
 doctor absolute a chef infinite isn't that

Speaker 1 :ultimately what
 a democracy is broadly defined like you're basically electing a bunch of

Speaker 0 :authorities using the word you in two
 senses using the word you meaning me as anindividual now using you as a mass


Speaker 1 :yes as a math not use an individual so i


Speaker 0 :have i would absolutely want someone to
 provide for my security i would absolutely want someone to negotiatewith me for foreign power or something
 like that that does not mean it has to bepredicated and what lots of other people
 who i do not know and if i do know them probably would not respectthink about it's of no moral relevance
 to me

Speaker 1 :nor eye to them so do you think this
 kind of there could be a bunch of humans that behave kind oflike
 ants in a distributed way there could be an emergent behavior in them thatresults in a stable society like
 isn't that the hope with anarchy is like without

Speaker 0 :an overarching uh but answer
 i i mean answer the worst example here because ants have a very firm authority

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :the queen yeah and they're all they're
 all drones they're all clones of each other

Speaker 1 :yeah but so if you forget the queen
 their behavior they're all well from your perspective from yourhuman intelligence perspective but from
 their perspective they'll probably see each other as a bunch of individuals no

Speaker 0 :they don't
 ants are very big on altruism in the sense of self-sacrificethey do not think the individual matters
 they routinely kill themselves for the sake of the hivein the community but they


Speaker 1 :see that's from the outside perspective
 from the individual perspective of the individual they probablythey they don't see it as altruism


Speaker 0 :right but they they view and they're
 right because the aunt's life is very ephemeraland cheap that it's more important to
 continue this mass population that that one individualant live
 like bees are another even better example the honey bee when they stingthey only
 sting once and they die and they do it gladly because it's like okaythis community is much more important
 than me and they're right

Speaker 1 :yeah okay so fine let's forget i'm being


Speaker 0 :pedantic but it's important i think i'm
 not just being for the sake of being fed but

Speaker 1 :there's something beautiful that
 i won't argue about because i do there's an interesting point there aboutindividualism of
 ants i do think they're more individual but likelet's let's give your view of ants that
 they're it's their communists okay let's go with the communist view of antsokay yeah uh
 but there's still a beautiful emergent thing which is likethey can function as a as a society and
 without i would say centralized control

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :so is that the hope for anarchy it's
 like you just throw a bunch of people that voluntarily want to be in the sameplace
 under the same set of ideas and they kind of likethe doctors emerge the police officers
 emerge the uh the different necessarystructures of a functional society
 emerge

Speaker 0 :do you know what the most beautiful
 example of anarchism is that is just beyond beautiful when youstop to think about it
 i'm not being tongue-in-cheek language there's infinite languages language thethings that language can be used for
 are bring tears to people's eyes quite literallyit's also used for basic things no one
 is forcing us we speak two languages each at least noone's forcing us to use english
 no one's forcing us to use this dialect of english uhit's a way and and despite there being
 so many different languages uh lingua franca emerge you know peoplethe language that everyone is in latin
 even in north korea they refer to the fish and the different animals by thelatin
 scientific uh no one decided this sure there's an organizationthat sets a binomial nomenclature but
 there's no gun to anyone's head referring to uh seamoth as a pegasusspecies
 and when you think about how amazing language isand someone other context would say like
 well you you need to have a world governmentand they're deciding which is the verbs
 and you have to have an official definitionand an official dictionary and none of
 that happened and i think anyone even if they don'tagree with my politics or my worldview
 cannot deny that the creation of language isone of humanity's most miraculous
 beautiful achievements

Speaker 1 :absolutely so there there you go there's
 one system where a kind of anarchy can result inin beauty stability like sufficient
 stability and yet dynamic flexibility to adjust it and soon
 and the internet helps it you get some something like urban dictionary whichwhich starts creating absurd both humor
 and

Speaker 0 :wit but also language and syntax and
 jargon immediately you size people up if you use if you say vertebral i knowyou're a doctor because that's how they
 pronounce it the the spinal column uh i'm sure in your field there'scertain jargon right away you can know
 if this person's one of us or not i mean it's infinite i mean i don't needto tell you and it's emojis
 too yes there's so much there to study with language it's fascinating but

Speaker 1 :do you think this applies to human life
 the the meat space the physical space yes sothese there's that kind of beauty can
 emerge without uh without writing stuff on paperwithout laws you could have rules you


Speaker 0 :don't need
 you don't have to be laws so enforced by

Speaker 1 :violence
 like that's what what's a law a law is

Speaker 0 :something that is unchosen
 a rule is something if i go to my pool and i i sign up to remember a poolon the wall lists certain things it's
 like you know certain number of people in the poolno peeing in here good luck enforcing
 that one um and so on and so forth well

Speaker 1 :that's the problem
 aren't you afraid that people are gonna

Speaker 0 :pee in the pool that's not as
 my biggest concern is mass incarceration as the fact that the police can stealmore money than burglars can
 the fact that innocent people can be killed with no consequencesthe fact that war can be waged and with
 no uh consequences for those who waged itthe fact that so many
 men and women are being murdered overseas and here and the people who areguiding these are regarded as heroic


Speaker 1 :so you think there might that in an
 anarchist system there's a possibility of have of havingless wars and less what would you say
 corruption and uh less abuse of power let's talk

Speaker 0 :yes and let's talk about corruption
 because and i made this point on rogan you and iagain this the russian background we
 realize that when it comes to corruptionamerican is very naive
 corruption they think is oh i got my brother a job and he's getting money onthe table
 that's not when we're talking about like state corruptionthings that are done in totalitarian
 states and even to some extent in america like jeffrey epstein julianmaxwell
 things that stalin did things that hitler did you know when the cia wastorturing people at gitmo
 they had to borrow kgb manuals because they didn't know how to torturecorrectly because they never thought of
 these things we it's very hard for us to get into themindset of someone who's like a child
 predator someone who uh let me give you anexample from my forthcoming book there
 was a guy who was the head of ukraine in the 30s i forget his name now theseold soviets they were tough
 i mean they pride stalin means steel you know they pride themselves in theircruelty
 and how strong they were and this was the purge you know stalin is trying toyou know killing lots of people left and
 right and his henchman beria had the quoteuh find me the man i'll find you the
 crime you know they would accuse someone and they would torture himuntil he talked and confessed and then
 he had to turn people in and they took this guy in like beginningthe year i think it's 36 38 he was had
 ukraine by may he's arrested and they take himto the le blanca the basement in the red
 square where they're torturing people and they put they did the works on himand he was a good soviet he stood up
 and he who knows what they did to him he didn't talkso they said okay one moment they
 brought his teenage daughter in raped her in front of him he talked sowhen we talk about corruption we
 would never in a million years think of this that's not how our minds workum so when you're talking about states
 and people where you don't have ease of exitwhere you are forced to be under the
 auspices of an organization creating a monopoly that leads toin extreme cases but in not as extreme
 cases really uh nefarious outcomes whereasif you have the option to leave as a
 client or customer that would have a strongly limitingeffect
 on uh how a business and what it can get away with so

Speaker 1 :but don't you think maybe i don't know
 who the right example is whether it's stalini think hitler might be the better
 example of don't you think or jeffrey epsteinperhaps
 don't you think people who are evil will will find ways to manipulate humannature
 to attain power no matter the system yes and like the the corollary questionis
 do you think those people can get more powerin um in the democracy in a you know
 in when there's a government already in

Speaker 0 :place they can it's easily they get more
 power more dangerous they have a government placefirst of all sociopaths are known for
 their charm and for their warmth here's the two situationsin in a free society i'm a sociopath i'm
 an evil person i'm the head of macy's in a statesociety i'm an evil person i'm a
 sociopath i'm the head of the us governmentwhich of these are you more concerned
 with it's like night and day so you would have far more decentralizedmilitary you would have far more
 decentralized security forces and they would be muchmore subject to feedback from the market
 if you have an issue with macy's or any store with a sweaterlook at that transaction if you have an
 issue with the state to you hiring a lawyer costs more than asurgeon to even
 access the mechanism for dispute is going to be exorbitant and price poorpeople out of the market for um
 conflict resolution immediately so right away you have something that's extremelyregressive and even though this is
 touted as some great equalizer it's quite the opposite

Speaker 1 :so in current society there's a deep
 suspicion of governments and states

Speaker 0 :they're not that's not really like just


Speaker 1 :your example of macy's i mean
 don't you think a hitler could rise to be at the topof a social network like twitter and


Speaker 0 :facebook okay let's suppose hitler ran
 twitter okay let's take this thought experimentseriously
 literally what could he do so all the only tweets are gonna be about how muchthe jews suck
 right okay fine okay all the cool people are leaving

Speaker 1 :there could be some compelling like you
 said um evil people are charming there couldbe some compelling narratives that could
 be with conspiracy theories uh untruths that could be spreadlike propaganda every criticism of


Speaker 0 :anarchism
 is in fact a description well the strongest criticisms of anarchism are infact description of the status quo
 your concern is under anarchism propaganda would spread and people wouldbe taught the wrong ideas unlike the
 status quo

Speaker 1 :that's not even a criticism of anarchism
 i'm not actually criticizing it's an open question ofit's an open question of in which system
 will human nature thrive bebe able to thrive more and in in which
 system would the evils that arise in human nature would be moreeasily suppressable
 there that's that's the question it's a scientific experiment and i'm askingonly from our perspective
 of the fact that we've tried democracy quite a bit recently and we i don'tmaybe you can correct me we haven't yet
 seriously tried anarchy in a large scale

Speaker 0 :well we don't need to try to
 so anarchy isn't like a country right it's like it's you can'ti'm not it's like saying well if anarchy
 works how can we've never had an anarchist government rightso anarchism is a relationship and
 language is an example of this it's a worldwideand our system you and i have an
 anarchist relationship there's almost no circumstances we'd be calling the police

Speaker 1 :on each other i mean it's i'm asking the
 same question in a bunch of different directions out ofborn out of my curiosity
 is why is anarchy going to be better at preventing the darker sides ofhuman nature which
 presumably your criticism of government

Speaker 0 :because it's this because of
 decentralization so the darker side of human nature is anextreme concern
 anyone who says it's going to go away is absurdand fallacious i think that's a
 non-starter when people say that everyone's going to be good human beingsare basically animals we're capable of
 great beauty and kindness we're capable ofjust complete
 cruel and what we would call inhumanity but we see it on a daily basis eventoday
 uh and what's interesting is the corporate presswon't even tell you the darkest aspects
 because that's too upsetting to people so they'll tell you about atrocities andhorrors but only to a point
 um and then when you actually do the homework you're like oh it's so muchworse than
 like that thing about stalin right so we know in a broadsense that stalin was a dictator we know
 that he killed a lot of people but it takes workto learn about the hall of demore it
 takes work to learn about what those literal tortures were and that this isthe person who later
 fdr and harry truman were shaking hands with and taking photos with andwas being sold to us as uncle joe you
 know he's just like you and me um so when you have a decentralizedinformation network as opposed to having
 three media networks it is a lot easier forinformation
 that doesn't fit what would be the corporate america narrativeto reach uh the populations and it would
 be more effective for democracy because they're in a muchbetter position to be informed now
 you're right it also means well if everyone has a mic that means everycrazy person
 and with their wacky views and at a certain point yeah it has to becomethen there's another level which is then
 the people have to be self-enforcing and and you see that on social media allthe time when someone says this the
 other person jumps in

Speaker 1 :you think but isn't social media a good
 example of this like so you think ultimately withoutcentralized control
 you can have stability like what about the mob outrage and the mobrule the
 the power of the mobs that that emerge

Speaker 0 :power of the mob is
 is a very uh serious concern uh gustav labonwrote a book in the 1890s called the
 crowd and this was one of the most important books i've written because itinfluenced both
 mussolini and hitler and stalin and they all talked about it and he made thepoint
 that under crowd psychology human lynching is another example thisnone of those individuals or very few
 would ever dream of doing these acts but whenthey're all together
 and you lose that sense of self you become the ant and you lose that senseof individually
 you're capable of doing things that like in another context you'd be likei should kill myself i'm a monster so


Speaker 1 :you're worried about that but like
 is in the mob doesn't the mob have more power under anarchy

Speaker 0 :no the mob has much less power on
 anarchy because under anarchism every individualis fully empowered you wouldn't have uh
 um uh gun restrictions you would havepeople creating communities based on
 shared values they would be much more collegial they'dbe much more kind
 as opposed to when you're forcing people to be together in a politywhen they don't have things in common
 that is again like having a bad roommate if you're forced to look at jails ifyou're forced to be
 in locked in a room with someone even if you at first like themafter a while you're going to start to
 hate them and that leads to very nefarious consequences

Speaker 1 :so as an anarchist what do you do in a
 society like this

Speaker 0 :thrive i think i'm doing okay
 [Laughter]

Speaker 1 :i mean i mean there's an election coming
 up there's uh as as you talk uh you're welcome is one of the15 shows that you host


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :it's
 you talk about libertarianism a little bit yeah i meanis there some practical
 political direction like in terms of we as a society shouldshould go i don't mean we as a nation i
 mean we as a collective of people should goto uh to make a better world from an
 anarchist point of view sure

Speaker 0 :uh i think politics is the enemy


Speaker 1 :uh and anything i need to find politics


Speaker 0 :so anything that lessens its sway on
 people anything that delegitimizes it is goodi wrote an article a few years ago about
 how wonderful it is that trump is regarded as such a buffoonbecause it's very very useful
 to have a commander-in-chief who's regarded as a clownbecause it's going to take a lot to get
 him to convince your kids to go overseas and start killing people and makingwidows and orphans
 as well as those kids coming home in caskets whereas if someone is regardedwith prestige
 and they're like oh we need to send your kid overseas oh absolutelyi mean this guy's great so that is a
 very healthy thing where people are skeptical of the state

Speaker 1 :but there's a lot of people
 that uh regard him as as one of the greatest leaders we've

Speaker 0 :ever had yeah
 dinesh d'souza he's another lincoln i

Speaker 1 :when you talk [ __ ] about trump or talk
 [ __ ] about biden i think i'm trying to find a line towalk where you they don't immediately
 put you into the this person has trump derangementsyndrome or they have
 the other the alternative to that i i'm

Speaker 0 :more than happy
 when people are preemptively dismissing me because then i don't have to wastetime engaging with them because those
 people will be of no use to me when i was on tim pool recently timpoole's show uh tim poole's known for
 his little like hat i got a propeller beaniemotorized and it was just spinning the
 whole two hours like the 1950s thing the pointbeing i wore it
 because there's lots of people who would say i can't take seriously someone whowears a hat like that
 and my point being if you are the kind of person who takes your cuesbased on someone's wardrobe as opposed
 to the content of your ideas you're of no use to me as an ally so i'dbe more than happy you preemptively
 abort rather than waste our breath this is the deep this

Speaker 1 :is a very very deep thing that you and i
 disagree on which is this is goes to the trolling versus thelove
 is i believe that person instinctually dismisses youon the very basic surface level yes but
 deep down there actually there's a wealth of ahuman being
 that seeks the connection to seeks to understanddeeply to connect with other humans that
 we should speak to

Speaker 0 :i think you and i completely disagree


Speaker 1 :see


Speaker 0 :you're saying i'm saying there's no mind
 there literally

Speaker 1 :okay so let's i naturally i think that
 majority so i naturally think the majority ofpeople are
 have the capacity to be thoughtful intelligent and umyou know learn about ideas ideas that
 they instinctually based on their own likescurrent inner circle disagree with and
 learn to understand to empathize with the other like i andin the current
 climate there's a divisiveness that discourages that andthat's where i see the value of love of
 of encouraging people to to uh to strip away that surface instinctualresponse based on the thing they've been
 taught based on the things they listen to to actually think deeply

Speaker 0 :have you ever had uh gone to cvs or
 dwayne reed and your bill how much you owe them issix dollars
 and you give them a ten dollar bill in a single and watch the look on their faceyou watch them void their bowels and
 panic because you give them eleven dollars on a six dollar billthis is not a mind capable or interested
 in thoughts and ideas learning

Speaker 1 :no you're talking about the first moment
 of uh a for a first moment where there's anopportunity to think


Speaker 0 :they are desperate to avoid it


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :no they're just it's and incapable of it
 i

Speaker 1 :i just it's uh they're they have these
 same exact experiences i have every single daywhen i know it's time for me to go on on
 a run of five miles or six miles or ten miles i'm desperateto avoid it
 and at the same time i know i have the capacity to do itand i'm deeply fulfilled when i do do it
 when i do overcome that challenge

Speaker 0 :you are one of the great minds of our
 generation you are telling me that any of these people can doanything close to the work you do not in


Speaker 1 :artificial intelligence but
 in in inability to be compassionate towards other people's ideas likeunderstand them enough to be able


Speaker 0 :passion requires a certain baseline of
 intelligence because you have to perceive otherpeople as being different but of value
 yeah exactly that's a sophisticated

Speaker 1 :mindset i think i think most people are
 are capable of it you don't think so no

Speaker 0 :and nor are they interested in it


Speaker 1 :but in that kind of if you don't believe
 they're capable of it how can anarchy be stable

Speaker 0 :uh if you have a farm there's one farmer
 and 50 cows it's very stable you're just not you'renot asking the cows
 where to force or where to farm things

Speaker 1 :yeah but the cows aren't intelligent
 enough to do damage

Speaker 0 :cows cows certainly bulls because they
 could do a lot of damage they could trample things they could attack youthe cows are like how much they weigh
 like four thousand pounds can you

Speaker 1 :connect the analogy then because like


Speaker 0 :sure you can't expect yeah saying a cow
 is a cow isn't a slur it's not saying you hatecows cows or even let's say
 the example i always use with good reason is dogs okayuh i always say to study how human
 beings operate watch caesar milan because human beings and dogs haveco-evolved our minds have
 both evolved in parallel tracks to communicate with each other dogs arecan be vicious dogs for the most part
 are great wonderful but you can't expect the dogto understand certain concepts it's not
 an ins and out most people are offended are you saying like a dogif you're a dog person like i am this is
 actually a huge compliment most dogs are better than most peopleum but to get the idea that
 this is something that is basically your peeris nonsensical now of course this sounds
 arrogant and elitist and so on and so forthand i'm perfectly happy with that but it
 is very hard to persuade me or anyone that if youwalk george carlin has that joke think
 how smart the average person is then realize 50of people are dumber than that if you
 walk around and see who's out there these people are very kindthey are of value they they deserve to
 be treated with respect they deserve to be securein their person they deserve to feel
 safe and to have love but the expectation that they should haveany sort of semblance of power over
 me in my life is as nonsensical as asking lassie to be my accountant

Speaker 1 :so but that goes to power that not to uh
 the ability the capacity to be empathetic compassionate intelligentwhat if i were to try to prove you wrong
 that's a good question okay what would what wouldwhat would you be impressed by about
 society well how would i show it to you that's a

Speaker 0 :good question how would you show it to
 me because i think something has to be falsifiable if you're going to make aclaim right
 so what would it what would it

Speaker 1 :because we both made claims that are a
 kind of our own like interpretation based on ourinteraction
 like when i open twitter everyone seems

Speaker 0 :to say why do you only follow one person
 who do you follow who's the one person you follow uh stoic

Speaker 1 :emperor i i follow a lot of people i


Speaker 0 :have a script i have a script


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :this is real love it's not ironic love i
 love watching it and i'm sure you do too ilove watching a quality mind at work
 because when someone has a quality of mind they're often not self-aware icatch this on myself
 of how it operates and then when other people see it they're like oh my godthis is so beautiful because there's
 such an innocence to it

Speaker 1 :yeah but like when i open twitter
 i'm energized there's a lot of love on twitter people say like

Speaker 0 :i love to i agree i have you don't think
 i have a lot of love on twitter my fans pay my rent i mean i don't know

Speaker 1 :your
 experience of twitter but when i look at your which is a fundamentally differentthing
 i'm saying my experience from the so maybe you can tell me what yourexperience is like as a human
 so when i observe your twitter i think i i wouldn't call itlove i would call it
 fun yes and because of that that's a different kind of like loveemerges from that
 because people kind of learn that we're having this is like game nightlike yes uh you know we're we can talk


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :[ __ ] a little bit we can uh and you can
 you can even like pull in you can make fun of people you can havethe crazy uncle come over that
 is a huge trump supporter somebody who hates trump and you can have a littlefun
 yes i get it's a different kind of thing i i wouldn't be able toum uh be the you're the host
 of game night yes yes so i wouldn't be able to host that kind of game

Speaker 0 :you night your robots and you're asking
 what is fun and it just starts sparkling exactly what is fun[Laughter]


Speaker 1 :so the robots in my life that survive
 are the ones that that don't that like survive that wholeprogramming uh process so they're kind
 of like they're kind of like the idiot fromdostoevsky they're very like
 simple-minded

Speaker 0 :robots it's just one is moving a can
 from one table to another yeah

Speaker 1 :that's game night for uh for our kin


Speaker 0 :you know what my quotes is and i i i
 think about this every day and i mean it withevery fiber of my being uh we are born
 knowing that life is a magical adventure and it takes themyears to train us to think otherwise and
 i think that willy wonka approach it's a very camu approachit's something i believe with every
 fiber of my being i try to spread that as much as possiblei think it is very sad i'm not being
 sarcastic i this it comes off as condescending i mean itat face value it's very sad how many
 people are not receptive to that and i think a lot of those functions howthey were raised and i
 i could have very easily with my upbringing have notmaintained that perspective and there's
 a lot of i have a lot of friends in recovery likeaa and they have an expression
 um not my circus not my monkeys right that you can't really take on otherpeople's problems on your own at a
 certain point they have to do the work themselves because you can only do somuch externally
 and there are a lot of very damaged people out thereand there are damaged people who revel
 in being damaged and they are damaged people whodesperately desperately desperately want
 to be well who desperately want to be happy whodesperately want to find joy
 so if i can be the one and as arrogant as it sounds i'll own itwho does give them that fun and to tell
 them it doesn't have to be like you you thoughtlike it could be it's going to hurt it's
 gonna suck but it's still a magical adventure andyou're gonna be okay because you've been
 through worse like that if that could be my message iwould own it all day long


Speaker 1 :and so what does adventure look like for
 you because i mean it actually boils down to i still disagreewith you i think trolling can can be
 and very often as destructive for

Speaker 0 :society you
 yes i want to destroy society that is the goali want i want to help many people
 ironically okay ironically yes

Speaker 1 :what do i do with that okay so whatever


Speaker 0 :you want do what that will


Speaker 1 :is the hall of the law um like i just
 wanna so you're hosting game night and i just wanna play monopoly i wanna play uhwhat's the risk okay i want to play
 these games and you're saying lots of

Speaker 0 :games


Speaker 1 :yeah i was trying to think like of a
 friendlier game but they're all kind of aggressive

Speaker 0 :uh battleship access and allies you know
 fun stuff

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :but like uh so that's an adventure but
 you're saying that we want to destroy everything evenlike
 the rules of those games are are not

Speaker 0 :like you voluntarily agree to those
 rules the point is if someone comes in who's not who no oneinvited to game night
 and are telling you no when you play monopoly you have to get moneywhen you land in free parking or you
 don't yeah it's like who are you yeah we're having our own fun and you

Speaker 1 :smell
 i don't know but there's there's a an aggressive

Speaker 0 :there's an aggression let me let me
 speak to that which i think you're picking up onuh i had a friend named martha marcia
 excuse me she ran something called cuddle parties which people laughed atabout a lot
 back in the day and the premise of the cuddle parties everyone got together andcuddled right and it's like ah
 then you stop to think about and you realize uh physical contact is extremelyimportant
 and a lot of people don't have it and if this is a mechanism of people gettingthat it actually is going to have
 profound positive psychological consequences so after she explained iti'm like okay
 we laughed at this because it's weird and now that i think about this iswonderful
 and and i asked her about like like the tough question i gowhat if guys get turned on and on their
 website it even has a rule like do not fear the erection right because it'sgoing to be a natural consequence
 of physical proximity and the point she goes she said this i think about us allthe time
 people will take as much space as you let them it is incumbent on each of usto set our own boundaries we all have to
 learn when to say no you're making me uncomfortableif someone doesn't respect your right to
 have your boundary to be uncomfortable this person is not your friend nowthey can say i don't understand like why
 is this okay why is that not i let me know you better so i'm respectfulof you but if they roll their eyes and
 they're like get over i'm gonna do what i wantthis person is not interested in knowing
 you as a human being okay that is the aggression it is youhave to draw those lines


Speaker 1 :i mean but that's a very positive way of
 phrasing that aggression

Speaker 0 :i'm a very positive person but the


Speaker 1 :trolling
 there's a destructive thing to it yes that hurtsothers yes but it's not bad people


Speaker 0 :oh i only troll as a reaction or towards
 those in power

Speaker 1 :okay so maybe let's talk about trolling
 a little bit because trolling when it can maybe you cancorrect me
 but i've seen it become a game for people that's enjoyable

Speaker 0 :in itself i i'm not i'm not i i disagree
 with that but that's not a good thing if you arethere just to hurt innocent people
 you are a horrible human being but

Speaker 1 :doesn't trolling
 too easily become that uh i don't know

Speaker 0 :about easily let me give you an example
 of the the where trolling came from theoriginal troll was andy kaufman
 he was on the show taxi he was a stan he was a performance artist not a standardcomedian
 and this is a quintessential example of trolling he had a characterum where he was basically like a lounge
 singer he had these glasses on and just a terrible terrible singer andso on and so forth and he denied it was
 him and he came out and i'm blanking on theguy's name i can't believe it tony
 clifton yeah he came out in the audience and hegoes you know
 my wife died a few years ago every time i look at my daughter sarah's eyes icould see my wife sarah come out here
 let's do a duet and sarah's like 11. sits on his lapthey start singing duet
 her voice cracks he smacks her across the face what the hell are you doingyou're making ass in front of these
 people they're they're she starts crying the audience is booing and goes don'tbore you're just going to make her cry
 more now it ends this wasn't his daughterit wasn't even a child was an actress
 this was all set up he's exploiting their love of children in order to forcethem to be performers
 that is trolling no one is actually getting hurtit's a humorous the twisted exchange
 if you go online looking for weak people and you are there to denigrate them justfor them being weak
 or in some way inferior to you that is the wrongapproach i am best on the counter punch
 a lot of times people come to me and they'll be like i hope you dieyou're ugly you're disgusting and
 there's this great quote from billy idol which i'm going to mangle where he sumsin the effect of
 i love it when people are rude to me then i can stop pretending to be nicethen you start fights now it's a chance
 for me to finish it and make an example of this personbut that's very very different from i'm
 gonna go around and humiliate people for the sake ofdoing it in my view
 and i can see how one would lead to the other yeah but that's my fundamental

Speaker 1 :concern with it so i
 my dream is to put use technology create platforms that uh increase theamount of love in the world
 and to me trolling is doing the opposite solike andy kaufman is brilliant so i love
 obviously it sounds like i'm a robot saying i lovehumor okay


Speaker 0 :humor is good one one zero one one one
 one

Speaker 1 :but but like it's
 i just see like 4chan i see that you can often see that humor quicklyturn


Speaker 0 :yeah because what happens is a lot of
 low status people this is their one mechanismthrough sadism uh to feel empowered
 and then they can hide behind well i'm just jokingas this


Speaker 1 :that people do which is like they'll say
 like the shittiest thing right and then they feellol after
 like as if i don't i don't even know like what is happening in the dark

Speaker 0 :mind of yours because they are feeling
 powerless in their lives right and they see someone who theyperceive as higher status or more
 powerful than them or even not appear and they through their words cause areaction
 in this person so they feel like they are in a very literal sense making adifference on earth and they matter in a
 very dark way uh it's it's disturbing this is not imean it's unfortunate that that term
 trolling is used for that as opposed to what andykaufman does as opposed to what i do
 um it's it really is uh a sinister thing and it's something i'm not at all a fanof or how do we


Speaker 1 :how do we fight that so like
 a neighboring concept of that is conspiracy theorieswhich is i don't think they're


Speaker 0 :neighboring at all


Speaker 1 :well let me let me give myself a naive
 perspective maybe you can educate me on this from my perspectiveconspiracy theories are these constructs
 of ideas that go deeper and deeper and deeperinto
 creating worlds where there's powerful pedophilescontrolling things like these
 uh very sophisticated models of the worldthat you know in part might be true but
 in large part i would say are are figments of imagination thatbecome
 really useful constructs and self-reinforcingself-reinforcing for then feeding
 like empowering the trolls to attack the powerfulthe conventionally powerful i i don't


Speaker 0 :think that that's a function conspiracy
 theories now let's talk about conspiracy theories because one of my quotes is youtake one red pill not the whole bottle
 this concept that everything in life is at the function of a small cadre ofindividuals
 would be for many people reassuring because as bad as it looksyou know they whoever they are it's
 usually the jews aren't going to let it get that bad thatthey will pull back or
 the the black pill is that they are intentionallytrying to destroy everything and there's
 nothing we can do and we're doomed and there's an amazing book by arthur hermancalled the idea of decline western
 history i it's one of my top 10 books where hegoes through every 20 years how there's
 a different population that say it's the end of the world here's theproof and very often the proof is
 something that is kind of self-fulfilling where there's noit's not falsifiable
 and we both have to think of ways to falsify our claims from earlier yeah soit is a big danger it's a big danger
 online because very quickly if someone who youthought was good
 but now is bad on one aspect well they're controlled oppositionor they've been uh taken over or they've
 been kind of uh appropriated by the bad peoplewhoever those bad people would be
 um i don't know that i have a good answer for thisi don't think it's as pervasive as
 people think

Speaker 1 :the number of people who believe


Speaker 0 :conspiracy theory right the i mean and
 also conspiracy theory is a term used to dismiss ideas that have somecurrency the constitutional convention
 was a conspiracy uh the founding fathers got togethersecretly under water secrecy in
 philadelphia said we're throwing out the articles of confederation we're makingnew government right yeah
 yeah and luther martin left and he told everyone this is a conspiracy andthey're like yeah whatever luther morgan
 so and jeffrey epstein was a conspiracy harvey weinstein was a conspiracy billcosby conspiracy they all knew
 they didn't care uh communist infiltration in america there's a greatbook by
 eugene lyons called the red decade they all knew theyevery atrocity that uh was done under
 stalinism was excused in the west and if you didn'tbelieve it oh you've got this crazy
 anti-russian conspiracy so it's a term that is weaponized uh ina negative sense
 but that does not all imply that it does not have verynegative real life consequences because
 it's kind of a cult of one right like i'm at home on my computer i bang tothis ideology
 anyone who doesn't agree with me they're blindthey're oblivious mom and dad my friends
 you don't get it we were warned about people like you andi think there's a very heavy correlation
 and i'm not a psychiatrist of course between that and certain types of mildmelt illness like uh you know some kind
 of paranoid schizophrenia things like that becauseafter a certain point if everything is a
 function this conspiracy it's it's there's no randomness orbeauty in life


Speaker 1 :yeah i mean i don't know if you can say
 anything interesting about it in the way of advice of how totake a step into conspiracy theory world
 without completely going like diving deepbecause it seems like that's what
 happens people can't look at jeffrey epstein i can tell you

Speaker 0 :what the device i'd have


Speaker 1 :seriously and rigorously without going
 because you can look at jeffrey epstein and say there's a deeperthing you can always go deeper right
 it's like jeffrey epstein was just the toolof uh the lizard people and the lizard
 people are

Speaker 0 :well they say satanists in this case and


Speaker 1 :somehow recently very popular pedophiles
 somehow always involved i'm not understanding any of that ilegitimately i say this both humorously
 and seriously i need to look into it and i guess the bigger question i'masking how does a serious human being
 uh somebody with a position at a respectable universitylike look at a conspiracy theory and
 look into it when i look at somebody like jeffrey epsteinwho had a role at mit
 yeah oh yeah and i and i think i'm not happy personallyi didn't i wasn't there when jeffrey
 epstein was there i'm not happy with the behavior of peoplenow about jeffrey epstein about the
 bureaucracy and the everybody's trying to keep quiet hopingit blows over without really looking
 into any like looking in a deep philosophical way of like how do welet this human being be
 among us can i give you a better example

Speaker 0 :sure that that is
 kind of conspiratorial the speaker of the house the longest serving republicanspeaker of the house dennis hastert was
 a pedophile he went to jail the democrats don'tthrow this in the republicans faces
 every five minutes not even democratic activists i findthat very very odd
 and not what i would predict now i'm not saying there's some kind of conspiracybut when it comes to things like sexual
 predation which is something that i'm very very concerned about i'm anuncle now my sister just had her second
 kid recently he's adorable um it's something thati don't understand if it feels
 as if there's a lot of people who want this to all go awaynow i think it's also because we don't
 have the vocabulary and framework to discuss itbecause when you start talking about
 things like children these kind of issueswe want to believe it's all crap because
 it's for those of us who aren't in this kind of mindset the ideathat this happens to kids and happens
 frequently is something so horrible yeah that we it's just like i don't evenwant to hear it and that does
 these children and adult survivors an enormous disserviceso i don't know that i have any
 particular insight on this but see like

Speaker 1 :how do you
 i mean the catholic church again there's all these topics that

Speaker 0 :public school teachers are far more
 proportionally uh better as the children of the catholic church

Speaker 1 :i mean i don't know what i you're right
 you're right um perhaps some uh i've been you know reading a lotabout
 stalin and hitler yeah somehow it's more comfortingyeah like to be here and then and then
 and then the atrocities that are happening nowit's a little bit more difficult because


Speaker 0 :there was a new york times article
 interrupted where they were had a people tracking down child pornographyand i think the article said they didn't
 have enough people just to cover the videotapes of infants being raped and wecan even wrap our heads around like
 reading lolita like okay she's 14 12. okay it's still afemale an infant
 it's it's something that again like with the stalin examplewe sat down here for a hundred years we
 would never think of something like this think of in a sexual context it makes nosense
 yeah um so and the fact that this is international okay we eliminatedcompletely in america
 well then they're gonna go find this there's infants all over the worldthere's video cameras over the world
 so then it has to become a conspiracy because isomeone has to film it i'm filming it
 you're buying it your kid it is literally a conspiratorial not inthe sense of like a mafia conspiracy or
 some government illuminati but there is our networks designed toproduce this


Speaker 1 :product see but like what i'm
 i'm trying to do now i mean part of the one of the nice things with like apodcast and other things i'm involved
 with is i'm removing myself from having anykind of boss
 so i can do whatever yes oh it's so it's

Speaker 0 :so wonderful that just happened to me
 it's it's the most wonderful thing ever

Speaker 1 :so i could do i can actually in
 moderation consider like look into stuff careful

Speaker 0 :though i was going to write a book about
 this and people pointed out you sure want to do this researchbecause if you start googling around for
 this kind of stuff it's on your computer

Speaker 1 :oh in that sense yeah i'm more concerned
 about you know it's the nietzsche thinglooking into the abyss like you want to
 be very yeah i believe i can do this kind ofthing in moderation without slipping
 oh yes into the depths of course i think that's that's intelligence that'suh like i recently quote unquote looked
 into like the ufo community the umextraterrestrial
 whatever community i think it always frustrated methat the scientific community like
 rolled their eyes at all the ufo sightings all that kind of stuffeven though there could be fascinating
 beautiful physical fun like first of all there could be likelightning or the ball lightning right
 that's at the very basic level is a fascinating thingand also it could be
 something like i mean i i don't know but this could be something interestinglike worth looking into my grandfather


Speaker 0 :was an air traffic controller back in
 the soviet union and he said we saw this stuff all thetime these are planes that were not
 moving or whatever things that were not moving according toanything we knew about so it's
 absolutely real he's not some jerk with an iphone in hisbackyard
 this is a a military professional who understood technology who knew wherethe secret bases were so if he's telling
 me it's something doesn't mean it'smartians but he's telling me there's
 something there and there are many examples of of these like militarypeople these aren't some laymen who sees
 a story they're legit people yeah and and so it's you you can dismiss whenyou're talking about professionals who
 are around aircraft all the time who are familiarwith aircraft at the highest levels
 and they're seeing things that they can't explain it's they're clearly notstupid and they're clearly not under
 form so might

Speaker 1 :there's different ways to dismiss ideas
 for example i i'm uh you were saying that trolling isa good mechanism
 i'm against that but i'm not dismissing it bylike rolling my eyes i'm considering
 legitimately that you're way smarter than meand you understand the world better than
 me like i'm allow myself to consider that possibility and thinking about itlike
 maybe that's true like seriously considering it that's whatthat's i feel the way people should
 approach intelligent people serious quote-unquotepeople scientists should approach
 conspiracy theories like look at it carefully you know is first of all isit possible that the earth is flat
 it's not trivial to show that the earth is not flat it's a very good exerciseyou should go through it
 yes but once you go through it you realize thatuh based on a lot of data and a lot of
 evidence and there's a lot of different experiments you could do yourselfactually
 to show that the earth is not flat okay the same kind of process can be takenfor a lot of different conspiracy
 theories and it's helpful and without slipping into the depths ofof lizard people running everything
 that's where i i've now listened to two episodesof um of alex jones's show
 because he goes crazy deep into uminto different kind of world views that
 i was not familiar with right and i don't know what to make of it imean the reason i've been listening to
 it is because um there's been a lot of discussionsabout platforming of different people
 and i've been thinking about what is censorship meani've been thinking about it whether
 because joe rogan uh said he's gonna have alex on againand then i enjoyed it as a fan just the
 entertainment of it but then i actually listened to alexand i was thinking is this human being
 dangerous for the world like is the ideas he's saying dangerous

Speaker 0 :for the world i'm more concerned with
 the russian conspiracy that we had for three yearsand the claim that our election was not
 legitimate and that everyone in the trump white house is a stooge of putinuh and the people who said this had no
 consequences for this alex jones doesn't have the respect that they douh these are both areas of concern for


Speaker 1 :me but he he might if there's if he's
 given more platforms so like the the the the people who've and i'd be curiousif
 i'm also a little bit i don't know what to think about the idea thatrussians hacked the election the it
 seems too easily accepted in the mainstream mediahillary clinton said that how they did


Speaker 0 :it
 was they had ads on the dark web now you and i both know what the darkweb is so
 the possibility of ads in the dark web having an influencefrom a proportional influence on the
 election is literally zero

Speaker 1 :perhaps i should look into it more
 carefully but i've found very little gooddata on exactly
 what did the russians do to hack elections likelike technically speaking what are we
 talking about here like as opposed to these kind of weird likethe best thing there's a couple books
 and like reporting on like farmscontrol farms troll farms but
 let's see the data like how many exactly what are we talking about likewhat were they doing
 relative not just like some anecdotal discussions ofbut like relative to the bigger
 the size of facebook like if there's a fewpeople several hundred say the posting
 different political things on facebook relative to the full size of facebooklet's look at the full
 size like right you're thinking like a scientist the actual impact like thebecause it's fascinating the social
 dynamics of viral information of videos when when uh donald trumpretweets something
 i think that's understudied the effect of that uhlike he retweeted a clip with joe rogan
 on uh with and mike tyson where mike tysonsays that
 he finds fighting orgasmic i don't understand that but it'd be fascinatingto think like what is the ripple effect
 on the social uh dynamic of our society fromretweeting a clip about mike ty what's


Speaker 0 :your favorite um um


Speaker 1 :trump tweet i i tuned the model a long
 time ago unfortunately i have um it's the this goes to theyou and i have a different relationship
 with donald trump you appreciate the art form of trollingnon-sexual non-sexual yeah so
 i i tend to prefer uh bill clinton he's more my type no i'm just kidding uh i

Speaker 0 :don't know
 you don't like that consent stuff no

Speaker 1 :because no
 uh no you appreciate the art form of trolling and and uh donald trump isis uh a a master he's the da vinci
 of trolling so i tend to think that trolling is ultimatelydestructive for society
 and then donald trump takes nothing seriously he's playing a gamehe's making a game out of everything


Speaker 0 :takes a lot of things seriously i think
 he's very committed to

Speaker 1 :international peace i say i i shouldn't
 speak so strongly i think i think it takes actually yes a lot ofthings seriously i meant
 on twitter and the game of politics yeah he is um[Music]


Speaker 0 :he only takes irreverently yeah yeah and


Speaker 1 :um i appreciate it i just
 would like to focus on like genuine real expressions of humanity especiallypositive


Speaker 0 :well this is my love this is my favorite
 tweet my fans got it laser etched and put in a block oflucite for me and he said
 every time i speak of the losers and haters i do so with great affectionthey cannot help the fact that they were
 born [ __ ] up that's an actual trump tweet it's my favorite one

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :and that's kind of nice that's love
 that's love that's kind of nice

Speaker 1 :that i mean exclamation point


Speaker 0 :even
 um i broke legs what is love

Speaker 1 :yeah the sparks are flying but uh i have
 to kind of analyze that from like aliterary perspective but
 it seems like there's love in there like a little bit like

Speaker 0 :it's a little bit light-hearted because
 he's saying even when i'm going after them don't take it so seriouslyyeah that's that's nice it is nice
 acknowledging the game of it

Speaker 1 :yes that's nice uh he's not always


Speaker 0 :something he's very very vicious yeah
 very vicious he's done things that i i can tell youabout that i'm like this is a bad person


Speaker 1 :what do you think about one of the okay
 listen i'm not i for people listening i do not havetrump derangement syndrome
 i'm i don't i see i try to look for the good and the bad in everybodyone thing perhaps it's irrational but
 perhaps because i've been reading historyi the one triggering thing for me
 is the delaying of elections i believe in elections and[Music]
 this is this is the part that you probably disagree withbut i you know i believe in the value of
 people voting and i just seen too many dictators thethe place where they finally the big
 switch happens when you question the legitimacy ofelections who's been questioning the


Speaker 0 :legitimacy of elections for the last
 three years

Speaker 1 :i've only heard donald trump do it last
 like year but the last three years you're sayingsomebody else you don't think not my


Speaker 0 :president
 illegitimate we're not going to normalize him as president russia hackedthis election
 impeached you're not a real president you don't think that's questioninglegitimacy of 2016.


Speaker 1 :no it's a good uh i haven't been paying
 attention enough but i would i would imagine that argumenthas been
 that i haven't actually heard too many people but i imagine that's been apopular
 oh very much yeah okay i but nevertheless that's a part thatdidn't uh
 that's not a statement that gained power enough to saythat um barack obama will keep being
 president or hillary clinton should be president

Speaker 0 :newsweek had that article how hillary
 clinton could still be president newsweek

Speaker 1 :no but she's not that's what i'm saying
 my worry isn't my worry isn't uh saying that theelection was illegitimate and people
 whining and mass scale and then the fox news or cnn reportingfor years or books being written
 for years my worry is legitimately martial lawa person's ma stays president


Speaker 0 :so here's the issue like there's a


Speaker 1 :there's a


Speaker 0 :shift that i have not i i i did a book
 on north korea i'm not someone who thinks dictatorshipshould be taken lightly
 i'm not someone who thinks it can't happen here uh i i think a lot of timespeople are desperate for dictatorship so
 i am with you and i think this issomething if you're going to hand wave
 it away everyone else hand waved it awayhitler's never going to be chancellor
 he's a lunatic he's a joke he's a joke that he theycouldn't find a publisher from mineconf
 in english because this is a guy from some randomminor party in germany spouting nonsense
 who's going to read this crap you know so i i completely agree withyou uh you don't think we're there
 my point is donald trump this year had every uh pathway open to him todeclare martial law
 the cities were being burnt down he could have very easily sent in the tanksuh and people would have been applauding
 him from his side he feels so good right now but am i wrong thoughno i what he did he tweeted out to mayor
 wheeler of portland he said call mewe will we will solve this in minutes
 but you have to call and he sat in his hands andthey said oh it's his fault
 the city is burning down he's not doing anything and he goes i'm not doinganything until you ask me to do it so i
 think that is even if you think he's an aspiringdictator
 that is at least a sign that there is some restrainton his aspirations can i just


Speaker 1 :take that in as a beautiful um
 like moment of hope so i'm i'm gonna remember this

Speaker 0 :ted cruz beautiful ted i'm gonna i'm


Speaker 1 :gonna remember that i mean
 uh i i should say that perhaps i'm irrationally this is the one momentwhere i feel myself being a little


Speaker 0 :i i don't like it i think there's an
 asymmetry because it's kind of like okay either iif i leave the house it's like russian
 roulette yeah maybe it's like a one and six shoti'm pulling the trigger i'm killing
 myself but that's one in six that's not and and theconsequences are so dire
 that a little paranoia would go a long way there's something that you can't go

Speaker 1 :back


Speaker 0 :yeah you it's an asymmetry yeah and the


Speaker 1 :the thing is
 the thing that makes donald trump new to meand again i'm a little naive in these
 things but he surprised mein how many ways he just didn't play by
 the rules yeah and he's made me a little ant in thisant colony
 think like well do you have to play by the rules at allright like why are we having elections
 why just say like it's coronavirus time like it'sit's uh not healthy to have elections
 like we shouldn't be like i could if i put my dictator hat on

Speaker 0 :nancy pelosi said that joe biden
 shouldn't debate

Speaker 1 :yeah uh did she yes she says


Speaker 0 :she shouldn't dignify trump with the
 debate he's the president he could be the worst president on earth evildespicable monster
 i'll take that as an argument so she's

Speaker 1 :playing politics but she's i don't think


Speaker 0 :that's playing politics i think when
 there's a certain point where things get and when things get uh when you startattacking institutions
 for the the emergencies at the moment and acting arbitrarily that is whenthings
 are the slippery slope yeah so you're

Speaker 1 :saying debates is one of the
 institutions like that's one of the traditions to have the debates

Speaker 0 :i think the debates are extremely
 important uh and now i don't think that someone's a good debater is going tomake a good president
 i mean that's that's a big problem but you're just saying this is attacking

Speaker 1 :just yet another
 tradition yet another you know like how

Speaker 0 :if you're dating if you're married to
 someone and someone throws out the word divorce you can't unring that bell youthrew it out there
 yeah i'm saying you don't throw things out like that unlessyou really are ready to go down this
 road and i think that is there's nothing in the constitutionabout debates we've only had them since
 1980 but still i think they are extremelyimportant it's also a great chance for
 joe biden to tell him to his face you're full of crap here's what you didhere's what you did here's what you did


Speaker 1 :it's so fascinating that you're
 both you acknowledge that and you you also see the value oftearing down the entire
 thing so you're both worried about no debatesor at least in your voice in your tone


Speaker 0 :there's a great quote by chesterton
 i'm not a fan of him at all but he says before you tear down a fence make sureyou know why they put it up first
 so i am for tearing it all down but there's something called a controlleddemolition like building seven
 um or there's allegedly we knew we were in tel aviv um and

Speaker 1 :hashtag building seven we knew we were
 intelligent

Speaker 0 :wow you're faster than me you're you're


Speaker 1 :operating in a different level
 i need to upgrade my operating system i told you when it was 95.

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah um building seven


Speaker 0 :if you're gonna uh it's like indiana
 jones right if you're gonna tear pull something away make sure you havesomething in place first as opposed to
 just breaking it and then just especially in politics it because itescalates and when things escalate
 without any kind of response it it can go in a very badthat's when napoleon comes in


Speaker 1 :so what's your prediction about
 the the biden trump debates again i just have this weird maybe we'llreturn to
 maybe not in this how do we put more love into the worldand like one of the things that worries
 me about the debates is it'll be um it'll be the the world'sgreatest troll against the
 the grandpa and the porch who grabbed his pantsyeah yeah and it'll it will not put more
 love into the world it it will it will create more mockery

Speaker 0 :like uh joe biden did a great job
 against paul ryan in 2012. paul ryan was nolightweight no one thought he was a
 lightweight joe biden handed sarah pale in her assin 2008
 which isn't as easy to do as you think because she's a female so you're goingto come off as bullying that's something
 you have to worry about so the guy isn't umi think he is in the stages of like
 cognitive decline um so i think it's going to beinteresting uh
 i want it to be um like mike tyson beating up a childbecause it'll be a source of amusement
 to me um but i don't know how it's gonna gobecause it's possible that joe biden


Speaker 1 :will be the mike tyson


Speaker 0 :yes because in his last debate with
 bernie he was perfectly fine and again the guy was a center fordecades and i don't think anyone
 if you looked at joe biden in 2010 would have thought this guy is going tobe have his ass handed him a debate you
 wouldn't think that at all so i don't know who we're going to seeplus he's got a lot of
 room to attack trump so i'm sure he's gonna come strapped and readyand he's gonna have his talking points
 and watch trump dance try to tap dance around him and ifhe's in a position i know the rules of
 the debate are to actually nail him to the wall itmight actually i'm sure he's gonna have
 a lot of lines too the problem is trump is themaster counter puncher
 so he like when hillary's you know had her line she's like well it's a goodthing
 that donald trump isn't in charge of our legal system he's like yeah he'd be injail
 it's like it's like oh like you lady you set him up that's painful to watch yeah

Speaker 1 :those those debates i mean there's
 something uh i think it's actually analogous umi've come to think of it uh your
 conversation with me right now some sleepy joe i'm playing the role ofsleepy joe
 i actually connect to uh joe

Speaker 0 :because they're also incontinent


Speaker 1 :there's like these weird pauses


Speaker 0 :i do the same i do the same thing it


Speaker 1 :annoys the [ __ ] out of me
 that like uh in mid-sentence i'll start saying a different thing

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :and take a tangent i'm not as slow and
 drunk as i sound always i swear i'm more

Speaker 0 :intelligent underneath lower but less
 drunk

Speaker 1 :exactly but the result one of those is
 true but not both yeah andand and trump just like you are a master
 counter puncher so it's going to be messy here's the other

Speaker 0 :thing in all seriousness
 chris wallace is the moderator chris wallace has interviewed trump severaltimes and he
 was a tough tough questioner so i don't think he's going to come inthere with softball questions i think
 he's really going to try to nail trump downwhich is tough to do
 i like him a lot yeah he's rea and he's like mr president sir that's notaccurate blah blah he's done it and
 trump gets very frustrated because he doesn't just let him saywhatever he wants and he he hits him
 with the follow-up

Speaker 1 :he's he's uh i guess he's on fox news
 and he i listen to his sunday program uh everyonce in a while
 uh he gives me hope that i don't know there's something in the voice likethat he's not bought he's i i there's no


Speaker 0 :question he's going to take this
 seriously which i think is the best you could hopefor in a moderator


Speaker 1 :like it feels like there's people that
 might actually take the mainstream media into a place that's going to be betterin the future
 and like we need people like him you mean like rob spear

Speaker 0 :what do you mean like taking the
 mainstream media to a better future like bring out the guillotinesokay see you you put your anarchist hat


Speaker 1 :back on


Speaker 0 :i don't think robster is much of an
 anarchist but yeah i get what you're saying yeah

Speaker 1 :you don't think there should be a
 centralized place for news there isn't

Speaker 0 :now


Speaker 1 :well that's what mainstream media is
 supposed to represent broken well it's not whatever uh whatwould he call that
 a place where people traditionally said was thelike the legitimate source of truth no
 that's what the media was supposed to represent no i

Speaker 0 :said i that's their that's their big
 branding uh accomplishment it's okay that was nevertrue yeah because if we here's what
 happens we remember the spanish-american war remember themaine we have to take cuba
 yellow journalism willie randolph first right then record scratchand then we're all objective like when
 did this transition happen according to people when you were saying that thekaiser
 is uh the worst human being on earth when you were downplaying uh stalinand down playing hitler's atrocities
 when you were saying we had to be in vietnamat what point wmds when did it change it
 never changed you just are better con artists at a certain pointand now the mask is dropping yeah but


Speaker 1 :don't you think there's uh
 at its best like investigative journalism canuncover truth in a way that um
 that like reddit uh subreddits can't

Speaker 0 :you know read it sure i agree at its
 best absolutely that's not even dispute

Speaker 1 :but like don't you think uh
 like fake it until you make it is the right way to do it meaning likethe take the news no no no i meant
 the new saying like we dream of doing of arriving at the truth and reportingthe truth
 they don't say that cnn had an

Speaker 0 :advertisement that said this is an apple
 we only report facts that's a lie no

Speaker 1 :that's
 now and now it's clear things have changed and they haven't changed you're

Speaker 0 :just more
 you're more aware of chicanery but

Speaker 1 :okay so the how many people died in iraq


Speaker 0 :because saddam hussein was about to
 launch wmds who had consequences for this no onethis isn't a minor thing this is
 lots of dead people yeah

Speaker 1 :and also i mean dead people
 it's horrible but also the money which has like we said economic effects

Speaker 0 :marian williamson i think it was it was
 had trump both of them had the great point that goesthat's like a trillion dollars how many
 schools would that build how many roads did that build evenhere why are we building hospitals in
 iraq that we destroyed when we could building hospitals hereit makes no sense it's horrifying so


Speaker 1 :who's responsible for that like
 who um alex jones

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :now meant for well uh so who's
 responsible for arriving at the truth of that of speaking to the money spenti think this is wars in iraq this is one


Speaker 0 :of the great things about social media


Speaker 1 :twitter you have faith in twitter not


Speaker 0 :not specifically twitter but yeah social
 media as a whole what anyone could be here's a great another great examplebefore
 if you were talking about police brutality or these riotsyou would have to perceive it in the way
 it was framed and presented to nicholas sandman is another exampleuh brianna taylor all these things well
 you're not footage of her you would have to perceive in the waythat it's edited and presented to you by
 the corporate press now everyone is a video who has videocamera everyone has their perspective
 and it's very useful when these incidents happen where you could see thesame incident from several angles
 and you don't need don lemon or chris wallace to tell me what this means i cansee with my own


Speaker 1 :eyes yeah i've been very
 pleasantly surprised about the power see like peoplethe mob again gets in the way they get
 emotional and they destroy like thethe ability for people to reason but
 you're right that truth is unobstructed on social medialike if you're if you're careful and
 patient you can see the truth yeah like for example data on coven some ofthe best sources
 are doctors like if you want to know the truth about the coronavirus of what'shappening
 is uh there's follow people on twitter yeah there's certain people there yeslike sourcing for me
 versus the cdc and the wa show it's that's that's fast i mean it's well it'skind of anarchy right it's yes


Speaker 0 :it is it's anarchy yes i mean well


Speaker 1 :there's some
 censorship and all that kind of stuff

Speaker 0 :you have censorship under anarchy in the
 sense that you're talking about like people bekicked off on twitter that's a drawing


Speaker 1 :somebody okay
 so i mean it's a private company private

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :company
 most people wouldn't say twitter's working but they that's probably becausethey take for granted
 how well it's working and they're just complaining about the small part of it

Speaker 0 :that's broken right


Speaker 1 :okay another question about don't you


Speaker 0 :feel better


Speaker 1 :no by the way i mean i had a personal
 gripe with the situation about the um not a personal gripe but i feltoverly
 emotional about um the possibility that there will be someof donald trump
 messing with the election process but you made me feel better likesaying like he if he had a bunch of
 opportunities to um to do what liketo do what i would have done if i was a
 dictator i would um the first time those rides over georgefloyd i would instituted
 um martial law do you know what i

Speaker 0 :remember very vividly
 is after 9 11 and everyone was waiting for george bush to give his speechand he had 98 approval rating and i
 remember very vividly because if he had saidwe're suspending the constitution
 everyone had cheered for him like he couldn't get enough support atthat time and he didn't do it
 and i can't say anything really good about george w bush i'm not a fan of histo say the least
 so i think you and i and you know other people who are familiar with you knowuh totalitarian regimes to some extent
 from our ancestry or whatever from researchshould always be the ones freaking out
 and warning but we should also be aware of we got aways to go
 before it's hitler and thankfully uh there are a lot of dominoes that haveto fall into place before hitler it's
 like the game secret hitler it's a board gamebefore hitler becomes hitler like it's
 not e especially in america there's lots ofthings that have to happen
 before you really get to that point i mean fdr was for all intensive purposesof dictator
 but even then the worst you could say and this is not something that you takelightly
 was internment of japanese citizens but they weren't murdereduh they weren't you know uh you know
 under lock and key in the sense of like in cellsso things could have gotten a lot worse
 for him we have to i mean hitler is such

Speaker 1 :a horrible person to bring up because
 mussolini you know yeah mussolini is better becausehitler is so closely connected to the
 atrocities of the holocaust right there's all the stuff that led up to thewar and the war itself say that there
 was no uh holocaust hitler will probably beviewed differently


Speaker 0 :i should yes i should think so well i
 mean but you think that's a verycontroversial stance you think hitler
 viewed differently if it wasn't for the holocaust

Speaker 1 :well i mean
 but it's a funny thing that the the the i would say the death of how many40 50 million i mean i don't know how
 you calculate it as is not seen as as bad as the 6million oh yeah because of mountain and


Speaker 0 :stalin


Speaker 1 :yeah yeah and it but it's interesting uh
 working on it you're working on yeah the

Speaker 0 :next book i'm talking reminding what's


Speaker 1 :good
 i'm i'm glad a good writer is because i'm not reminded my last book the new

Speaker 0 :right you know i had to deal with some
 like the nazis and one of the points they make is how come everyone knowsabout the holocaust but no one knows
 about the holodomor and they're right we should know aboutthis because it is a great example of
 both how the western media were depraved but also what human beingsare capable of
 and those scars are still you know many americans think russia and ukraine arethe same thing
 you know that like oh trump's in bed with ukrainians trump's about therussians they think it's the same thing
 is for us it's complete lunacy but this is the kind of thing wherepol pot is another example uh where
 people have no clue of what has been done to their fellowman on the face of this earth and they
 should know

Speaker 1 :how much of that do you lay at the hands
 of communism how much are you with like ajordan pearson who has as
 intricately connecting the atrocities likelike you're saying 1930s ukraine where
 people were starved um i recently said my grandmotherrecently passed away and she
 she looked she survived that as like as a kid which isit's fat those people i mean
 just they're tough they're tough like that whole region is tough becausethey survived that
 and then right after the occupation of

Speaker 0 :nazis


Speaker 1 :yeah of germans um how much do you lay
 that at communism as an ideology versus umstalin the man


Speaker 0 :uh i think you know lenin was building
 concentration camps you know while he was around in slave labor umi i don't i think it's clearly both
 there are certain variants of communism that were far like khrushchev you knowand gorbachev
 uh the reason the soviet union fell apart and this is kind of i'm going tospoil the end of the book
 there's an amazing book called revolution 1989 it's like the mostbeautiful book i've ever read
 by victor sebastian he's a hungarian author and basically what happens in1989 poland has their elections and then
 then in 1990 they kind of let in the labor people into the governmentand people start crossing borders you
 know in the eastern bloc and you had hanukkah from easterngermany and uh chances
 from romania colin gorbachev because those are the two toughest onesby communist standards they go they're
 they're just escaping we're gonna we're gonna lose everythingyou gotta send in the tanks like you did
 in hungary like you did in czech republic surviving 68and gorbachev goes i'm not sending the
 tanks and they go dude if you don't sing in the tanksit's all done and he goes nope i'm not
 that kind of guy and they were right i mean they uhcoaches was personally shot
 with his wife up against the wall hanukkah i forget what happened to himbut it they all self-liberated my friend
 who was born in czech czechoslovakia his mom was pregnant youknow under communism and she never even
 imagined he'd be free and he was born under freeuh and they were all looking around all
 these countries that self-liberated because they're like this is a trickright they're just they're trying to
 figure out who's like not good so that they can arrest us on mass andthey didn't so
 although even within communism there are bad guys and better guys but we talked

Speaker 1 :about anarchy we talk about democracy
 do you see like there's democratic socialism conversations going onin the popular culture socialism is seen
 as like evil or for some people great surewhat like what are your thoughts about
 is in a political ideology evil so you're on the evil side yesfundamentally
 yes what what what is it you know what yeah what makes it evilwhat's like structurally
 if you were to try to analyze like sure

Speaker 0 :this i say three ways
 morally no person has the right to tell another person how to live their lifeum economically it's not possible to
 make calculations under socialism it's only theprice the prices that are information
 that tells me oh this is we need to produce more of this we need to produceless of this
 without prices being able to adjust and give information to producers andand consumers you have no way of being
 able to produce uh effectively efficiently and alsoit is uh it turns people against each
 other when you force people to interact whenyou force them into relationships when
 you force them into jobs and you don't give them any choice whenthere's a monopoly uh the consequence of
 monopoly everyone's familiar with ostensibly under capitalism but somehowwhen it's a government monopoly
 all those economic principles don't work doesn't make any sense but there's force

Speaker 1 :in democracy too
 it's just you're saying there's a there's a bit more force in uhin socialism yeah but that's interesting
 that you say that there's not enough information i mean that's ultimatelyyou need to have really good data yes
 to achieve the goals of the system even even if there's no corruptionright you just need to have the
 information right which you can't and capitalism provides you umlike really strong real-time real-time
 information that um and if likecapitalism at its best and cleanest
 which is like perfect information is availablethere's no manipulation of information
 that's what you know that's one of the problems okaycan we talk about some candidates
 the ones we got and possible alternativesso one question i have is why
 do we have within this system why do we have the candidates we haveis it seems um maybe you can correct me
 highly unsatisfactory like the like is anyone actually excited aboutour current candidates


Speaker 0 :i'm kind of excited because no matter
 who wins the elections can be hilarious so that is something that i'm excited

Speaker 1 :about from uh from a human perspective
 yeah is that what the whole system is uh sothat's the one theory of the case
 is the entire thing is optimized for viewershipyeah and uh excitement by definitions of
 like the reality show kind of excitement

Speaker 0 :i think it is if you look at what
 happened with brett kavanaugh this is not a career that woulddraw people who are you might say
 quality because no matter who they are therewould be a huge incentive from the other
 team to denigrate them and humiliate them inthe worst possible ways because
 as the two teams lose their legitimacy amonggen pop it's going to get harder and
 harder for them to maintain any kind of claims to authority which issomething i like
 but which does kind of play out in you know certain nefarious ways

Speaker 1 :so people the best of the best are not
 going to want to be politicians

Speaker 0 :yeah because like i could have a job or
 have a job interview and i'm running yahoo or whatever or i could for 18months
 have to eat you know corn dogs looking like i'm going down on someone and shakehands and
 have all this my family and on social media dailycalled the worst things for what and
 then i'm still not guaranteed the position

Speaker 1 :but the flip side of that like from my
 perspective is the competition is weak meaninglike you need a certain a minimum amount
 of eloquence clearly that i don't uh the bar which i did notpass


Speaker 0 :i don't think either of them would be
 considered particularly eloquent biden or trump

Speaker 1 :no i know but that's what i'm saying the
 competition like if if you were um wanted to be become apolitician if you wanted to run for
 president the opportunity is there like if youwere at all competent
 like if you had so like andrew yang is an example of somebody who has a bunchof ideas is somewhat
 uh eloquent like young energetic it feels like there should bethousands of andrew yangs
 like that would enter the domain and he

Speaker 0 :went nowhere


Speaker 1 :well he j well i i wouldn't say he went
 nowhere he generated quite a bit of excitement he just didn't go veryfar that's okay you don't have to run


Speaker 0 :for president to generate excitement
 with your ideas you could be a podcast host i'm not even joking that's right

Speaker 1 :that's right that's right
 and he's both andrew yang oh he's a podcast yeah he has a podcast calledyang speaks


Speaker 0 :no okay cool


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :[Laughter]


Speaker 1 :oh wow the music of the way you said
 yeah cool is the way my mom talks to me when i tell her withsomething exciting going on in my life
 oh that's nice honey oh you made a robot

Speaker 0 :that's cool
 that makes coffee oh you're still single

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :though aren't you


Speaker 1 :ah i wonder why i wonder why make


Speaker 0 :yourself a robot wife
 give me some robot grandchildren um

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :okay but


Speaker 1 :first of all okay let me ask you about
 andrew yanks he represents fresh energy you don't find him fresh orenergetic
 you know like is there any candidate you wishwas um in the mix that was in the mix
 you wish was one of the last two remaining yeah

Speaker 0 :people like marion williamson i thought
 was great uh tulsi i thought was great amyklobuchar got a bad rap
 i think she held her own um smart she wasn't particularly funny and that'sokay
 i think she was not threatening to a lot of people what did you like about them

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :i guess it's named all women that's
 interesting it wasn't even intentional umtulsi i like that she was aggressive has
 a good resume and is not umstaying the course for the establishment
 marion williamson i like because she comes from a placefrom what it seems of genuine compassion
 maybe she's a sociopath i don't know i read her book and it actually affectedme profoundly
 because it's very rare when you read a book and there's even that one idea thatblows your mind
 and that you kind of think about all the time and there was one of that such ideain her book
 about um she was teaching something called the course in miracles inhollywood i think she still teaches it
 and this was during the 80s the high the aids crisisand all these young men in the prime of
 their life were dropping like flies and she's trying to give him hope wellgood luck they're dying no one cares
 and they're like you can't tell us that they're going to cure thislike you're that's a lie and she goes
 what if i told you they're not going to cure it what if itold you it's going to be to like
 diabetes they cut off your foot and you're goingto go blind would that be something that
 you can hope for and when you put it like thatit's like yeah like if you're talking to
 him like a homeless junkie and you're like you could be a doctoryou're a lawyer or a lawyer like cool
 story like you could have a studio apartment with aterrible roommate and a shitty job
 but when you're on the street you know cooking needbreakfast in a teaspoon and you hear
 that you're like wait would that really be so bad is thatreally so much worse than this no and it
 becomes something so when she put it in thoseterms i'm like wow this woman that
 really did a number on me in terms of teachingpeople how to be hopeful
 small steps but it's but it's also then it becomes less ofi need a miracle to be like oh this is
 really magical yeah it's and it's absurd to think it'simpossible


Speaker 1 :what about what's your take on unity
 2020 that brett weinstein uh

Speaker 0 :pushed forward it i i it was doa
 uh he couldn't even stand up to twitter dead on the rival in rival he couldn'teven stand up to twitter let alone or to
 facebook they got blocked let alone

Speaker 1 :hugely problematic by the way that
 twitter would block that

Speaker 0 :not at all um i don't know why they
 blocked it but i believe i don't know problematic means that's aword that does a lot of work
 uh that people wanted to do conceptually umthe idea that like unity is like taking
 the rejects from each party and we're gonna like have something thatno one likes and therefore it's gonna be
 a compromise is absurd the last time we had this kind ofunity ticket was the civil war
 when you had andrew johnson from the democrats and lincoln from therepublicans this was not something that
 ended well uh particularly nicely for both halvesof the country so that that's the way


Speaker 1 :you see it as
 like the way i saw i i guess i haven't looked carefully at it

Speaker 0 :i haven't either to be fair yeah the way


Speaker 1 :i saw it is
 emphasizing centrists which is uh how's

Speaker 0 :celsius centrist
 tulsa was involved yes he's trying to push tulsi and like jesse ventura orsomething


Speaker 1 :oh so oh okay i don't know i don't know


Speaker 0 :the specific as a scientist you also
 know centrism is not a coherent term in politics

Speaker 1 :but see now you're like uh uh
 what is it pleading to authority no i'm

Speaker 0 :treating my ego
 no no i'm pleading to how you approach data if someone is saying the mean isaccurate
 that only mean i mean the mean could be anywhere it's a function of what'saround it doesn't mean it's true


Speaker 1 :i don't even know what uh census is
 supposed to mean but what it means to me there's no idea essentiacentrist there's more of a center right
 or center left to me what that means is somebody who isa liberal or conservative but is
 um open-minded and uh empathetic to the other side

Speaker 0 :joe biden had the crime bill joe biden
 voted for republican supreme court justicesjoe biden voted for a balanced budget
 joe biden voted for bush's war he and i'm sure probably haven't lookedthis up the patriot act yeah if you want
 a centrist you have joe biden yeah okay he's worked very well with therepublicans that argument could be made


Speaker 1 :of course
 they'll everybody will always uh resist that argument

Speaker 0 :you it's undeniable in fact during the
 campaign some uh um uh activistsstarted yelling at him at a town hall
 not yelling just saying hey we need open bordersjoe biden says i'm not for open borders
 go vote for trump and literally turned his back on the manand this is during the primaries where
 it would behoove you to try to appeal to the base and of course you can probably

Speaker 1 :also make the argument that
 donald trump is center right if not center left well

Speaker 0 :i mean he's he's very uh unique as a
 personality right but if you look at his record and his first name is rhetoricyou can say is not centrist at all
 but in terms of how he governs the budgeting i meanhas been very moderate it certainly
 hasn't been like draconian budget cuts uh the supreme court you could say okayhe's hard right
 immigration you could say in certain capacities he's hard right but in termsof
 pro-life what has he done there in terms ofyou know so it's in many other aspects
 he's been very much this kind of me too uhrepublican but certainly the rhetoric
 it's very hard to make in the case that he's a centrist

Speaker 1 :so you don't like uh is there any other
 idea you find compelling like you what i like about unity 2020 is just anidea
 for uh a different way for like a different party a differentpath forward so ideas just like anarchy
 is an interesting idea that's that leads to discourse at leasti don't think it's interesting at all


Speaker 0 :and here's why i think it's interesting
 uh sweden has eight parties in its parliamenticeland population's like 150 000
 they've got nine i think it was czech republic has nine britain has fiveum so the claim that two uh parties is
 the sensorious of speech but three oh now all of a sudden it makes no sensedoesn't import to the data number one
 number two is donald trump demonstrated that you can be basically a third-partycandidate seize the machinery
 of a existing party and appropriate to your own hands as bernie sandersalmost did bernie sanders has never been
 a democrat uh major credit to him for that's not easy to be elected as senatoras an independent he's done it
 repeatedly so these are two examples of ossifiedelites
 uh right for the picking so to have a third party makesuh no real sense speaking of which


Speaker 1 :party you talk about quite a bit uh
 and uh let's look this is a personal challenge to youlet me bring up the libertarian party
 yeah and the personal challenge is to go five minutes without mockingthem
 okay in discussing uh and discussing this idea so first of all

Speaker 0 :what i'm being troubled
 there was an episode where chandler had to not make fun of people like can yougo one day chandler
 and phoebe starts telling him about like this ufo she sawand it's like that's very interesting
 nice for you this is exactly that

Speaker 1 :okay so a true master would be able to
 play within the game within the constraints soum no i i'm pretty sure you'll still
 mock them but no no i'll stick to the

Speaker 0 :rules
 five minutes easy so first of all

Speaker 1 :speaking broadly about libertarianism
 can you speak to that how you feel about itand then also to the libertarian party
 which is the implementation of it in our current

Speaker 0 :system so i think libertarianism is
 a great idea and i think there's many libertarian ideas that have becomemuch more mainstream which i'm very very
 happy about i remember there was an article in either new york or new yorkermagazine in the early 90s
 where they talked about the cato institute which is a libertarian thinktank
 and they referred to the fact that keda was against warand against like regulation with a wacky
 consistency because they didn't know how toreconcile these two things i remember
 what the two things were but i remember that expression wacky consistencyand it wasn't eve we were all taught and
 this is very much before the internet that there's two tribes and if you'repro-life
 you have to hate gays and if you're for socialized medicinethat also means you have to be for uh um
 you know free speech it was just this very and like there's a whole menu andyou got to sign into all of them and
 that menu is terrible they hate america they want to destroy itoh my god those are horrible evil this
 is the menu you want and the libertarian party to some extent andjust libertarian as a whole said
 you know you can do the chinese buffet and take a little from columbia livefrom column b
 and have an ideology that is coherent and consistent analogy ideology of peaceand
 non-aggression and things like that the libertarian partytakes its model from like the early
 progressive and populist parties from the early 20th centurywhich were not very effective in terms
 of getting people elected but were extremely effective in terms ofgetting the two major parties to
 appropriate and adopt their ideas and implement them and in britain as wellthe liberal party got destroyed and
 became taken over by labor as the uh alternative party to the toriesum and have those ideas basically become
 mainstreamed so i think that and deliberate my friend who passed awayeric i miss him dearly
 was their webmaster and his whole point is if you don't think about it in termsof a party in terms of getting people
 elected but if you think of it as a party interms of getting people educated about
 alternatives then there's enormous use for that thatwas his perspective and i don't think
 that's an absurd perspective but here's some libertarianideas that have become extremely
 mainstream war should be a last resort uh this issomething we're taught as kids and we
 all say but for many years it's been like theydon't think of it as the last resort
 it's like something's bad well it's like the firstinstinct now it's like let's really give
 it a week just a week like what's going on in syriais there really gonna be a genocide the
 kurds you know things like that so that's oneanother thing is drug legalization uh
 this was you know when you and i were kids oh it's crazyit's only hippies want to smoke pot
 now it's like with it i was on a grand jury andthe point out people make is are you
 sure that this 16 year old who's sellingwheat let's say selling
 should his life be ruined should he be imprisoned with rapists and murdererslike
 if you say yes say yes but you but are you sure you have to acknowledgethat that's what you're meaning
 and then a lot of people are like wait a minute there's got to be a third optionthen he has no consequences or he's
 imprisoned with the rapist like i'm not comfortable with either of theseuh and i think the other one is an
 increasing skepticism this libertarians were on top of thisfirst and the hard left of the police
 uh as of now asset forfeiture steals more from people than burglaries whatpeople don't know about what that's
 their forfeiture is if the cops come to your house and they suspect you youhaven't been convicted
 of using your car or your house or whatever in terms of selling drugsthey can take whatever they want and
 then you have to sue to prove your innocence and get yourproperty back it's a complete violation
 of due process people don't realize what's going onit's a great way for the cops to
 increase their budgets and it's legal and libertarians were like the first bigones saying guys this is not american
 and this is crazy and now increasingly people onconservatives and left is like wait a
 minute this this is even if you are selling drugs like theytake your house what are you talking
 about so i think those are some uh mechanismsthat libertarianism
 though but not by name has become far more popular

Speaker 1 :yeah it's interesting so the idea yeah
 coherent set of ideas uh that that eventually get integratedinto a two-party system
 yeah the war that's an interesting one you're right i would wanti wonder what the thread there is i
 wonder how it connects to 911 and so on but i i think that i i think

Speaker 0 :the patriot act
 patriot act for people who are politically savvywere like oh okay this is not a joke
 this is really a crazy infringement our freedomsand both parties are falling over each
 other to sign into law and the orwellian name you don't want tohow can you be against patriotism what
 kind of person you know what i mean so that i think fora lot of people especially both civil
 libertarians on the left and a lot of conservatives who areconstitutionalists are like wait a
 minute this isn't i'm not comfortable with this and i'malso not comfortable with how
 comfortable everyone in washington is with it

Speaker 1 :you're right probably libertarian
 libertarians and libertarianism is a place of ideas which is why i havea connection to it like
 i like i i like the every time i listen to those folksi like them i feel connected to them i
 would even sometimes depending on the day call myself a libertarian

Speaker 0 :well we're on the spectrum so that's why


Speaker 1 :we're on the spectrum yeah
 but like when i look at the people that actually rise to the topin terms of like the people who
 represent the party this is where like five minutes ran out

Speaker 0 :right you can i could go i'm allowed you


Speaker 1 :can go why are they so
 weird why aren't strong candidates emerging that representas political like representatives or as
 like uh famous speakers yeahlike that represent the ideology i think


Speaker 0 :libertarians tend to i think jonathan
 height in his book uh in his research he's apolitical scientist and he does a lot of
 things about how people come to their political conclusions andwhat factors uh um force people to reach
 conclusions and he found that libertarians are theleast empathetic and most rationalistic
 of all the groups and by that he means like they think in terms of logic asopposed to like people's feelings and
 and that has positives and has negatives uhit would and we have the a b testing
 with ron paul ron paul ran for president as alibertarian nominee he was the nominee
 he got pretty much nowhere in 1998. then he ran as areturn to republican party as a
 congressman for many years from texas he ran for the presidency in 2008 and2012.
 and in 2008 he stood on stage with rudy giulianiand told him that they were here in 911
 because we're over there which would have been a shockinghorrifying taboo a few years earlier
 many people were like holy crap this is amazing julian was all offended and ronpaul's like
 i took some guts by the way yeah it did

Speaker 1 :i heard that it was so refreshing
 that not what he said but the fact that he said something that took gutsit made me realize how rare it is yes
 for peop for politicians but even people to say something that takes guts well

Speaker 0 :it's also the idea that like
 you can't even if you think america has a rightto invade any country on earth as much
 as it wants and kill people as a consequence of war andblow up their buildings and destroy
 their country you can't with a straight face notexpect us to have
 consequences even if they're consequences from evil peopleeven if we're 100 of the good guys and
 their 100 the bad guys those bad guys some of them are stillgoing to try to do something
 what happens next you know what i mean so that kind of conceptthat there's any american culpability
 was where america where you know we're thegood guys by definition we're not
 culpable to have people start thinking about whatif there's another way
 you know what if we're not there and then they're not here and we'rekind of doing a back door we're talking
 so different scenarios so the fact that he got so much moretraction as a republican
 the fact that donald trump who came out of nowherebecame the not only the candidate but
 the president tells people it's like getting a book deal right youcan either go there's three choices
 you can either self-publish mainstream publisheror independent publisher the
 independent publisher is the worst of all choices because you're not getting abig advance
 they're not going to be able to promote you a lot andthey don't get the distribution
 mainstream i've done mainstream myself right with self i don't have the thecred
 the respectability of a mainstream for the cachet it can't be uh

Speaker 1 :new york times bestseller right let's


Speaker 0 :take six a lot of work
 but i get a lot more of the profit uh if it looks good on the shelf on amazonlooks identical
 so on and so forth with the mainstream the benefits and costs are pretty muchobvious to most people so the same thing
 it's like you can either be an independent like ross perotor you could be just cs won the party
 apparatus which the benefits are enormous therebut in terms of going third party i
 don't know the libertarian party apparatus other than maybe some ballotaccess
 is really that efficacious and then you're gonna have a lot of baggagebecause if you hear independent
 jesse ventura ross perot you think of the personnow you have to define yourself and you
 have to defend the party that's two bridges for most people

Speaker 1 :brilliantly put okay thank you
 uh let me speak to you because i'm i'm speaking to jaron brookesoon yeah uh


Speaker 0 :i like him yeah so but that another


Speaker 1 :example
 i was ask him to tell you a joke about

Speaker 0 :iran
 if he can do it so there

Speaker 1 :that's one criticism i've heard you say
 which is they're unable to speak to any weaknesses in either iran's orobjectivist
 worldview yes that's really uh you you put it i know you're halfjoking but
 that's actually a legitimate discussion to have i'm not i'm not joking at allbecause that's to me one of the
 criticisms and one of the explanations why theworld seems to disrespect ayn rand the
 the people that do is she kind of implies that her ideas are likeflawless


Speaker 0 :she says they correspond to reality yeah
 right that's the term she uses

Speaker 1 :that i mean objective is it's in the
 name it's you know it's just facts likeit's impossible to basically argue
 against because it's pretty simple it's just all facts and that's it's

Speaker 0 :possible to argue against but she would
 say she's never met a good critic who couldargue the facts about misrepresentation
 and she's not entirely wrong she's often caricatured because she has a veryextreme personality and extreme


Speaker 1 :worldview but that to me i mean some
 people there's a guy named in the physics mathematics communitycalled stephen wolf from
 i don't know if you're well from alpha yeah okay he has asimilar style of speaking sometimes
 which is like i've created a science butthat turns a lot of people off like this
 kind of weird confidence but he's one of my favoritepeople i think one of the most brilliant
 people if you just ignore that little bit ofego
 or whatever you call that yeah yeah that there are some beautiful ideas in thereand this amazing person and that for me
 objectivism i'm undereducated about it about it uh i hope to be more educatedbut there's some interesting ideas that
 again just like with ufos uh not that there's a connection with you

Speaker 0 :don't bring that up for your own he
 won't like it i'm runs like ufos oh no no no thisinterview is over


Speaker 1 :that's that's a good yarn okay uh but
 you know you have to be a little bit open-mindedbut what's your sense of of objectivism
 what's uh are there interesting ideas that areuseful
 to you to think about i own her copy of

Speaker 0 :the first printing of the fountainhead
 so that should tell you a little bit about how my affection for miss randhow heavy that goes um i ein rand
 does not have all the answers but she has all the questions so if you studyrand you are going to be forced to think
 through some very basic things and you're going to have your eyes openvery very heavily she was not perfect
 she never claimed to be perfect she was askedon donahue is it true that according to
 your philosophy you're a perfect being she said i never think of myself thatway and she said but if you ask me do i
 practice what i preach the answer is yes resoundingly um she's a fascinatingwoman
 uh what is really interesting about her and this something you'd appreciatepersonally is when you read her essays
 she'll have these weird asides and it looked like she would talk aboutart and she'd be like and this is why
 the u.s should be the only country with nuclear weapons and when you followa brilliant mind making these seemingly
 disparate connections it's something i find to be just absolutely inspiring andawesome and entertaining
 um i think there's lots of things about her that people like yaran would makeuncomfortable um
 well like she they so objectivism like any other philosophy has all thesetechniques to kind of
 hand wave away things you don't want to talk about and like pretend that so theytalk about things like having
 no meta metaphysical significance right so what that means is like well whatabout this i don't talk about it like it
 doesn't matter like it literally means fancyphilosophical terms doesn't matter
 or they will say correctly that it's verytwisted in our culture that when we have
 heroes we look for their flaws instead of looking for their virtues that's a100 valid perspective
 however if i'm sitting here telling you that i think this woman is a badass andshe's amazing
 and she should be studied but there's also these idiosyncrasiesthey don't want to hear it because they
 and i think it's very convenient for them because there's a lot of things shedid
 that work here's an example rand was very very proa happiness and pleasure she was very
 pro-sex which is kind of surprising looking ather and how she talked and how strident
 she was as a result of this she never got hercats fixed to deny them the pleasure of
 orgasm so her male cats are spraying up herentire house yeah
 like that is i mean that's her putting her philosophy into practicebut it's still gross yeah so that's the
 kind of thing where i don't think he'd another thing is randhad an art an article
 on a woman president and she said a woman should never be president rightnow when ran says things that are too
 goofy for them they say oh that's not objectivism that's herpersonal preference it's like
 she did not have these lines objectivism was always defined asein rand's writings plus the additional
 essays in her books so if this was in part of those booksthis counts as official objectivism but
 they pretend otherwise so that's another example plusthey are they she
 was and i bet you she was on the spectrum to some extent i'm not jokingi'm not using that derisively
 she was of the belief and not inaccuratelybecause that humor is used to denigrate
 and humiliate and she was thinking about the jon stewart type before there was ajohn stewart and a lot of times
 like how i use mocking but she was resentfulcorrectly that a lot of times people who
 are great and accomplished little nobodies will make a punch lineuh just to bring them down and just
 bother here's an example i just thought of iremember in i remember when it was must
 be in the 90s they had a segment on mtv of all thesemusicians
 who were making their own perfumes right and this girl grabbed princess perfumeand before she even smelled it she had
 the joke ready she just ugh this smells almost as bad as his musiclately it's like first of all i'm sure
 the perfume's fine yeah and second of all this is princehe's one of the all-time greats and you
 can't wait to you know you know denigrate him likeand part i want to be like brown like
 how dare you like as if as if this perfume in any wayin any way mitigates his amazing
 accomplishments and achievements you horrible person but i do have somegreat iran jokes and he would not be
 happy about them the perfume thing the problem with is

Speaker 1 :just not funny not that
 no he sucks okay great not that they dared to try to be humorous rightbecause i don't know why you mentioned
 jonathan because john stewart's pretty can be funny right but hey he taught a

Speaker 0 :generation you still see this on twitter
 where things have to be inherently sarcasticand snide but isn't that i mean aren't


Speaker 1 :you practicing that no i use irony


Speaker 0 :not sarcasm here's an example when
 people like you say something and someone reply to be like um last ichecked blah blah blah blah and i'll
 that i see i go what do you think saying last i checked added to your pointyou're giving me valuable information
 and data but you are trained to believe that ithas to be couched
 in this sneering it doesn't just give me the information this is usefulinformation


Speaker 1 :that's that's true it's a jerk but see
 john stewart did it masterfully exactly and they don't andthey they don't it's it's like people
 who copy commit certain comedians you try to copy them and you loseeverything in the process of copying
 yeah yeah yep okay uhbut in terms of the the philosophy of
 you know selfishness this kind of individual focused idea and i'm iimagine that connects with you
 yes and i think it would connect with

Speaker 0 :more people they understood what she
 meant by nathaniel brandon who was her heir until she kind of broke with himand and
 he was a co-dedicatee of atlas shrugged saidno one will say on rand's views with a
 straight face they won't say i believe that my happiness matters andis important and it's worth fighting for
 and that ayn rand says this then she's dangerous nowit's very easy to say this could have
 dangerous consequences if you're a sociopathbut to put it in those terms uh i think
 is extremely healthy i think more people should want to be happy and andhave i think a lot of us are raised to
 be apologetic especially in this cynical media culture that if yousay i want to be happy i want to
 love my life that it's just like okay sweetheart and youthe eye rolling and i think that's so
 pernicious is so horrifying and this is why i'm a kamu personbecause camus thought the archenemy was
 cynicism and i could not agree more like if you're the kind of person ifsomeone likes a band and you're like oh
 you like them blah blah it's like this gives them happiness yeah nowthere's certain exceptions but if it
 gives you happiness it's not for you that's cool okay this

Speaker 1 :is beautiful
 i i so agree with you on the eye rolling but you see the best of trolling is notthe eye roll correct of course not the


Speaker 0 :best of trolling
 is taking down the eye rollers i'm gonna

Speaker 1 :have to think about that okay


Speaker 0 :because i haven't red bull


Speaker 1 :yeah uh because i put them all type is


Speaker 0 :red bull


Speaker 1 :um i kind of put them all in the same
 bin okay and they're not they're not they'renot okay all right


Speaker 0 :here's another example of trolling i was
 making jokes about ron paul he just had a strokeright and someone came at me and they're
 like oh blah blah blah you know you're ugly i hope you have astroke i hope you're in the hospital and
 i just go i just did have a stroke on your mom's faceso they came at me yeah and now they got
 put in their place

Speaker 1 :with a subpar um i mean i wasn't clever


Speaker 0 :you weren't you weren't clever not
 particularly no well one of your

Speaker 1 :things you do which is interesting i
 mean i give you props in a sense is you're willing to gofarther than people expect you to yes
 that's fun yeah in fact i'll probably edit out likehalf of this podcast because the the
 thing you did which she kept in i should mention is michaela petersonnow has a podcast which is
 nice i guess was it on her podcast she was at mine she was on yourswe did both but this is when you're


Speaker 0 :referring to when she was on mine she


Speaker 1 :was on yeah right
 and you went right for the

Speaker 0 :for the so i'll tell you what it was you
 don't have to paraphrase so i opened up i sayyou know she's jordan peterson's dad and
 as many people know jordan he's her dad yeah she's had a long issuewith uh substance addiction and i said
 to her you're you know you're most famous forbeing you know jordan peterson's
 daughter you know many people he's changed somany lives around the world he's and
 he's been such an enormous influence to me personally thati've started taking benzodiazepines
 recreationally and she's like oh my god michael is sohorrible


Speaker 1 :yeah you because you pulled me in with
 this because you're talking i mean you knowbecause he's going through a rough time
 now she's going through just everything was just you pulled mein emotionally i was
 like this is going to be the sweet mic is going to be just this wonderfuland then just bam so that's that's
 that's that was uh props to you on that it wasn't whatever that is that is anart form
 uh when done well it can be taken too farmy criticism is it that feels too good
 for some people what do you mean uh for

Speaker 0 :oh they're too happy being irreverent
 because to show that they don't care aboutanything that's another form of cynicism
 though right so i if you because you think it's possible

Speaker 1 :to be a troll and still be the
 live life to its highest ideal in the camus sense

Speaker 0 :i try that's kind of my ideal


Speaker 1 :i i believe it's not i
 it becomes a drug i feel like that takes you like i thinklove ultimately is the way to experience
 like every moment of

Speaker 0 :every day you don't think that was an
 expression of i honestly think let's let's let's splithairs here because i think
 there's something of use here i do think that me i'm me being able to make herlaugh
 about this year of hell she was in yeah does createan element of love and connection
 between me and her yeah but

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :i know she would say that yes it wasn't


Speaker 1 :that
 it was what you said in combination with the sweetness everywhere else thekindness it's a very subtle thing but
 like it's like some of the deepestconnections we have with others is when
 we like mock them lovingly or yes that'scorrect
 but like there is stuff there's kindness around that yeah it'snot in words but in life of course
 subtle things because it creates an

Speaker 0 :error familiarity
 being familial like we're through this together like yeah

Speaker 1 :yeah yeah that's missing that's very
 difficult to do on the internet i agree with youi agree with you that's why my like my
 general approach on the internet is to be uh some morelike simple less witty
 and more like dumbly loving but that's not your core

Speaker 0 :competency being witty


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :uh me yeah but i i could be woody you
 can be but i'm saying that's not your core company so i'm just saying you'rebad at it but i'm saying that's not
 where you go like organically especially withstrangers
 i just feel like nobody's core

Speaker 1 :competence on the internet
 is uh i guess if you want to bring love to the world nobody's core competenceis given the current platforms nobody's
 core competence is whit it's very difficult to be wittyon the internet
 without while still communicating kindness likei'll give you another example in the


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :same way that you can in physical space


Speaker 0 :i'll give you another example someone
 um came at me and they were like they gave me a donationpeople do this all the time and they go
 oh um like i started reading your booksbecause of my wife and you know now
 watch your shows together i keep up the good work and i go what does herboyfriend think
 so that is an example of wit and love becausethat person feels seen i'm acknowledging
 them yeah i'm also making a joke at theirexpense we know it's a joke
 so i think language is often used in non-literal ways to cue emotional andconnectivity
 it's difficult but you it's very

Speaker 1 :difficult what you've done
 is is difficult to accomplish but you've done it well i meanyou do like you did you do been doing
 these live streams which are nice that people give you a bunch of money anddonations and stuff
 and then you you'll often like make fun of certain aspects of their questionsand so yeah but it's so it's always


Speaker 0 :wrong that's not from love that is
 genuine annoyance because they ask me some really dumb questions but they'restill underlying


Speaker 1 :it's not even like there's a kind person
 under this that's being communicated that's interesting buti don't know if i get that from your
 twitter i know i get that from the video thesomething about the face something about
 like yeah of course it's much harder

Speaker 0 :the more the more data yeah the more
 easy it is to convey emotion and subtlety absolutely if youonly have literally black and white
 letters it's gonna be or whatever white and black if you have night modeit's gonna be a very different it's much
 more limited information

Speaker 1 :yeah but this is the fundamental thing
 is like

Speaker 0 :let's here's another example like if
 they had access to my face like a lot of times some people don't know who iam and they come at me call me a nazi
 anti-semite right and i start talking about the jewsand just how terrible the jews are now
 all my audience knows i'm jewish that i went to shiva so they're sitting therelaughing because this person is making
 ass to themselves that person has no idea but if there wasvideo
 then they would be like okay wait a minute something yeah yeah something's

Speaker 1 :up
 i don't know uh i think it's entertaining i think it's funbut i just i don't think it's scalable
 and ultimately i'm trying to figure out this wholetrolling thing because i think it's
 really destructive i've been the outrage mob the outragemobs
 the just the the dynamics of twitter has been really bothering meokay and i've been trying to figure out
 if we can try to build an alternative totwitter perhaps or try to encourage
 twitter to be better how to have nuanced healthyconversations
 like the reason i talk about love isn't just for love's sakeit's just a good base from which to have
 difficult conversations like that's a good starting point because if you startlike i would argue that the kind of
 conversation you have on twitter is fun but it might not be a goodstarting point for a difficult nuanced
 conversation

Speaker 0 :well i'm not interested in having those
 conversations with most people no i know but so i agree with you yourpoint is valid


Speaker 1 :yes but like i'm saying so if we were
 trying to have a difficult nuanced conversation aboutsay race in america
 or policing is there racism institutional racism of policing okaythere's uh
 the only conversations that have been nuanced about it that i've heardis in the podcasting medium which is the
 magic of podcasting which is great but that that's thedownside of podcasting is it's a
 very small number of people even if it's in the thousandsit's still small and then there's
 millions of people on social media and they're not havingnuanced conversation at all they're not
 capable of it

Speaker 0 :that's the difference in you that's
 saved their minds i believe they are so

Speaker 1 :that's there's
 no data that's happening and then both of us aren't being not scientificyou don't have data to support your


Speaker 0 :worldview either you're making the claim


Speaker 1 :well you are too no i'm not if i'm


Speaker 0 :looking at an object
 the free the claim that opens my mind well

Speaker 1 :no what no your claim is that people are
 fundamentally stupid

Speaker 0 :aren't you a martial artist yes
 how does it feel i know you yeah but

Speaker 1 :you really don't think people are deep
 down like capable of being intelligent no not atall


Speaker 0 :not not deep down not surface i'm not
 joking i'm not being tongue-in-cheek and not being cynical i do not at all at allthink they have this capacity


Speaker 1 :i'm gonna because you're just being so
 clear about it you're not even

Speaker 0 :i'm gonna be here you know why i here's
 here's a here's evidence for my position notproof and this is of course data that is
 of little use but it's of interest a lot of times when you have an audienceas big as mine and people come at you
 not only will people say the same thing the same concept they'll say the sameconcept in the same way
 that is not a mind yeah that's surface

Speaker 1 :evidence
 you're saying this iceberg looks like this from the surfaceyeah i'm saying there's an iceberg there
 that if challenged cancan rise to the occasion of deep
 thinking and you're saying nope nope it's just

Speaker 0 :frozen water
 isn't that the russian expression that's ice creamno not doesn't it mean
 like no one's there actually i don't know yeah it means like yeahyeah it's like thought it means


Speaker 1 :okay well uh so you're challenging me to
 be a little bit more rigorous i think i'll try i'll not challenge you

Speaker 0 :anything i'm just saying no not


Speaker 1 :challenging me but like i'm challenging
 myself based on what you're saying because i'd like to prove you wrongand find actual yeah data to show you're
 wrong and i think i can but i would need to uhget that data that's funny you said i


Speaker 0 :think i can when when they were working
 on my biography ego and hubris the title i had suggested was the littleengine that could but shouldn't and
 they didn't like it i think that's a great title it's pretty good yeah

Speaker 1 :speaking of biographies i mean one i
 read your book or listen to your book listen to there's an audiobook for youright yeah i did the audio yeah yeah


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :you you read it my goal is yes okay so


Speaker 1 :this is
 this is uh i didn't do yaron brook's

Speaker 0 :voice in the book i did all the
 different voices because he has lisp and i didn't want to sound like i was makingfun of him


Speaker 1 :yeah i i don't remember you reading it
 but it was i was really enjoyed this yeah no okay it was good itwas like a year a year and a half ago


Speaker 0 :i can't prove


Speaker 1 :uh well let me at a high level see if
 you can pull this off if i ask you uh what's the booknew write about it's about


Speaker 0 :uh a group of people who are united
 solely by their opposition to progressivism who have littleelse in common but who are all
 frequently caricatured and dismissed um bythe larger establishment media


Speaker 1 :but you give this kind of story of how
 it came to be sure and to me like we're talking abouttrolls
 but the internet side of things is quite interestingso first of all how does alt-right
 connect

Speaker 0 :so the alt-right is the subset of the
 new right which feels that race not racism isthe most or one of the most important
 socio-political issues

Speaker 1 :are any of those folks like part of the
 mainstream or worth paying attention to not only by

Speaker 0 :the mainstream
 the alt-right yeah by definition they would be part of the mainstreamthey would not be part of that no they
 would not i don't know that any of them well worth is not aposition i'm not able to say worth
 i'm i would say that it is of use to be familiar with their argumentsbecause to dismiss
 any school of thought especially one that has historicallygained leverage especially one that has
 historically gained leverage in very dark ways especially in america ineurope and other places
 just to say oh they're racist i don't need to think about themit's it's it doesn't behoove you so what


Speaker 1 :uh what lessons do we draw from the
 the 4chan side of things like the internet sideof the movement tits or get the [ __ ] out
 um can you define every single word hits our breasts

Speaker 0 :or get the [ __ ] out that's from 4chan
 okay

Speaker 1 :that's what's uh what's it mean oh
 sometimes like a woman will appear in

Speaker 0 :4chan and they'll just reply tits or get
 the [ __ ] out

Speaker 1 :i'm trying to understand what oh oh
 that's a way i just um very slow uh so that'sokay so that's very disrespectful
 towards female members of the communityi don't understand there's rules to this
 community and one of them is uh we're not very good with women isthat that's one of those


Speaker 0 :sort of principles it's a principle


Speaker 1 :we're not going to ever get laid that's
 the fundamental principle

Speaker 0 :is there we are going to get pics pics
 sometimes

Speaker 1 :sometimes on the sometimes gtfo
 gt okay so is there other actual principlesof so like it's it's
 i from my maybe naive perspective is they have like the darkest aspects oftrolling which is like take nothing
 serious make a game out of everything that's not

Speaker 0 :4chan per se one of the things that you
 will learn 4chan which i think is very healthy isif you have an idiosocratic or unique
 worldview or focus on an aspect of history or cultureyou'll be able to find like-minded
 people who you will engage with you and discuss it without beingpromptly dismissive that's an ideal


Speaker 1 :that they well it's not ideal it's


Speaker 0 :something that happens a lot now 4chan
 is not really like paul as their board with politicsbut they will
 you know get into some like the people there are much more erudite than youthink


Speaker 1 :so they do take my my perception was
 they take nothing seriously so there's things that they take seriously likediscussing ideas i'll give you one


Speaker 0 :example
 there was a video someone posted of a girl who put kittens in a bag and threwin a river
 and they found out where she was within a day and got her like arrestedso yeah they do they take some things
 very seriously

Speaker 1 :okay but that's like an extreme that
 i mean that's good first of all that's heartwarming that they wouldn't somehowturn that into a thing
 that feels like more of uh what is it what's the other one 8chan

Speaker 0 :8 chance twice as good as 4chan yeah
 that's their slogan

Speaker 1 :but it feels like they're the kind of
 community that would take that kitten situation and make a mockery yeahthey're they're a darker than fortune


Speaker 0 :yeah yeah
 i don't even i'm not allowed to talk about 16 chan

Speaker 1 :i'm already overwhelmed clearly uh by
 4chan lingo i'm i have actu i literally wrotedown on my notes
 um like in doing research for this conversationi learned the word pleb and
 i wanted to ask you would this pleb mean

Speaker 0 :you know what flood means no


Speaker 1 :i don't what i i saw i mean actually no
 i don't you know what a pleb is i just i don'tknow what a flub is


Speaker 0 :like a plebiscite or plebeian okay but


Speaker 1 :does it mean something more
 sophisticated um no it's a very

Speaker 0 :unsophisticated mechanism of being
 dismissive

Speaker 1 :of like the regular people yeah or


Speaker 0 :someone who comes at me
 on twitter okay all right so back to

Speaker 1 :the 4chan alt-right it wasn't uh those


Speaker 0 :are very different concepts
 don't conflate them but which

Speaker 1 :internet culture was the alt-right born
 out of

Speaker 0 :uh alright was more born of blogs and
 people had different blogs where they were posting what they called likeracial realism
 scientific which is scientific racism so-called um andyou know breaking down issues from a
 racialist perspective so that wasn't 4chan is much more uh dynamic it's amessage board it's
 very fluid um so it doesn't lend itself to these kind of in-depth analysis ofideas or history


Speaker 1 :but it spreads them like it it spreads


Speaker 0 :them as memes yeah
 and it you know but it's not it's not an

Speaker 1 :essential mechanism of uh
 of the alt-right historical no no no no no no so it was bothmostly about blogs okay so what uh
 what do you make of the psychology of this kind of world viewwhen you have this goes to your


Speaker 0 :conspiracy theory
 subject earlier when you have a little bit of knowledge about somethingabout history that no one's talking
 about and there's only one group that is talking about it and they andyou have no alternative
 answers you're going to be drawn to that group so because issues aboutrace anti-semitism homophobia are so
 taboo in our culture understandably there's good reasons ifyou start putting things like how old
 should you be you have sex with kids just have regularconversations eventually some people are
 going to start taking some positions you don't like so some things have to besanctified to some extent
 they're the only ones talking about it you're going to be drawn to thatsubculture and where does the alt-right


Speaker 1 :stand now
 i mean i hear that term used so the term

Speaker 0 :has been weaponized by the corporate
 press for people that they want to read out ofsociety
 so it's used both on individual levels like people like gavin mckingmckingus milo yiannopoulos some others
 they i mean i think they refer to trump as alt-rightum and and you know it's become a slur
 just like in cell or bot that has become largely removed from its originalmeaning
 do you have a sense that there's still a

Speaker 1 :movement that's all right or like


Speaker 0 :yeah they call themselves now so okay so
 there's something called the dissident rightand they say we're completely not like
 the alt-right because the alt-right's a b and cand we're bcd there's a huge overlap
 it's very much the same people um is there intellectuals that

Speaker 1 :still represent some awesome aspect of
 the movement i mean sure are you tracking this not

Speaker 0 :not that much anymore
 um i think they've they're i don't find it particularlyas um now that the book's done
 you know my i'm looking more into history from my next bookum you mentioned communism i'm going to
 talk a lot about the cold war um so this kind of stuff has largelyfallen away from my radar to some extent
 and they've also been the the it's been a very effectivemovement to get them marginalized and
 silenced

Speaker 1 :so they're not as as deep as of a
 concern in terms of concern or not just their impact on sizemuch less


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :yeah so as a troll on twitter yeah
 in the best sense of the word what do you make uhof canceled culture i think it's maoism


Speaker 0 :it's
 i mean the corporate america has done a far better job of implementing thatwasn't that a communist party
 ever could you had this meeting not that long ago from i think it wasnorthwestern university law school
 where everyone on the call got up and said that they were racist i mean thisis something that legally
 you should be very averse to saying even if it were trueand it's this kind of concept of getting
 up and confessing your sins before the collectiveis something completely um


Speaker 1 :are they sorry they admitted this of
 themselves yeah they were like because

Speaker 0 :they're saying because they're white
 they're inherently racist so my name's john i'm a racist my name is this i'm aracist it was it was uh you hear it and
 you're like okay this is looney tunes

Speaker 1 :so you're saying that wow that's that
 that's so much you took a step further so you're saying there's like aa deep underlying force but
 it says cancer culture it's not just some kind of mobbut it's not some at all it's a


Speaker 0 :it's a systemic organized movement uh
 being used for very nefarious purposes and todominate you know an entire nation


Speaker 1 :how do we fight it because i sense it
 inside you know i used to defend academiaum more because um
 i i still do to some extent it's a nuanced discussionbecause you know like folks like jordan
 peterson and a lot of people that kind of attackacademia they
 refer they really are talking about gender studies at certain departmentsand
 me from mit you know it's the university of science and engineering andthe the faculty there
 really don't think about these issues or haven't traditionally thought aboutit's beginning to even infiltrate there
 it's the you know it's starting to infiltrateengineering and sciences outside of
 biology yeah like let's put biology with the genderstudies like i'm talking about sciences
 that really don't have anything to do with genderuh it's starting to infiltrate
 um and it worries me i don't know exactly why likei don't know exactly what the negative
 effect there would be except it feels like it'santi-intellectual
 oh yes of course and i'm not sure what to uhbecause on the surface
 it feels like a path towards progress at first when you when i'm like zoomedout you know just like
 like squinting my eyes the you know not even in detail looking at things butwhen i actually joined the conversation
 to like listen in the conversation on quote-unquotediversity
 it quickly makes me realize that there's no interest in umin making a better world no no it's
 about domination

Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :it's it's about getting yeah it's a way


Speaker 0 :for
 if you are a lowest status white person using anti-racism is the only mechanismyou will have to feel superior to
 another human being so it's very useful for them um in termsof
 fighting it one of my suggestions has been to seize all university endowmentswhich are the crystallization of
 privilege and distribute that money as reparationsso be very effective by turning two
 populations against each other and strongly diminishing theuniversity's intellectual hegemony
 uh the universities are absolutely the real villains in the picture thankfullythey're also the
 least prepared to be aggressed upon and after thegovernment and the corporate press they
 are the last leg of the stool and they don't know what's coming andit's gonna get ugly and i cannot wait


Speaker 1 :so this is where you and i disagree part
 one yeah we disagree in a sense that you want to dismantlebroken institutions i don't think
 they're broke

Speaker 0 :they're working like by design i think
 for over 100 years they have been talking about bringingthe next generation of american leaders
 which is code for promulgating an ideologybased on egalitarian principles and
 world domination let me try to express

Speaker 1 :my lived experience okay sure okay
 my experience at mit is that there's a bunch of administrators thatare the bureaucracy
 sure that i can i can say this is the nice thing about having apodcast i don't give a damn is they're
 pretty useless in fact they get in the way but there'sfaculty there's professors
 that aren't incredible they're incredible human beingsthat all they do all day they're
 too busy but for the most part what they do all dayis just like continually pursue
 different little trajectories of curiosities in the inthe various
 avenues of science that they work on and as a side effect of that they mentora group of students sometimes a large
 group of students and also teach courses and they're constantly sharing theirpassion with others and
 my experience is it's just a bunch of people who are curious aboutengineering and math and science
 chemistry artificial intelligence computer science what i'm most familiarwith
 and there's never this feeling of mit being broken somehow like this kind offeeling like if i talk to you just now
 or like eric weinstein there's a feeling likestuff is on fire right there's something
 broken uh but when i'm in in the system uh especially before the kovid beforethis kind of tension
 everything was great there was no discussion ofeven diversity all that kind of stuff
 the the toxic stuff that we might be talking about right nownone of that was happening it was a
 bunch of people just in love with uh cool ideasexploring ideas being curious and
 learning and all that kind of stuff so i don't my my sense of academiawas this is the place where kids in
 their 20s 30s and 40s can continue the playground of science and having funit's
 if you destroy academia if you destroy universities likeyou're suggesting kind of lessening
 their power you take away the playground from thesekids to to


Speaker 0 :to play it's going to be hard for you to
 tell me that i'm anti-playground yeah well i guess i'm saying you're on

Speaker 1 :top certain kinds of playgrounds which
 is yeah the ones that have the broken glass

Speaker 0 :on the floor yeah i am against those
 kinds of playgrounds

Speaker 1 :no no you're you're you're


Speaker 0 :yes no you see that you listen


Speaker 1 :no you no you wait yeah i i i would say
 you're being the watchful mother who the one kid whohurt themselves in the glass


Speaker 0 :one kid it's an intelligent it's
 generation after generation i'm not a watchful mother i'm the guy with theflamethrower


Speaker 1 :no i i i understand that but you're
 using the one kid who was always kind of like weird umgender studies department uh that that
 hurt themselves on the glass as opposed to the people who are likeobviously having fun in the playground
 and not uh playing by the glass the broken glass and they're justi mean to me some of the best
 innovations in science happen in universities okay you can't forgetthat universities don't have this
 liberal like politics literally inevery conversation until this year until
 this this year there's something happeningbut uh every conversation i've ever had
 nothing to do with politics would never trump never came upnone of that ever come up nothing like
 all this kind of idea that there's liberalall that that that's in the humanities


Speaker 0 :yeah but do you think mit massachusetts
 into technology might be a little bit of an outlier yeahthere probably is yeah


Speaker 1 :but i i don't i honestly don't think
 when people criticize academia they're looking atuh they're in fact also picking the
 outliers which is they're picking some of thequote unquote's strongest gender studies
 department this is nonsensical when i

Speaker 0 :was a bucknell
 i was a college student we had to take you know we had a bunch of electives andi want to take a class on individual
 american individualism one of the texts of the fivethat we had to read was birth of a
 nation the movie about the clan so there'sno department where these people
 are not thorough going hardcore ideologues uh this is not a gendercities that's the humanity
 fine all the humanity it's not just gender studies okay fine

Speaker 1 :i can give you history english yes all


Speaker 0 :of them
 every university as you know has it mandatoryin the curriculum they have to take a
 bunch of these propaganda classes

Speaker 1 :i look forward to youtube comments
 because you're being more eloquent and you're speaking to the thing that alot of people agree with and i'm being
 my usual slow self and people are going to say not very nice thingsabout me don't say anything that nice


Speaker 0 :about lex okay
 please let me try to just just shoot up

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :a school
 that would be preferable there he goes

Speaker 1 :again only the teachers go to the
 darkest possible place the sunshine baby schools that's where

Speaker 0 :everyone goes to be happy playgrounds


Speaker 1 :there he goes dark ear just
 dives right in like it just go dark and then just comes back off to the surface

Speaker 0 :not to feel
 [Laughter]

Speaker 1 :um you're probably a figment of my
 generation i'm not even having this podcast well after 18 red bulls i'm

Speaker 0 :surprised you could see anything
 this is like fight club red bull gives

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :you delirious yeah
 uh i got into it at norton yesterday on twitter oh really yeah as he uh like the

Speaker 1 :rest of the celebrities yeah he's like


Speaker 0 :oh this is an existential threat to
 america trump's a fascist he's delegitimizing the oval office i saidwhat an odd endorsement of trump


Speaker 1 :well you should have went with bad pit
 he might have a different opinion that's spikereference okay this conversation


Speaker 0 :is over it's interesting i'd like to


Speaker 1 :draw a line between science and
 engineering and science not including like thebiological
 aspect the the parts of biology that touchand humanities and biology like i feel
 because uh humanities if you just look at thepercentage of universities it's still
 a minority percentage and i would actually draw differenti think they serve very different
 purposes sure and that's actually a broken part aboutuniversities about like
 why why is some of the best research in the world done at universities thatdoesn't
 like there might be a different like mit it feels weird that a faculty yeah these

Speaker 0 :are conceptually different things like
 we do research and we teach why is this the same yeah it feels weird but that's

Speaker 1 :just but but i'm also i'm coming to like
 the defense of the engineers that never talk abouti'm not like
 like my mind isn't i'm not like deluded or something where i'm i'm not seeingthe
 the house on fire i'm just saying i am seeing the house because i also lived inharvard square i'm seeing harvard
 but when you see the tanks coming

Speaker 0 :they're coming next
 they're gonna be so beautiful i'm gonna it'll be like theamerican beauty the plastic bag i just
 won't be able to stop crying because it'll be so beautiful yeah

Speaker 1 :thanks i could i can already i can
 already see it but the but the engineering departments werelike i believe
 that the elon musks of the world that thethe like the innovation that will make a
 better world is happening and like let's not burnthat down
 because it has nothing to do with any like they're all likesitting quietly in while like well
 the the humanities and all these kind of diversity programs they're not havingany of these discussions


Speaker 0 :listen my soviet brother you both know
 we both know that ice water runs in our veinsso if you're calling for mercy that is
 not how i'm wired but i'm not closing the door yeah i'm

Speaker 1 :actually realizing now
 so for people listening to this i'll probably prepend this and saying thati'm even slower than usual i didn't
 sleep last night but i feel i'm actually realizing justhow slow i
 am and how much preparation i need to do inif i would like to defend aspects of
 academia i better come prepared i don't think you

Speaker 0 :need to defend them i think i'm
 granting you your premise freely no you might be

Speaker 1 :okay i don't think the the world is that


Speaker 0 :like actually you just defeat your own
 argument because you because it is not at allhave to be the way that a phenomenal
 research institution like mit which no onedisputes has to also be an educational
 establishment these two things are not at allnecessarily interconnected but then you
 have to offer a way

Speaker 1 :to separate correct but like i'm not a
 big fan everybody's different but i'm not a fanof criticizing institutions without
 offering sure a way to change and especially when i'm likehave ability to change i'd like to yeah
 i'd like to offer a path like what if they were in students they

Speaker 0 :were all mentor like uh like men like
 um what's the opposite of a mentor menteeprotege what's the term when you're like
 just when you work at a place like interns not an intern something i'mthinking of but anyway like basically
 they're working there instead of going to college there it's possible but

Speaker 1 :it's going against tradition and so you
 have to build new institutions and uh and then have these engineers

Speaker 0 :building new things that's crazy
 yeah these research engineers where they're going to be buildingthings well one of the things because


Speaker 1 :you're kind of
 you know apprentice that's the way i was

Speaker 0 :looking at apprentice which is ironic
 we're talking about trump and we couldn't think of the word apprenticeah very yeah well done


Speaker 1 :we should both be fired yeah there you


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :go
 these russian jews so quick with their wit okayuh but the the thing is you're a fan of
 freedom i am and there's there is uh intellectualfreedom
 people this is what i was trying to articulate i'm failing to articulatebut there truly is complete intellectual
 freedom within universities on topics of science andengineering i believe you


Speaker 0 :yeah i agree with you i don't think it's
 going to take much persuasion but i'll give you an examplewhen that i i'm sure you know more
 details about this than i do when that uh scientistengineered that probe to land on that
 comet and the articles written because thishawaiian shirt he was wearing had like
 pinup girls on it which i think is femalestudent episode frame or something
 where's his ex-girlfriend and he had to apologizethis is what rand was talking about yeah
 that the great accomplishments of men have to say i'msorry
 to the lowest most despicable disgusting people

Speaker 1 :yeah i don't know you know let me bring
 this case up because i think about this uh this might not mean much to you butit means a lot to a certain
 aspect of the computer science community there's a guy named richard stallmani don't know if you know who that is no
 he's the founder of the free software foundation he's like a biglinux he's one of the key people in the
 history of computer science one of those open source people rightbut he is like
 i believe he's the one of the hardcore ones which is like soall software should be free okay okay so
 very interesting personality very key person in the new just like linustorvald key person
 so but he also kind of speaks his mind okay and on a certain chain ofconversations
 at mit that was leaked to the new york times then was publishedled him to be fired or pushed out of mit
 recently maybe a year ago and i always sat weird with me so whathappened is um
 there's a few undergraduate students thatcalled marvin minsky not sure if you're
 familiar who that is i've heard the name he's one of the seminal people inartificial intelligence
 they they said that they called him a rapistbecause uh he met with jeffrey epstein
 and jeff uh free epstein solicited uh two these are the best facts known tome that i'm aware of that's what was
 stated on the chain is he solicited a 17 but it might have been an 18 year oldgirl to come up to marvin minsky
 and ask him if he wanted to have sex with herso jeffrey epstein told the girl yeah
 she came up to marvin miske who was at that time is i think seven years oldand his wife was there too marvin mink's
 wife and he said no or like you know awkwardly yeah sothank you
 yeah no thanks and that was stated in the email threadas marvin participating in
 uh sexual assault and rape of this uh unwilling sexual assault and it wascalled rape
 uh of this person right of this woman that propositioned him and thenrichard stallman who's he's kind of
 known for this he's very he's you make fun of me beinga robot but he's kind of like a debugger
 he's like well that sentence is not what you said is not correctso he like corrected the person uh
 basically made it seem like the the use of the word rape is not correctbecause that's not the definition of
 rape and then he was attacked for saying ohnow you're playing with definitions of
 rape rapist rape is the answer right and then that wasleaked
 in him defending so the way he was leaked it wasreported as him defending
 um rape that's the way it was reported and he was pushed out and he didn'treally give a damn
 it's he doesn't seem to make a big deal out of it he just left he made anexample of him


Speaker 0 :

Speaker 1 :they made an example and that and
 everyone was afraid to defend him so like there's a bunch of faculty onedude you're from the soviet union


Speaker 0 :doesn't this
 hit close to home for you i don't know

Speaker 1 :what to think of it it hits
 close to home but it was basically at least at mitnow mit is such a light place with this
 it's not common at mit but it was like 18 19 year old kidsundergraduate kids with this kind of
 fire in them there's just very few of thembut they're the ones that raise all this
 kind of fuss and the entirety of the administrationall the faculty are afraid to stand up
 to them it's so interesting to me like i don'tknow if i should be afraid of that


Speaker 0 :you don't think you should be afraid so
 someone who's trying to be specific when it comes to charges of violent assaultis looking for that clarity can get
 their life uh other search engines let me give you more context

Speaker 1 :there's a little bit more context to
 richard stallman which is he was also a rapist

Speaker 0 :no he left out that part he liked raping
 people but he's had a history

Speaker 1 :through his life uh of
 you know every once in a while wearing the hawaiian shirt with like he wouldmake
 he's a fat uh sorry but he's a fat unattractive he like what trump referredto the the yeah


Speaker 0 :the guy in the basement in the basement
 that's richard

Speaker 1 :okay i love you is is you know he is
 what he is peop you know people he like he wouldeat his own uh
 he would pick skin from his feet and lectures and just eat itokay yeah this video is him doing that


Speaker 0 :i'm not joking he must really behind the
 spectrum then yeah okay yeah and

Speaker 1 :so and you know uh he i think
 this uh and his office he adore he wrote something like uhuh like hacker
 uh plus plus lover of ladies or something like that likesomething kind of yeah yeah yeah so


Speaker 0 :professional
 yeah unprofessional and a little creepy

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :yeah no that's fair
 so he was also so they're looking for an excuse to get rid of himit sounds like i know he was just


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :who's they the administration yeah


Speaker 1 :probably
 probably a lot of times what people

Speaker 0 :don't realize you know this would be my
 defensive cancer culture a lot of times when someone gets firedover something like this yeah this isn't
 why this is just giving them cover to get rid of them without getting alawsuit yeah but it's still


Speaker 1 :so i think i guess what i'm trying to
 communicate it feels a little weird and creepyand he may not be the the best for the
 community but that's not necessarily the messageit's sent to the rest of the community
 the message is sent to the rest of the community thatbeing clear about words or the usage of
 the word rape is uh like you should call everythingrape that's
 that's that's basically the message you send or you should call that we say rape

Speaker 0 :rape
 it's about submission i think i'm you'd be very happy to know that there's a lotof people and she's very crucified this
 like betsy devos the president's department of educationwho are aware of this
 they are aware that this completely contradicts due process uh they're awareof how
 a rape accusation is something not to be taken seriously but because it's not tobe taken seriously it has to be also
 taken seriously another context that you know once that word is around amale this can ruin his entire life
 um and that's that that's the sticky

Speaker 1 :thing of the word
 like i like i think about this a lot that umlike how would i defend it if somebody
 like i've never i can honestly say i've never doneanything close to creepy in my life
 like uh with like with women but you wouldn't know it if you had right

Speaker 0 :that's the thing a lot of these creepy
 guys don't think they're creepy they think they're being cute

Speaker 1 :yeah but i'm just telling you even like
 fine let's say right let's say i'm not aware of it but the point thati am aware of is that somebody could
 just completely make something up correct yeah

Speaker 0 :yeah yeah yeah okay and like how what do


Speaker 1 :what would i say no


Speaker 0 :he denied the charges there's an article
 around everything you did supposedly and then goesuh mr freeman denied the charges yeah
 but what creeps me out that happened can i interrupt there iszora neal hurston is one of my favorite
 writers she's from the harlem renaissanceum she wrote their eyes were watching
 god a couple of other books she was just an amazing amazing figureher biography is called um wrapped in
 rainbows it's just a masterpiece i like i think i read it one daycan't recommend her enough fascinating
 fascinating woman during the 30s i think it was her 1940 she was outof the country
 she was accused of molesting a teenage boyshe wasn't in america this could be
 proven so there's is absolutely false not evena question she was indicted
 and she wanted to kill herself because she's likepeople are going to see these things and
 they're going to think maybe there's some truth to it maybe it's voluntarywhat they're just going to and and you
 could understand what should be suicidal over thisso yeah this is this is something that's
 been going on for a long time and in the fact that it's becoming i do agreeit's important i know a lot of women
 who have been sexually assaulted more than i i'm happy that i knowand if i know that many that means
 there's more so i i don't i think it's it's a good idea that theyfeel seen
 that they don't feel wounded they don't feel damaged or they can talk to theirfriends and
 i'm like man this sucks is happening to you and and i don't think you're a [ __ ]i don't think you're asking for it i
 think you feel violated i think it's grosstalk to me like i i do think that that's
 important and i also think it's important though like when things getkind of in a frenzy that a lot of people
 like yeah i also had something happen and veryquickly the line between he grabbed my
 boob and he violently raped me i don't thinkthese two things are the same at all i
 think they're both sexual assault but in terms of what someone can dealwith the next day the next month 10
 years later i i don't think there's similarscenarios
 yeah i had juanita broderick on my show and hearing her talk aboutyou know her alleged rape by bill
 clinton was very disturbing for me verydisturbing to hear
 because it was like half an hour so you know we think of these things and thinkokay
 hold her down blah blah yeah and then it's done half an hour when just evensomeone physically holding you down for
 half an hour like not even a sexual assault yeah like that's traumaticyeah you think am i your brain's gonna
 think am i gonna die when i zoom out

Speaker 1 :i think the ultimately this is gonna
 lead to a better world like empowering women to speak tothose kinds of experiences the benefit
 of it outweighs the the issue is whenever people are

Speaker 0 :given a weapon
 some are going to use it in nefarious ways and that's the lesson of historymales when males females whites blacks
 children adults when people are given a mechanism toexecute power over others
 some are going to use it can i ask you

Speaker 1 :for a therapy thing
 um sure untrolling in a sense uh because i mentionedsomebody making up something about me
 i feel because i wear my heart on my sleevei'm not good with these attacks like
 i've been attacked recently just being called a fraud and all thatkind of stuff just light stuff like i
 haven't you know it was like it hurt okay well

Speaker 0 :let me help you maybe it's because i'm a
 new yorker no i'm serious here's why in new yorka lot of times you'll be walking with
 your friend and a homeless person will come up to you and start yellingthings at you your reaction
 isn't in those circumstances let me hear this outyour reaction is physical safety and
 getting away now it's not impossible that thathomeless person
 is actually saying the truth this happened to my a friend of mine shethis guy wasn't homeless um and he's
 walking down the street on smith street and he's just talking out loud and hegoes why they call them hipsters what
 are they hip to and she chuckles and he goes what areyou laughing at fatso
 you start something i'll finish it yeah and she she just couldn't move

Speaker 1 :yeah and it's like it's made a problem


Speaker 0 :because that's the first thing he went
 to and there's i don't know that i have anyadvice
 but when you hear something like this this is i think you need to be better interms of boundaries
 i think you should not perceive this as a fellow human but asa crazy homeless person because
 if this fellow human if i thought that you werea fraud in some context that's a very
 weird word to use because fraudulent podcasterthese are real mics but if i was a
 scientist or

Speaker 1 :human sure but i would ask myself is


Speaker 0 :this person
 in a position to make this judgment or are they backing it upare they saying here your conclusions
 were wrong here's some mistakes in your dataand you can engage with them on ideas
 but whenever someone uses a word to entirely dismiss your lifewithout having the knowledge of your
 life you do not have to take that seriously

Speaker 1 :i appreciate that kind of idea but
 some things aren't about data like you know i i see myself as a fraud oftenand it's it's more psychology of it
 um if i can reduce something to reason i can probably be fine my worry is thesame as the worry of uh like teenage
 girls that get bullied online it's like when i'm being open andfragile on the internet
 it affects me in a way where i can't the reason doesn't help soit helps me you don't block people


Speaker 0 :enough i'm very happy with the blocking
 no i

Speaker 1 :so yeah i'm very heavy i block i


Speaker 0 :it's healthy progressive banality i
 block immediately i also think time is going to help idon't think you're
 like you didn't grow up wanting to be a podcaster right that wasn't youraspiration
 so in some sense you are going to feel like a fraud because you're like what idon't have any training for this i have
 a training for a scientist i can talk about artificial intelligencefor literally hours but in terms of this
 like i don't know what i'm doing i'm kind ofso when they call you a fake it's like
 yeah you're kind of right because like i i did kind of stumble into this and thisis not my pedigree
 so i think that kind of probably speaks to you on some level well but they'rethey're attacking not the podcasting


Speaker 1 :thing but more like the same
 thing people call elon musk fraud too which guy that that's the way irationalize it like
 well if they're calling him a fraud and they're calling me a fraudthat like even if you have rockets that
 go into like if you successfully have rockets uhlanding back on earth usable rockets
 you're still being called a fraud then it's okay not necessarily it could

Speaker 0 :be that he's not a fraud you really are
 that's but it's not resonating with you because your brain knows the logic soyou can right


Speaker 1 :but uh yeah yeah
 but i don't know this whole trolling thing you seem to bemuch better at
 seeing it as a game you know why because

Speaker 0 :you
 are under the delusion that every human being is capable of intelligent reasoneddecisions still think i'm right and i
 perceive them as literally animals so when a dogstarts barking
 all it's saying is that the dog is agitated and this is not going to changemy life one iota other than crossing the
 street perhaps yeah i'm going to prove you wrong one

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :day if you're going to kill yourself


Speaker 1 :but if i don't i'll prove you wrong okay
 i'll bring the data and they'd be like you're right i have

Speaker 0 :the receipt i have the receipts


Speaker 1 :okay so we mentioned camus oh yeah i
 love him is there um this is this is this is aquestion that people
 like love when i ask of really smart peoplewell it is love no
 uh what uh what books let's say three books if you can uh think of themtechnical fiction philosophical would
 you uh had a big impact on you or would yourecommend to others sure


Speaker 0 :uh the machiavellians by james burnham
 uh this is a book about how politics works in reality as opposed to howpeople
 imagine it working um mentis moldbug who's a figure in these circles who'srespected by a lot of people
 i was giving a talk and there was a bunch of panelists andwe were asked what book would you
 recommend i said the machiavellians independently of me that was the book hehad recommended it's out of print it's
 hard to find but that would be one is that his book or no james burnham1941 i think
 so uh can you pause on the mulches

Speaker 1 :what's that it's just a small bug


Speaker 0 :that's a code name right like that guy


Speaker 1 :named that guy's dependent curtis jarvin


Speaker 0 :it's his real name he's in he swims in
 your circles which he doesn't kind of progress he's

Speaker 1 :originally programmed yeah
 he comes up as a person that i should talk with or i should know about butthen i read a few of his things and they
 seem quite dangerous

Speaker 0 :they're very long and verbose but i
 think he's an amazing thinker yeah but he's the one who had the ideaof sending the tanks to harvard yard


Speaker 1 :but doesn't he have like uh
 he has some radical view i forget what they are very radical views yeah he

Speaker 0 :wants a military
 coup but you're saying he's a serious

Speaker 1 :thinker this
 is worthy uh of not worthy i don't know that you would enjoy having

Speaker 0 :a conversation with him i think a lot of
 people enjoy seeing it happen but i think it'd be a lot of talking past eachother
 and and it would be interesting what do youdo okay um what do you agree what do you


Speaker 1 :disagree i


Speaker 0 :agree with him that politics has to be
 looked at objectively and without kind of an emotional umconnection
 to different schools i talk about him a lot in my book on the new rightum disagree i don't think a military
 coup is a good idea uh he's he doesn't thinkanarchism is stable i disagree
 um i mean me and him i did his live stream with him we just dorked out a lotabout history and like you know people
 who've fallen in the memory hall so i mean he'sgot a lot of writing
 so so you know the sense i got from him

Speaker 1 :was that if i talk with him a lot of
 people would be upset with me for giving him a platform

Speaker 0 :yeah i think he's on that edge where
 they want to read him out of what is acceptable discourse what's his

Speaker 1 :most controversial
 i mean you can mention the tanks is that the most controversial viewpointdoes he have a race thing no he's the


Speaker 0 :the alt-right doesn't particularly like
 him in many ways because he's not a big on the race thing i don't know whatwould be his most controversial view
 uh uh to be honest i think because he is radical in terms of his analysis ofculture anytime someone's a radical that
 is dangerous because it's dangerous

Speaker 1 :okay book uh so that's one the headlines


Speaker 0 :ahead which is a um i would say that


Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :shrug no if and if you read atlas shrug
 before reading the fountain head you're doing yourself an enormous disservicedon't you dare do it


Speaker 1 :on the philosophical because every novel
 every every level

Speaker 0 :fountain head's a better novel
 fountainhead's superfluous if you read out the shrug firstfountain heads about psychology and
 ethics uh it does not have to do with herpolitics other than its implications
 so it's by far the superior book um the third oneoh this is a good one question let me
 see what i there's so many good books out there that i lovei i'm going to this is not really my
 third choice but i'll throw it out there because ium this is such an important world view
 especially people on the right are you virtue signaling no this is

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :counter signaling
 um thaddeus russell's book a renegade history of the united stateshis thesis is that it's the degenerates
 that give us all freedom um and things like prostitutes things likemadams things like slaves
 things like immigrants because they were solow status they could get away with
 things that then people who are higher status demanded and so on and so forthso i think that thesis
 and it really has extreme um consequences inuh thinking and no john jonathan height
 the righteous mind that's those are the four is that his

Speaker 1 :best i haven't read
 any of his stuff okay that was four but of course forget thatwe'll put


Speaker 0 :we'll put height in there you would uh
 no forget that is this those are the three

Speaker 1 :so we talked about love let me ask you
 the other question i'm obsessed with are you uhdo you ponder your own mortality i do


Speaker 0 :a lot especially now that i'm an uncle
 especially now that i have like these youngerpeople that i mentor um i was just
 yesterday uh my friend john gergis who did my theme song for my podcast who didthe
 book cover for um dear reader who's like the most talented person i know hissong came on the ipod at the gym
 and i almost messaged him i go you know one day one of us is going to bury theother and it's going to be really sad
 and i thought about that and it was kind of like oh man that's really going tosuck
 um and you know i don't know which scenario would be better like i will bevery just sad if he's gone i'm sure
 he'll be very sad if i'm gone um i mean what are you are you afraid of

Speaker 1 :it no


Speaker 0 :uh you know uh um rand had this quote
 about how uh i won't die the world will end soi've had enough experiences that i am i
 i've really at this point and everything'sicing on that cake
 so if you if i were to kill you at the

Speaker 1 :end of this podcast
 it would feel painless that would be okay yeahyou know why does anyone know you're
 here by the way

Speaker 0 :you know why i'll ask you for a friend
 here's why there's that wit say that for twitterlikes
 did they call you sasha no i'm uh no

Speaker 1 :sure


Speaker 0 :oh that's my sister's husband okay so
 here's why i strongly believe and this is a very kind of jewishperspective that you just have to
 leave the world a little bit better than you found it that all you could do ismove the needle a little
 and one of the things i set out to do with dear reader my book on north koreai said i was at a point in my career
 where i could do something to make a difference instead of just writing likeco-authoring books with celebrities
 which i'm very proud of but you know are neither here nor thereand i thought all right i know how to
 tell stories i know how to inform people and 110 peopleif i move the needle in america who
 cares we got it really good here if i move the needle in north korea alittle bit the cost benefits through the
 roof

Speaker 1 :i never thought of that actually i never
 thought of d reader from that perspectiveso when i set out to write it i'm like


Speaker 0 :okay
 what can i do i'm not gonna be able to liberate the north korean regime what ican do is the camera right now is
 focused on at the time kim jong-il now kim jong-unand i can do just this just this a
 little bit and i go behind that guy who you think is funny clown there'smillions of dead people
 about north korea in terms of look at those silly buffoons tothose poor people so the fact that that
 little thing i can say with a straight face i diddoesn't make me a great person
 but it does make me someone who if i have to go tomorrowi can say i did a little bit to make the
 world a better place

Speaker 1 :what do you think is the meaning of life


Speaker 0 :i think the meaning of life is
 um why are we here oh well that i'm a

Speaker 1 :

Speaker 0 :camus person
 so i'll give the kamu answer so there's two types of peoplethose who know how to use binary no


Speaker 1 :thanks thanks for relating to the
 audience one zero zero one two two

Speaker 0 :[Laughter]
 down vote what kind of radical freak is this lexso and i use this example of my
 forthcoming book you go into a countryside a mountainsideand you see a blank canvas
 on an easel and one kind of mentality goes this isit's just a blank canvas this is stupid
 this is what am i looking at and the other type goes what a greatopportunity
 i'm in this beautiful space i have this entire canvas to paint i could doanything i want with it
 so i am very much of that type 2 person and i i hope others start tothink of life in that way you and i have
 both been more successful than we expected to especially growing upand in ways we did not expect and when
 you're young you are so intent on driving the car andafter a certain point you realize it's
 not about driving the cars you're being a surferthat you can only control this little
 board and you have no idea where the waves will take you and sometimes you'regonna fall down and something's gonna
 suck and you're gonna swallow some salt water but at a certain point you stoptrying to drive
 and you're like this is freaking awesome and i have no idea where it's going togo


Speaker 1 :beautifully put i know i speak for a lot
 of people first of all everyone loves the gameyou play on the internet it's fun you
