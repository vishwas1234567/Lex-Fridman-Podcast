 the following is a conversation with Marcus hunter senior research scientists the google deepmind throughout his career of research including with Juergen Smith Huber and Shayne leg he has proposed a lot of interesting ideas in and around the field of artificial general intelligence including the development of IHC spelled a ixi model which is a mathematical approach to AGI that incorporates ideas of Kolmogorov complexity solomonoff induction and reinforcement learning in 2006 Marcus launched the 50,000 euro hütter prize for lossless compression of human knowledge the idea behind this prize is that the ability to compress well is closely related to intelligence this to me is a profound idea specifically if you can compress the first 100 megabytes or 1 gigabyte of Wikipedia better than your predecessors your compressor likely has to also be smarter the intention of this prize is to encourage the development of intelligent compressors as a path to AGI in conjunction with this podcast release just a few days ago Markus announced the 10x increase in several aspects of the surprise including the money to 500,000 euros the better your compressor works relative to the previous winners the higher fraction of that prize money is awarded to you you can learn more about it if you Google simply Qatar prize I have a big fan of benchmarks for developing AI systems and the harder prize may indeed be one that will spark some good ideas for approaches that will make progress on the path of developing a GI systems this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on

STEM education for young people around the world and now here's my conversation with Markus cutter as a computer or maybe an information processing system let's go with a big question first okay I with a big question first yeah I think it's very interesting hypothesis or idea and I have a background in physics so I know a little bit about physical theories the standard model of particle physics and general relativity theory and they are amazing and describe virtually everything in the universe and they're all in a sense computable theories I mean they're very hard to compute and you know it's very elegant simple theories which describe virtually everything in the universe so there's a strong indication that somehow the universe is computable but it's a plausible hypothesis so what what do you think just like you said general relativity quantum field theory what do you think that the laws of physics are so nice and beautiful and simple and compressible do you think our universe was designed is naturally this way are we just focusing on the parts that are especially compressible our human minds just enjoy something about that simplicity and in fact there's other things that are not so compressible no I strongly believe and I'm pretty convinced that the universe is inherently beautiful elegant and simple and described by these equations and we're not just picking that I mean if the versatile phenomena which cannot be need to describe scientists would try that right and you know there's biology which is more messy but we understand that it's an emergent phenomena and you know it's complex systems but they still follow the same rules right of quantum electrodynamics and all of chemistry follows that and we know that I mean we cannot compute everything because we have limited computational resources now I think it's not a bias of the humans but it's objectively simple I mean of course you never know you know maybe there's some corners very far out in the universe or super super tiny below the nucleus of atoms or well parallel universes where which are not nice and simple but there's no evidence for that and you should apply Occam's razor and you know just the simple story consistent with but also it's a little bit for friendship so maybe a quick pause what is Occam's razor so or comes razor says that you should not multiply entities beyond necessity which sort of if you translate it to proper English means and and you know in a scientific context means that if you have two series or hypotheses or models which equally well describe the phenomenon your study or the data you should choose the more simple one so that's just the principle you're sort of that's not like a provable law perhaps perhaps we'll kind of discuss it and think about it but what's the intuition of why the simpler answer is the one that is likely to be more correct descriptor of whatever we're talking about I believe that Occam's razor is probably the most important principle in science I mean of course we logically Duck shouldn't be do experimental design but science is about finding understanding the world finding models of the world and we can come up with crazy complex models which you know explain everything but predict nothing but the simple model seem to have predictive power and it's a valid question why yeah and the two answers to that you can just accept it that is the principle of science and we use this principle and it seems to be successful we don't know why but it just happens to be or you can try you know find another principle which explains or comes razor and if we start with the assumption that the world is governed by simple rules then there's a bias toward simplicity and pliant Occam's razor is the mechanism to finding these rules and actually in a more quantitative sense and we come back to that later in terms of some Roman attraction you can rigorously prove that usually assume that the world is simple then Occam's razor is the best you can do in a certain sense so I apologize for the romanticized question but why do you think outside of its effectiveness why do we do you think we find simplicity so appealing as human beings well just why does e equals mc-squared seems so beautiful to us humans I guess mostly in general many things can be explained by an evolutionary argument and you know there's some artifacts and humans which you know are just artifacts and not an evolutionary necessary but there's this beauty and simplicity it's I believe at least the core is about like science finding regularities in the world understanding the world which is necessary for survival right you know if I look at a bush right and I just seen Norris and there is a tiger right and eats me then I'm dead but if I try to find a pattern and we know that humans are prone to find more patterns in data than they are you know like the you know Mars face and all these things but these buyers towards finding patterns even if they are not but I mean its best of course if they are yeah helps us for survival yeah that's fascinating I haven't thought really about this I thought I just loved science but they're indeed from in terms of just for survival purposes there is an evolutionary argument for why why we find the work of Einstein is so beautiful maybe a quick small tangent could you describe what's Solomonov induction is yeah so that's a theory which I claim and Riesling enough sort of claimed you know a long time ago that this solves the big philosophical problem of induction and I believe the claim is essentially true and what it does is the following so okay for the picky listener induction can be interpreted narrowly and wildly narrow means inferring models from data and widely means also then using these models for doing predictions or predictions also part of of the induction so I'm little sloppy sort of as a terminology and maybe that comes from ray solomonoff you know being sloppy maybe saying it we can't complain anymore so let me explain a little bit this theory yeah in simple terms so assume we have a data sequence make it very simple the simplest one say 1 1 1 1 1 and you see if 100 ones yeah what do you think comes next the natural order I repeat up a little bit the natural answer is of course you know 1 ok and questions why ok well we see a pattern there yeah ok there's a 1 and we repeat it and why should it suddenly after a hundred ones be different so what we're looking for is simple explanations or models for the data we have and now the question is a model has to be presented in a certain language in which language to be used in science we want formal languages and we can use mathematics or we can use programs on a computer so abstract me on a Turing machine for instance or can be a general-purpose computer so and they of course lots of models of you can say maybe it's a hundred ones and then 100 zeros and a hundred ones that's a model right but there are simpler models there's a model print one loop and it also explains the data and if you push the to the extreme you are looking for the shortest program which if you run this program reproduces the data you have it will not stop it will continue naturally and this you take for your prediction and on the sequence of ones it's very plausible right at the print one loop it's the shortest program we can give some more complex examples like 1 2 3 4 5 what comes next the short program is again you know counter and so that is roughly speaking house a lot of interaction works the extra twist is that it can also deal with noisy data so if you have for instance a coin flip say a biased coin which comes up head with 60% probability then it will predict if you learn and figure this out and after a while it predict or the next coin flip will be head with probability 60% so it's the stochastic version of that but the goal is the dream is always the search for the short program yes yeah well in solomonov induction precisely what you do is so you combine so looking for the shortest program is like applying AAPIs race like looking for the simplest theory there's also a pakoras principle which says if you have multiple hypotheses which equally well describe you data don't discard any of them keep all of them around you never know and you can put it together and say ok have a buyer's to her simplicity but I don't rule out the larger models and technically what we do is we weigh the shorter models higher and the longer models lower and you use a Bayesian techniques you have a prior and which is precisely 2 to the minus the complexity of the program and you weigh all this hypotheses and take this mixture and then you get also this plasticity in yeah like many of your ideas that's just a beautiful idea of weighing based on the simplicity of the program I love that that that seems to me may be a very human central concept seems to be a very appealing way of discovering good programs in this world you've used the term compression quite a bit I think it's a beautiful idea sort of we just talked about simplicity and maybe science or just all of our intellectual pursuits is basically the attempt to compress the complexity all around us into something simple so what does this word mean to you compression I essentially have already explained it so it compression means for me finding short programs for the data or the phenomena at hand you could interpret it more widely as you know finding simple theories which can be mathematical theory so maybe even informal you know like you know just inverts compression means finding short descriptions explanations programs little data do you see science as a kind of our human attempt at compression so we're speaking more generally because when you say programs kind of zooming in a particular sort of almost like computer science artificial intelligence focus but do you see all of human endeavor as a kind of compression well at least all of science ICSI and evolve compression at all of humanity maybe and well they are so other aspects of science like experimental design right I mean we we create experiments specifically to get extra knowledge and this is that isn't part of the decision-making process but once we have the data to understand the data is essentially compression so I don't see any difference between contrast compression understanding and prediction so we're jumping around topics a little bit but returning back the simplicity a fascinating concept of komagawa of complexity so in your sense the most objects in our mathematical universe have high komagawa of complexity and maybe what is first of all what is coma graph complexity ok Kolmogorov complexity is a notion of simplicity or complexity and it takes the compression view to the extreme so I explained before that if you have some data sequence just think about a file on a computer and best sort of you know just a string of bits and if you and we have data compresses likely compress big files in terms a sip files with certain compressors and you can also put yourself extracting archives that means as an executable if you run it it reproduces the original file without needing an extra decompressor it's just a decompressor plus the archive together in one and now there are better and worse compressors and you can ask what is the ultimate compressor so what is the shortest possible self-extracting archives you could produce for a certain data set yeah which reproduces the data set and the length of this is called the Kolmogorov complexity and arguably that is the information content in the data set I mean if the data set is very redundant or very boring you can compress it very well so the information content should be low and you know it is low according to this difference this is the length of the shortest program that summarizes the data yes yeah and what's your sense of our sort of universe when we think about the different the different objects in our universe that we each are concepts or whatever the at every level do they have higher or local girl complexity so what's the hope do we have a lot of hope and be able to summarize much of our world that's a tricky and difficult question so as I said before I believe that the whole universe based on the evidence we have is very simple so it has a very short description the whole sorry did you would you linger on that the whole universe what does I mean do you mean at the very basic fundamental level in order to create the universe yes yeah so you need a very short program when you run it to get the thing going you get the thing going and then it will reproduce our universe and there's a problem with noise we can come back to the later possibly noise a problem or a fear is it a bug or a feature I would say it makes our life as a scientist really really much harder I didn't think about without noise we wouldn't need all of the statistics but that maybe we wouldn't feel like there's a free will maybe we need that for the ethics this is an illusion that Norris can give you freezing that way it's a feature but also if you don't have noise you have chaotic phenomena which are effectively like noise so we can't you know get away with statistics even then I mean think about rolling a dice and you know forget about quantum mechanics and you know exactly how you you throw it but I mean it's still so hard to compute a trajectory that effectively it is best to model it you know as you know coming out this a number this probability 1 over 6 but from from this set of philosophical como go of complexity perspective if we didn't have noise then arguably you could describe the whole universe as well as standard model plus general relativity I mean we don't have a theory of everything yet but sort of assuming we are close to it or have it here plus the initial conditions which may hopefully be simple and then you just run it and then you would reproduce the universe but that's all by noise or by chaotic systems or by initial conditions which you know may be complex so now if we don't the whole universe but just a subset you know just take planet Earth planet Earth cannot be compressed you know into a couple of equations this is a hugely complex just so interesting so when you look at the window like the whole thing might be simple when you just take a small window then it may become complex and that may be counterintuitive but there's a very nice analogy the the book the library of all books so imagine you have a normal library with interesting books and you go there great lots of information and you quite complex yeah so now I create a library which contains all possible books say of 500 pages so the first book just has a aaaa over all the pages the next book aaaa and ends with P and so on I create this library of all books I can write a super short program which creates this library so this library which has all books has zero information content and you take a subset of this library and suddenly have a lot of information in there so that's fascinating I think one of the most beautiful object mathematical objects that at least today seems to be under study or under talked about is cellular automata what lessons do you draw from sort of the game of life for cellular automata where you start with the simple rules just like you're describing with the universe and somehow complexity emerges do you feel like you have an intuitive grasp on the behavior the fascinating behavior of such systems where some like you said some chaotic behavior it could happen some complexity could emerge some it could die out and some very rigid structures you have a sense about cellular automata that somehow transfers maybe to the bigger questions of our universe is a cellular automata and especially the Conway's Game of Life is really great because this rule are so simple you can explain it to every child and mean by hand you can simulate a little bit and you see these beautiful patterns emerge and people have proven you know that is even Turing complete you cannot just use a computer to simulate game of life but you can also use game of life to simulate any computer that is truly amazing and it's it's the prime example probably to demonstrate that very simple rules can lead to very rich phenomena and people you know sometimes you know how can how is chemistry and biology is so rich I mean this can't be based on simple rules yeah but now we know quantum electrodynamics describes all of chemistry and and become later back to that I claim intelligence can be explained or described in one single equation this very rich phenomenon you asked also about whether you know I understand this phenomenon and it's probably not and this is saying you never understand really things you just get used to them and pretty using used to sell all automata so you believe that you understand now why this phenomenon happens but I give you a different example I didn't play too much with this converse game of life but a little bit more with fractals and with the Mandelbrot set and it's beautiful you know patterns just just look Mandelbrot set and well when the computers were really slow in our just a black and white monitor and programmed my own program sana in assembler - Wow Wow to get these vectors on the screen and it was mesmerised and much later so I returned to this you know every couple of years and then I try to understand what is going on and you can understand a little bit so I try to derive the locations you know there are these circles and the Apple shape and then you have smaller Mandelbrot sets recursively in this set in this way to mathematically by solving high order polynomials to figure out where these centers are and what size there are approximately and by sort of ant mathematically approaching this problem you slowly get a feeling of why things are like they are and that sort of isn't you know first step to understanding why this rich phenomena do you think as P as possible what's your intuition you think it's possible to reverse engineer and find the short program that generated the these fractals sort of by what looking at the fractals well in principle yes yeah so I mean in principle what you can do is you take you know any data set you know you take these fractals or you take whatever your data set whatever you have say a picture of conveys game of life and you run through all programs you take your programs 1 2 3 4 and all these programs around them all in parallel in so called dovetailing fashion give them computational resources first one 50% second 1/2 resources and so on and let them run wait until they halt give an output compare it to your data and if some of these programs produced the correct data then you stop and then you have already used some program it may be a long program because it's faster and then you continue and you get shorter and shorter programs until you eventually find the shortest program the interesting thing you can never know whether to short this program because there could be an even shorter program which is just even slower and you just have to wait here but asymptotically and actually after finite time you have this shortest program so this is a theoretical but completely impractical way of finding the underlying structure in every data set and there was a lot of interaction dolls and Kolmogorov complexity in practice of course we have to approach the problem more intelligently and then if you take resource limitations into account there's friends the field of pseudo-random numbers yeah and these are random that must so these are deterministic sequences but no algorithm which is fast fast means runs in polynomial time can detect that it's actually deterministic so we can produce interesting I mean random numbers maybe not that interesting but just an example we can produce complex looking data and we can then prove that no fast algorithm can detect the underlying pattern which is unfortunately is it that's a big challenge for our search for simple programs in the space of artificial intelligence perhaps yes it definitely is quantitative intelligence and it's quite surprising that it's I can't say easy here I mean worked really hard to find his theories but apparently it was possible for human minds to find these simple rules in the universe it could have been different right it could have been different it's it's uh it's inspiring so let me ask another absurdly big question what is intelligence in your view so I have of course a definition I wasn't sure what you're gonna say because you could have just as easily said I have no clue which many people would say I'm not modest in this question so the the informal version which ever got together be shame like who co-founded in mind is that intelligence measures an agent's ability to perform well in a wide range of environments so that doesn't sound very impressive and but it these words have been very carefully chosen and there is a mathematical theory behind it and we come back to that later and if you look at this this definition right itself it seems like yeah okay but it seems a lot of things are missing but if you think it through then you realize that most and I claim all of the other traits at least of rational intelligence which we usually associate intelligence are emergent phenomena from this definition in creativity memorization planning knowledge you all need that in order to perform well in a wide range of environments so you don't have to explicitly mention that in a definition interesting so yeah so the consciousness abstract reasoning or all these kinds of things are just emerging phenomena that help you in towards can you say the definition against multiple environments did you mention or goals no but we have an alternative definition instead of performing value conscious replace it by goals so intelligence measures an agent ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments that's more or less because in there there's an injection of the word goals so you to specify their there should be a goal yeah but perform well is sort of what is it does it mean it's the same problem yeah there's a little gray area but it's much closer to something that could be formalized re in your view are humans where do humans fit into that definition are they general intelligence systems that are able to perform in like how good are they at fulfilling that definition at performing well in multiple environments yeah that's a big question I mean the humans are performing best among all species as we know we know of yeah depends you could say that trees and plants are doing better job they'll probably outlast us so yeah but they're in a much more narrow environment right I mean you just you know I have a little bit of air pollutions and these trees die and we can adapt right we build houses with filters we we we do geoengineering so multiple environment part yes that is very important yes so that distinguish narrow intelligence from wide intelligence also in the AI research so let me ask the the Alan Turing question can machines think can machines be intelligent so in your view I have to kind of ask the answer is probably yes but I want to kind of here with your thoughts on it can machines be made to fulfill this definition of intelligence to achieve intelligence well we are sort of getting there and you know on a small scale we are already there the wide range of environments is missing about yourself driving cars we have programs which play go and chess we have speech recognition so it's pretty amazing but you can you know these are narrow environments but if you look at alpha zero that was also developed by deep mind I mean what famous alphago and then came alpha zero a year later there was truly amazing so on reform a learning algorithm which is able just by self play to play chess and then also go and I mean yes they're both games but they're quite different games and you know this you didn't don't feed them the rules of the game and the most remarkable thing which is still a mystery to me that usually for any decent chess program I don't know much about go you need opening books and endgame tables and so on - and nothing in there nothing was put in there it was alpha zero there's the self play mechanism starting from scratch being able to learn actually new strategies is uh yeah it did rediscovered you know all these famous openings within four hours by himself what I was really happy about I'm a terrible chess player but I like queen Gumby and alpha zero figured out that this is the best opening correct so yes that you do to answer your question yes I believe that general intelligence is possible and it also depends how you define it do you say AGI with general intelligence artificial general intelligence only refers to if you achieve human-level or a subhuman level but quite broad is it also general intelligence so we have to distinguish or it's only super human intelligence general artificial intelligence is there a test in your mind like the Turing test for natural language or some other test that would impress the heck out of you that would kind of cross the line of your sense of intelligence within the framework that you said well the Turing test well has been criticized a lot but I think it's not as bad as some people thinking some people think it's too strong so it tests not just for a system to be intelligent but it also has to fake human deception this section right which is you know much harder and on the other hand they say it's too weak yeah because it just may be fakes you know emotions or intelligent behavior it's not real but I don't think that's the problem or big problem so if if you would pass the Turing test so conversation over terminal with a bot for an hour or maybe a day or so and you can fool a human into you know not knowing whether this is a human or not that it's during tests I would be truly impressed and we have this annual competitions alumna price and I mean it started with Elijah that was the first conversational program and what is it called the Japanese Mitsouko or so that's the winner of the last you know a couple of years and well impressive yes quite impressive and then google has developed Meena right just just recently that's an open domain conversational but just a couple of weeks ago I think yeah I kind of like the metric that sort of the Alexa price has proposed and he maybe it's obvious to you it wasn't to me of setting sort of a length of a conversation like you want the bot to be sufficiently interestingly you'd want to keep talking to it for like 20 minutes and that's a that's a surprisingly effective in aggregate metric because it really like nobody has the patience to be able to talk to about that's not interesting in intelligent and witty and is able to go on the different tangents jump domains be able to you know say something interesting to maintain your attention maybe many humans whoops also fail this test unfortunately we set just like with autonomous vehicles with chat BOTS we also set a bar that's way too hard high to reach I said you know the Turing test is not as bad as some people believe you got what is really not useful about the Turing test it gives us no guidance how to develop these systems in the first place of course you know we can develop them by trial and error and you know do whatever and and then run the test and see whether it works or not but a mathematical definition of intelligence gives us you know an objective which we can then analyze by you know theoretical tools or computational and you know maybe improve how close we are and we will come back to that later with a sexy model so or I mention the compression right so in natural language processing and they have chiefed amazing results and are one way to test this of course you know take the system you train it then you you know see how well it performs on the task but a lot of performance measurement is done by so called perplexity this is essentially the same as complexity or compression length so the NLP community develops new systems and then they measure the compression length and then they have ranking and leaks because there's a strong correlation between compressing well and then this systems performing well at the task at hand it's not perfect but it's good enough for them as as an intermediate aim so you mean a measure so this is kind of almost returning to the coma girl of complexity so you're saying good compression usually means good intelligence yes so you mentioned you're one of the one of the only people who dared boldly to try to formalize our the idea of artificial general intelligence to have a a mathematical framework for intelligence just like as we mentioned termed IHC AI X I so let me ask the basic question what is IHC okay so let me first say what it stands for because letter stands for actually that's probably the more basic question but it the first question is usually how how it's pronounced but finally I put it on the website how it's pronounced and you figured it out yeah the name comes from AI artificial intelligence and the X I is the Greek letter X I which are used for solo manav's distribution for quite stupid reasons which I'm not willing to repeat here in front of camera so it just happened to be more less arbitrary I chose to excite but it also has nice other interpretations so their actions and perceptions in this model write an agent his actions and perceptions and overtime so this is a Index IX index I so this action at time I and then followed by reception at time I will go with that I let it out the first part yes I'm just kidding I have some interpretations so at some point maybe five years ago or ten years ago I discovered in in Barcelona it wasn't a big church there wasn't you know stone engraved some text and the word I see appeared there I was very surprised and and and and happy about it and I looked it up so it is Catalan language and it means with some interpretation of debts it that's the right thing to do yeah Eureka Oh so it's almost like destined somehow came yeah yeah came to you in a dream so Osceola there's a Chinese word I she also written a galaxy if you could transcribe that opinion then the final one is that is AI crossed with induction because status and that's going more to the content now so good old-fashioned AI is more about you know planning and known data mystic world and induction is more about often yellow area D data and inferring models and essentially what this accident does is combining these two and I actually also recently I think heard that in Japanese AI means love so so if you can combine excise somehow with that I think we can there might be some interesting ideas there so I let's then take the next step can you maybe talk at the big level of what is this mathematical framework yeah so it consists essentially of two parts one is the learning and induction and prediction part and the other one is the planning part so let's come first to the learning induction prediction part which essentially I explained already before so what we need for any agent to act well is that it can somehow predict what happens I mean if you have no idea what your actions do how can you decide which acts not good or not so you need to have some model of what your actions affect so what you do is you have some experience you build models like scientists you know of your experience then you hope these models are roughly correct and then you use these models for prediction and the model is sorry to interrupt our model is based on you perception of the world how your actions will affect that world that's not so what is the important part but it is technically important but at this stage we can just think about predicting say stock market data whether data or IQ sequences one two three four five what comes next yeah so of course our actions affect what we're doing but I come back to that in a second so and I'll keep just interrupting so just to draw a line between prediction and planning or what do you mean by prediction in this and this where it's trying to predict the environment without your long-term action in the environment what is prediction okay if you want to put the actions in now okay then let's put in a now yes so the question okay so this is the simplest form of prediction is that you just have data which you passively observe yes and you want to predict what happens without you know interfering as I said weather forecasting stock market IQ sequences or just anything okay and Salama of zeref interaction based on compression so you look for the shortest program which describes your data sequence and then you take this program run it which reproduces your data sequence by definition and then you let it continue running and then it will produce some predictions and you can rigorously prove that for any prediction task this is essentially the best possible predictor of course if there's a prediction task or tasks which is unpredictable like you know your fair coin flips yeah I cannot predict the next fair country but Solomon of Tarsus says okay next head is probably 50% it's the best you can do so if something is unpredictable Salama will also not magically predicted but if there is some pattern and predictability then Solomonov induction we'll figure that out eventually and not just eventually but rather quickly and you can have proof convergence rates whatever your data is so there's pure magic in a sense what's the catch well the catch is that is not computable and we come back to that later you cannot just implement it in even this Google resources here and run it and you know predict the stock market and become rich I mean if ray solomonoff already not write it at the time but the basic task is you know you're in the environment and you're interacting with an environment to try to learn a model the environment and the model is in the space as these all these programs and your goal is to get a bunch of programs that are simple and so let's let's go to the actions now but actually good that you asked usually I skip this part also there is also a minor contribution which I did so the action part but they usually sort of just jump to the decision path so let me explain to the action part now thanks for asking so you have to modify it a little bit by now not just predicting a sequence which just comes to you but you have an observation then you act somehow and then you want to predict the next observation based on the past observation and your action then you take the next action you don't care about predicting it because you're doing it and then you get the next observation and you want more before you get it you want to predict it again based on your past action and observation sequence it's just condition extra on your actions there's an interesting alternative that you also try to predict your own actions if you want oh in the past or the future your future actions wait let me wrap I think my brain is broke we should maybe discussed it later Biff after I've explained the Ising model it's an interesting variation but this is a really interesting variation and a quick comment I don't know if you want to insert that in here but you're looking at in terms of observations you're looking at the entire the big history a long history of the observations exactly it's very important the whole history from birth sort of of the agent and we can come back to that I'm also why this is important here often you know in RL you have MVPs Markov decision processes which are much more limiting okay so now we can predict conditioned on actions so even if the influenced environment but prediction is not all we want to do right we also want to act really in the world and the question is how to choose the actions and we don't want to greedily choose the actions you know just you know what is best in in the next time step and we first I should say you know what is you know how to be measure performance so we measure performance by giving the agent reward that's the so called reinforcement learning framework so every time step you can give it a positive reward or negative reward or baby no reward it could be a very scarce right like if you play chess just at the end of the game you give +1 for winning or -1 for losing so in the aixi framework that's completely sufficient so occasionally you give a reward signal and you ask the agent to maximise reverb but not greedily sort of you know the next one next one because that's very bad in the long run if you're greedy so but over the lifetime of the agent so let's assume the agent lives for M times that'll say it dies in sort of hundred years sharp that's just you know the simplest model to explain so it looks at the future reward sum and ask what is my action sequence or actually more precisely my policy which leads in expectation because I don't know the world to the maximum reward some let me give you an analogy in chess for instance we know how to play optimally in theory it's just a minimax strategy I play the move which seems best to me under the assumption that the opponent plays the move which is best for him so best serve worst for me and the assumption that he I play again the best move and then you have this expecting max three to the end of the game and then you back propagate and then you get the best possible move so that is the optimal strategy which for norman already figured out a long time ago for playing adversarial games luckily or maybe unluckily for the theory it becomes harder the world is not always adversarial so it can be if the other humans even cooperative fear or nature is usually I mean the dead nature is stochastic you know you know things just happen randomly or I don't care about you so what you have to take into account is a noise now and not necessarily Realty so you'll replace the minimum on the opponent's side by an expectation which is general enough to include also the serial cases so now instead of a minimax trials you have an expecting max strategy so far so good so that is well known it's called sequential decision theory but the question is on which probability distribution do you base that if I have the true probability distribution like say I play backgammon right there's dice and there's certain randomness involved you know I can calculate probabilities and feed it in the expecting max or the signature disease we come up is the optimal decision if I have enough compute but in the for the real world we don't know that you know what is the probability you drive in front of me brakes and I don't know you know so depends on all kinds of things and especially new situations I don't know so this is this unknown thing about prediction and there's where solomonoff comes in so what you do is in sequential decision jury it just replace the true distribution which we don't know by this Universal distribution I didn't explicitly talk about it but this is used for universal prediction and plug it into the sequential decision tree mechanism and then you get the best of both worlds you have a long-term planning agent but it doesn't need to know anything about the world because there's a lot of induction part learns can you explicitly try to describe the universal distribution and how some of induction plays a role here yeah I'm trying to understand so what it does it I'm so in the simplest case I said take the shortest program describing your data run it have a prediction which would be deterministic yes okay but you should not just take a shortest program but also consider the longer ones but keep it lower a priori probability so in the Bayesian framework you say a priori any distribution which is a model or stochastic program has a certain a priori probability which is 2 to the minus and Y to the minus length you know I could explain length of this program so longer programs are punished yes a priori and then you multiplied with the so-called likelihood function yeah which is as the name suggests is how likely is this model given the data at hand so if you have a very wrong model it's very unlikely that this model is true so it is very small number so even if the model is simple it gets penalized by that and what you do is then you take just the some word this is the average over it and this gives you a probability distribution so with universal distribution of phenomena of distribution so it's weighed by the simplicity of the program and likelihood yes it's kind of a nice idea yeah so okay and then you said there's you're playing N or M or forgot the letter steps into the future so how difficult is that problem what's involved there okay so here's a customization problem what do we do yes so you have a planning problem up to horizon M and that's exponential time in in the horizon M which is I mean it's computable but in fact intractable I mean even for chess it's already intractable to do that exactly and you know it could be also discounted kind of framework or yes so so having a heart arising you know at numbered years it's just for simplicity of discussing the model and also sometimes the math is simple but there are lots of variations actually quite interesting parameter is its there's nothing really problematic about it but it's very interesting so for instance you think no let's let's then let's let the parameter M tend to infinity right you want an agent which lives forever all right if you do it novel you have two problems first the mathematics breaks down because you have an infinite reward some which may give infinity and getting river 0.1 in the time step is infinity and giving you got one every time service Definity so equally good not really what we want other problem is that if you have an infinite life you can be lazy for as long as you want for ten years yeah and then catch up with the same expected reward and you know think about yourself or you know or maybe you know some friends or so if they knew they lived forever you know why work hard now you know just enjoy your life you know and then catch up later so that's another problem with infinite horizon and you mentioned yes we can go to discounting but then the standard discounting is so called geometric discounting so $1 today is about worth as much as you know one dollar and five cents tomorrow so if you do this so called geometric discounting you have introduced an effective horizon so the Aged is now motivated to had a certain amount of time effectively it's likely moving horizon and for any fixed effective horizon there is a problem to solve which requires larger horizon so if I look ahead you know five time steps I'm a terrible chess player right and I'll need to look ahead longer if I play go I probably have to look ahead even longer so for every problem there forever horizon there is a problem which this horizon cannot solve yes but I introduced the so-called near harmonic horizon which goes down with one or tea rather than exponential in T which produces an agent which effectively looks into the future proportional to its age so if it's five years old it plans for five years if it's hundred years older than plans for hundred years interesting and a little bit similar to humans - right and my children don't plan ahead very long but then we get the doll - a player I had more longer maybe when we get all very old I mean we know that we don't live forever and you're maybe then how horizon shrinks again so just adjusting the horizon what is there some mathematical benefit of that of or is just a nice I mean intuitively empirically probably a good idea to sort of push the horizon back to uh extend the horizon as you experience more of the world but is there some mathematical conclusions here that are beneficial mr. Loman who talks just a prediction probably have extremely strong finite time but no finite data result so you have sown so much data then you lose on so much so so the dt r is really great with the aixi model with the planning part many results are only asymptotic which well this is what is asymptotic means you can prove for instance that in the long run if the agent you know x long enough then you know it performs optimal or some nice things happens so but you don't know how fast it converges yeah so it may converge fast but we're just not able to prove it because a difficult so that is really dead slow yeah so so that is what asymptotic means sort of eventually but we don't know how fast and if I give the agent a fixed horizon M yeah then I cannot prove asymptotic results right so I mean sort of people dies in hundred years then and hundred uses over cannot say eventually so this is the advantage of the discounting that I can prove on some topic results so just to clarify so so I okay I made I've built up a model well now in a moment I've have this way of looking several steps ahead how do I pick what action I will take it's like with a playing chess right you do this minimax in this case here do expect the max based on the selamat of distribution you propagate back and then while inaction falls out the action which maximizes the future expected reward on the Solano's distribution and then you just take this action and then repeat until you get a new observation and you feed it in this excellent observation then you repeat and the reward so on yeah so you're a row - yeah and then maybe you can even predict your own action however the idea but okay this big framework what is it this is I mean it's kind of a beautiful mathematical framework to think about artificial general intelligence what can you what does it help you into it about how to build such systems or maybe from another perspective what does it help us to in understanding AGI so when I started in the field I was always interested two things one was you know AGI i'm the name didn't exist 10 24th of january iowa strong AI and physics he over everything so i switched back and forth between computer science and physics quite often you said the theory of everything the theory of everything just alike it was a basically the string of flavors problems before all all of humanity yeah I can explain if you wanted some later time you know why I'm interesting these two questions Nestle and a small tangent if if if one to be it was one to be solved which one would you if one if you were if an apple found you head and there was a brilliant insight and you could arrive at the solution to one would it be AGI or the theory of everything definitely AGI because once the AGI problem solve they can ask the AGI to solve the other problem for me yeah brilliant a put okay so so as you were saying about it okay so and the reason why I didn't settle I mean this thought about you know once we have solved HDI it solves all kinds of other not just as here every problem about all kinds of use more useful problems to humanity it's very appealing to many people and you know I thought also that I was quite disappointed with the state of the art of the field of AI there was some theory you know about logical reasoning but I was never convinced that this will fly and then there was this Homer more holistic approaches with neural networks and I didn't like these heuristics so and also I didn't have any good idea myself so that's the reason why I toggle back and forth quite some violent even worked some four and a half years and a company developing software something completely unrelated but then I had this idea about the aixi model and so what it gives you it gives you a gold standard so I have proven that this is the most intelligent agents which anybody could build built in quotation mark right because it's just mathematical and you need infinite compute yeah but this is the limit and this is completely specified it's not just a framework and it you know every year tens of frameworks are developed with just have skeletons and then pieces are missing and usually these missing pieces you know turn out to be really really difficult and so this is completely and uniquely defined and we can analyze that mathematically and we've also developed some approximations I can talk about it a little bit later that would dissolve the top-down approach like say for Norman's minimax theory that's the theoretical optimal play of games and now we need to approximate it put heuristics in prune the tree blah blah blah and so on so we can do that also with an icy body but for generally I it can also inspire those and most of most researchers go bottom-up right they have the systems that try to make it more general more intelligent it can inspire in which direction to go what do you mean by that so if you have some choice to make right so how should they evaluate my system if I can't do cross validation how should I do my learning if my standard regularization doesn't work well you know so the answer is always this we have a system which does everything that's actually it's just you know completing the ivory tower completely useless from a practical point of view but you can look at it and see oh yeah maybe you know I can take some aspects and you know instead of Kolmogorov complexity there just take some compressors which has been developed so far and for the planning well we have used it here which is also you know being used in go and it at least it's inspired me a lot to have this formal definition and if you look at other fields you know like I always come back to physics because I'm a physics background think about the Phenom of energy that was long time a mysterious concept and at some point it was completely formalized and that really helped a lot and you can point out a lot of these things which were first mysterious and wake and then they have been rigorously formalized speed and acceleration has been confused tried until it was formally defined here there was a time like this and in people you know often you know know don't have any background you know still confused it so and this is a model or the the intelligence definitions which is sort of the dual to it we come back to that later formalizes the notion of intelligence uniquely and rigorously so in in the sense it serves as kind of the light at the end of the tunnel so before yeah so I mean there's a million question I could ask her so maybe the kind of ok let's feel around in the dark a little bit so there's been here a deep mind but in general been a lot of breakthrough ideas just like we've been saying around reinforcement learning so how do you see the progress in reinforcement learning is different like which subset of IHC does it occupy the current like you said the maybe the Markov assumptions made quite often in reinforce for learning the there's other assumptions made in order to make the system work what do you see is the difference connection between reinforcement learning in Nyack see and so the major difference is that essentially all other approaches they make stronger assumptions so in reinforcement learning the Markov assumption is that the the next state or next observation only depends on the on the previous observation and not the whole history which makes of course the mathematics much easier and rather than dealing with histories of course their profit from it also because then you have algorithms that run on current computers and do something practically useful but for generally are all the assumptions which are made by other approaches we know already now they are limiting so for instance usually you need a go digital assumption in the MDP frameworks in order to learn it goes this T essentially means that you can recover from your mistakes and that they are not traps in the environment and if you make this assumption then essentially it can you know go back to a previous state go there a couple of times and then learn what what statistics and what the state is like and then in the long run perform well in this state yeah but there are no fundamental problems but in real life we know you know there can be one single action you know one second of being inattentive while driving a car fast you know you can ruin the rest of my life I can become quadriplegic or whatever so and there's no recovery anymore so the real world is not err gorica I always say you know there are traps and there are situations we are not recover from and very little theory has been developed for this case what about what do you see in there in the context of I see as the role of exploration sort of you mentioned you know in the in the real world and get into trouble when we make the wrong decisions and really pay for it but exploration it seems to be fundamentally important for learning about this world for gaining new knowledge so is it his exploration baked in another way to ask it what are the parameters of this of IHC it can be controlled yeah I say the good thing is that there are no parameters to control and some other people track knobs to control and you can do that I mean you can modify axes so that you have some knobs to play with if you want to but the exploration is directly baked in and that comes from the Bayesian learning and the long-term planning so these together already imply exploration you can nicely and explicitly prove that for simple problems like so-called banded problems where you say to give a real world example say you have two medical treatments a and B you don't know the effectiveness you try a a little bit be a little bit but you don't want to harm too many patients so you have to sort of trade-off exploring yeah and at some point you want to explore and you can do the mathematics and figure out the optimal strategy it took a Bayesian agency also non-bayesian agents but it shows that this Bayesian framework by taking a prior over possible world's doing the Bayesian mixture then the Bayes optimal decision with long term planning that is important automatically implies exploration also to the proper extent not to much exploration and not too little in this very simple settings in the IHC model and was also able to prove that it is a self optimizing theorem or asymptotic optimality theorems or later only asymptotic not finite time bounds it seems like the long term planning is a really important but the long term part of the planet is really important yes and also I mean maybe a quick tangent how important do you think is removing the Markov assumption and looking at the full history sort of intuitively of course it's important but is it like fundamentally transformative to the entirety of the problem what's your sense of it like because we all we make that assumption quite often it's just throwing away the past now I think it's absolutely crucial the question is whether there's a way to deal with it in a more holistic and still sufficiently well way so I have to come up with an example and fly but you know you have say some you know key event in your life you know a long time ago you know in some city or something you realize you know that's a really dangerous street or whatever right here and you want to remember that forever right in case you come back they're kind of a selective kind of memory so you remember that all the important events in the past but somehow selecting the importance is see that's very hard yeah and I'm not concerned about you know just storing the whole history just you can calculate you know human life says so you're 100 years doesn't matter right how much data comes in through the vision system and the auditory system you compress it a little bit in this case law silly and store it we are soon in the means of just storing it yeah but you still need to the selection for the planning part and the compression for the understanding part the raw storage I'm really not concerned about and I think we should just store if you develop an agent preferably just restore all the interaction history and then you build of course models on top of it and you compress it and you are selective but occasionally you go back to the old data and reanalyze it based on your new experience you have you know sometimes you you're in school you learn all these things you think it's totally useless and you know much later you realize not you know it looks like as you thought I'm looking at you linear algebra right so maybe a minute let me ask about objective functions because that rewards it seems to be an important part the rewards are kind of given to the system for a lot of people the the specification of the objective function is a key part of intelligence like the the agent itself figuring out what is important what do you think about that is it possible within IHC framework to yourself discover the reward based on which you should operate okay that'll be a long answer so and it is a very interesting question and I asked a lot about this question where do the rivers come from and that depends yeah so and there you know I give you now a couple of answers so if you want to build agents now let's start simple so let's assume we want to build an agent based on the aixi model which performs a particular task let's start with something super simple like I mean super simple like playing chess or go or something yeah then you just you know the reward is you know winning the game is plus one losing theorems minus one done you apply this agent if you have enough compute you let itself play and it will learn the rules of the game will play perfect chess after some while problem solve okay so if you have more complicated problems then you may believe that you have the right rewrote but it's not so a nice cute example is elevator control that is also in rich Sutton's book which is a great book by the way so you control the elevator and you think well maybe the reward should be coupled to how long people wait in front of the elevator you know long wait is bad you program it and you do it and what happens is the elevator eagerly picks up all the people but never drops them off maybe the time in the elevator also counts so you minimize the sum yeah yeah in the elevator does that but never picks up the people in the tenth row in the top floor because in expectation it's not worth it just let them stay so so even in apparently simple problems you can make mistakes you know and that's what in in war serious context say a GI safety researchers consider so now let's go back to general agents so assume you want to build an agent which is generally useful to humans yes we have a household robot here and it should do all kinds of tasks so in this case the human should give the reward on the fly I mean maybe it's pre trained in the factory and there there's some sort of internal reward for you know the battery level or whatever here but so it you know it does the dishes badly you know you punish the robot intercept good you read what the robot and then train it do a new task you know like a child right so you need the human in the loop if you want a system which is useful to the human and as long as this agent stays up human level that should work reasonably well I'm apart from you know these examples it becomes critical if they become you know on a human level it's it's that miss children small children you have reason to be well under control they become older the river technique doesn't work so well anymore so then finally so this would be agents which are just you could sorry slaves to the humans yeah so if you are more ambitious and just say we want to build a new species of intelligent beings we put them on a new planet and we want them to develop this planet or whatever so we don't give them any reward so what could we do and you could try to you know come up with some reward functions like you know it should maintain itself the robot it should maybe multiply build more robots right and you know maybe for all kinds of things did you find useful but that's pretty hard right you know what what the self maintenance mean you know what does it mean to build a copy should be exact copy an approximate copy and so that's really hard but LaVon or so also a deep mind developed a beautiful model so it just took the aixi model and coupled the rewards to information gained so he said the reward is proportional to how much the agent had learned about the world and you can rigorously formally uniquely define it in terms of our case versions okay so if you put it in you get a completely autonomous agent and actually interestingly for this agent we can prove much stronger result and for the general agent which is also nice and if you let this agent loose it will be in a sense the optimal scientist is this absolutely curious to learn as much as possible about the world and of course it will also have a lot of instrumental goals right in order to learn it needs to at least survive right a dead agent is not good for anything so it needs to have self-preservation and if it builds small helpless acquiring more information it will do that yeah if exploration space exploration or whatever is necessary rights to gathering information and develop it so it has a lot of instrumental goals following on this information gain and this agent is completely autonomous of us no rebirth necessary anymore yeah of course you could define the awaited game the concept of information it gets stuck in that library that you mentioned beforehand with the was a very large number of books the first agent had this problem and it would get stuck in front of an old TV screen which has just said white noise yeah I know but the second version can deal with at least stochasticity well yeah what about curiosity this kind of word curiosity creativity is that kind of the reward function being of getting new information is that similar to idea of kind of injecting exploration for its own sake inside the reward function do you find this at all appealing interesting I think that's a nice definition curiosity is reward sorry curiosity is exploration for its own sake yeah I would accept that but most curiosity well in humans and especially in children yeah it's not just for its own sake but for actually learning about the environment and for behaving so I would I think most curiosity is tied in the end towards performing better well okay so if intelligence systems need to have the show function let me you're an intelligent system currently passing the Turing test quite effectively what what's the reward function of our human intelligence existence what's the reward function that Marcus hunter is operating under okay to the first question the biological reward function is to survive and to spread and very few humans sort of are able to overcome this biological reward function but we live in a very nice world where we have lots of spare time and can still survive and spread so we can develop arbitrary other interests which is quite interesting on top of that that yeah but this survival and spreading sort of is I would say the the goal or the reward function of human said that the core one I like how you avoided answering the second question which a good intelligence would so my that your own meaning of life and the reward function my own meaning of life and Riyad function is to find an AGI to build it beautifully put okay let's dissect Ickes even further so one of the assumptions is kind of infinity keeps creeping up everywhere which what are your thoughts and kind of bounded rationality and so the nature of our existence and intelligence systems is that we're operating all under constraints under you know limited time limited resources how does that how do you think about that with an IQ framework within trying to create an eg a system that operates under these constraints yeah that is one of the criticisms around I could see that it ignores computation and completely and some people believe that intelligence is inherently tied to what's bounded resources what do you think on this one point I think it's do you think the boundary of resources are fundamental to intelligence I would say that an intelligence notion which ignore computational limits is extremely useful a good intelligence notion which includes these resources would be even more useful but we don't have that yet and so look at other fields outside of computer science computational aspects never play a fundamental role you develop biological models for cells something in physics these theories I mean become more and more crazy and hard and harder to compute well in the end of course we need to do something with this model but this more a nuisance than a feature and I'm sometimes wondering if artificial intelligence would not sit in a computer science department but in a philosophy department then this computational focus would be probably significantly less I mean think about the induction problem is more in the philosophy department there's really no paper who cares about you know how long it takes to compute the answer there is completely secondary of course once we have figured out the first problem so intelligence without computational resources then the next and very good question is could we improve it by including computational resources but nobody was able to do that so far you know even halfway satisfactory manner I like that that's in the long run the right department to belong to this philosophy that's uh it's really quite a deep idea of or even to at least to think about big-picture philosophical questions big-picture questions even in the computer science department but you've mentioned approximation sort of there's a lot of infinity a lot of huge resources needed are there approximations - I see that within the EXCI framework that are useful you haven't haven't develop a couple of approximations and what we do there is that the Sonoma of induction part which was you know find the shortest program describe your data we just replace this by standard data compressors right and the better compressors get you know the better this part will become we focus on a particular compressor called context tree weighting which is pretty amazing lots of well known as beautiful theoretical properties also works reasonably well in practice so we use that for the approximation of the induction in the learning in the prediction part and from the planning part we essentially just took the ideas from a computer girl from 2006 I was Java tsipras Perry also now I did mind who developed the so-called you sit here algorithm upper confidence bound for trees algorithm on top of the Monte Carlo tree search so they approximate is planning part by sampling and it's successful on some small toy problems we don't want to lose the generality all right and that's sort of the handicap right if you want to be general you have to give up something so but this similar agent was able to play you know small games like cool poker and tic-tac-toe and and even pac-man into the same architecture no change the agent doesn't know the rules of the game really nothing in all by self or by a player with these environments so your grenade hoop would propose something called gate on machines which is a self-improving program that rewrites its own code well sort of mathematically philosophically what's the relationship in your eyes if you're familiar with it between IHC and the girl machines yeah familiar with it he developed it while I was in his lab you know so the girl machine explained briefly you give it a task it could be a simple task as you know finding prime factors in numbers right you can formally write it down there's a very slow algorithm to do that just all try all the factors yeah or play chess right optimally you write the algorithm to minimax to the end of the game so you write down what the girdle machine should do then it will take part of it resources to run this program and other part of the sources to improve this program and when it finds an improved version which provably it's the same answer so that's the key part yeah it needs to prove by itself that this change of program still satisfies the original specification and if it does so then it replaces the original program by the improved program and by definition does the same job but just faster okay and then you know it proved over it and over it and it's it's it's developed in a way that all parts of this girdle machine can self improve but it stays provably consistent with the original specification so from this perspective it has nothing to do with aixi but if you would now put axial as the starting axioms in it would run arc C but you know that takes forever but then if it finds a provable speed-up of Arc C it would replace it by this and that this and this and maybe eventually it comes up with a model which is still like C model it cannot be I mean just for the knowledgeable reader accessing computable and there can prove that therefore there cannot be a computable exact algorithm computers there needs to be some approximations and this is not dealt with a good machine so you have to do something about it but that's the ICT L model which is finitely computable which we could put in which part of X is an non computable the Solomonov induction part the interaction okay so but there's ways of getting computable approximation of the aixi model so then it's at least computable it is still way beyond any resources anybody will ever have but then the girdled machine could sort of improve it further and further in an exact way so what this is theoretically possible that the the girl machine process could improve isn't isn't or isn't actually already optimal it is optimal in terms of the river collected over its interaction cycles but it takes infinite time to produce one action and the world you know continues whether you want it or not yeah so the model is assuming had an Oracle which you know solve this problem and then in the next hundred milliseconds or reaction time you need gives the answer then ax is optimal so it's optimal in sense of date are also from learning efficiency and data efficiency but not in terms of computation time and then the other girl machine in theory but probably not provably could make it go faster yes ok interesting those two components are super interesting the sort of the the perfect intelligence combined with self-improvement sort of provable self improvement since he always liked it you're always getting the correct answer and you're improving the beautiful ideas okay so you've also mentioned that different kinds of things in in chase of solving this reward sort of optimizing for the goal interesting human things can emerge so is there a place for consciousness within IHC what where does uh maybe you can comment because I suppose we humans are just another instantiation Vioxx agents and we seem to have consciousness you say humans are an instantiation of Mike's agent yes oh that would be amazing but I think that's three for the smartest and most rational humans I think maybe we are very crude approximation interesting I mean I tend to believe again I'm Russian so I tend to believe our flaws are part of the optimal so the we tend to laugh off and criticize our flaws and I tend to think that that's actually close to an optimal behavior but some flaws if you think more carefully about it are actually not floss yeah but I think there are still enough flaws I don't know it's unclear as a student of history I think all the suffering that we've been endured as a civilization it's possible that that's the optimal amount of suffering we need to endure to minimize the long-term suffering that's your Russian background that's the Russian weather whoo humans are or not instantiation of an AI agent do you think there's a consciousness of something that could emerge in the no formal framework like IHC let me also ask you a question do you think I'm conscious that's a good question you you're that that tie is confusing me but I think you think it makes me unconscious because it strangles me if if an agent were to solve the imitation game posed by touring I think they would be dressed similarly to you that because there's a there's a kind of flamboyant interesting complex behavior pattern that sells that you're human and you're cautious but why do you ask was it a yes always gonna know yes I think you're conscious yes yeah so and you explain sort of somehow why but you infer that from my behavior right yeah you can never be sure about that and I think the same thing will happen with any intelligent way to be developed if it behaves in a way sufficiently close to humans or maybe if not humans I mean you know maybe a dog is also sometimes a little bit self-conscious right so so if it behaves in a way where we attribute typically consciousness we would actually build consciousness to this intelligent systems and you know except all in particular that of course doesn't answer the question whether it's really conscious and that's the you know the big hard problem of consciousness you know maybe I'm a zombie I mean not the movie zombie but the philosophical zombie it's to you the display of consciousness close enough to consciousness from a perspective of a GI that the distinction of the hard problem of consciousness is not an interesting one I think we don't have to worry about the consciousness problem especially the heart problem for developing a GI I think you know we progress at some point we have solved all the technical problems and this system will behave intelligent and then super intelligent and this consciousness will emerge I mean definitely it will display behavior which we will interpret as conscious and then it's a philosophical question did this consciousness really emerge or is zombie which just you know fakes everything we still don't have to figure that out although it may be interesting at least from a philosophical point of it's very interesting but it may also be sort of practically interesting you know there's some people say you know if it's just faking consciousness and feelings you know then we don't need to have be concerned about you know rights but if it's real conscious and has feelings then we need to be concerned yeah I can't wait til the day where AI systems exhibit consciousness because it'll truly be some of the hardest ethical questions how well we do with that it is rather easy to build systems which people ascribe consciousness and I give you an analogy I mean remember maybe once before you were born the Tamagotchi yes how dare you sir you're young right yes it's good thing yeah thank you thank you very much but I was also in the so you have any of those funny things but you have heard about this time ago it was you know really really primitive actually for the time it was and you know you could race you know this and and and and kids got so attached to it and you know didn't want to let it die and would have probably if we would have asked you know the children know do you think this drama coach is conscious and they would say yes yes I was yes that's kind of a beautiful thing actually because that consciousness ascribing consciousness seems to create a deeper connection yeah which is a powerful thing but we have to be careful on the ethics side of that well let me ask about the AGI community broadly you kind of represent some of the most serious work on a giass of at least or earlier and deepmind represents a serious work on AGI these days but why in your sense is the AGI communities so small or has been so small until maybe deep mine came along like why why aren't more people seriously working on human level and super human level intelligence from a formal perspective okay from a formal perspective that sort of you know and an extra point so I think a couple of reasons I mean AI came in waves right you know our interest in our summers and then there were big promises which were not fulfilled and people got disappointed and that narrow AI are sold in particular problems which seem to require intelligence was always to some extent successful and there were improvements small steps and if you build something which is you know useful for society or industrial useful then there's a lot of funding so I guess it wasn't pass the money which drives people to develop specific system solving specific tasks but you would think that you know at least on university you should be able to do ivory tower research and that was probably better a long time ago about even nowadays there's quite some pressure off of doing applied research or translational research and you know it's harder to get grants as a theorist so that also drives people away it's maybe also harder attacking the general intelligence problem so I think enough people I mean maybe a small number we're still interested in in formalizing intelligence and thinking of general intelligence but you know not much came up right or not much great stuff came up so what do you think we talked about the formal big light at the end of the tunnel but from the engineering perspective what do you think it takes to build an a GI system is it and I don't know if that's a stupid question or a distinct question from everything we've been talking about I exceed but what do you see as the steps that are necessary to take to start to try to build something so you wanted a blue print now and then you go and do it it's the whole point of this conversation try to squeeze that in there now is there I mean what's your intuition is it is in the robotic space or something that has a body and tries to explore the world is in the reinforcement learning space like the efforts of the alpha 0 and alpha star they're kind of exploring how you can solve it through in in the simulation in the gaming world their stuff and sort of the of the transformer working natural English processing so maybe attacking the open domain dialog like what where do you see a promising pathways let me pick the embodiment maybe so embodiment is important yes and no I don't believe that we need a physical robots walking or rolling around interacting with the real world in order to achieve AGI and I think it's more of a distraction probably than helpful it's sort of confusing the body with the mind for industrial applications or near-term applications of course we need robotics for all kinds of things yeah but for solving the big problem at least at this stage I think it's not necessary but the answer is also yes that I think the most promising approaches that you have an agent and you know there can be a virtual agent you know you know computer interacting with an environment possibly in our 3d simulated environment like in many computer games and and you train and learn the agent even if you don't intend to later put it sort of you know this algorithm in a robot brain and leave it forever in the virtual reality getting experience in a also it's just simulated 3d world is possibly and I say possibly important to understand things on a similar level as humans do especially if the agent or primarily if the agent wants needs to interact with the humans right you know if you talk about objects on top of each other in space and flying and cars and so on and the agent has no experience with even virtual 3d worlds it's probably hard to grasp so if you develop an abstract agent say we take the mathematical path and we just want to build an agent which can prove theorems and becomes a better imitation then this agent needs to be able to reason in very abstract spaces and then maybe sort of putting it into 3d environment simulated alt is even harmful it should sort of you put it in I don't know an environment which it creates itself or so it seems like you have an interesting rich complex trajectory through life in terms of your journey of ideas so it's interesting to ask what books technical fiction philosophical and books ideas people had a transformative effect books are most interesting because maybe people could also read those books and see if they could be inspired as well you're luckily asked books and not singular book it's very hard and I tried to pin down one book yeah then I can do that at the end so the most the books which were most transformative for me or which I can most highly recommend to people interested in AI both perhaps yeah I would always start with Russell and Norvig artificial intelligence a modern approach that's the AI Bible it's an amazing book it's very broad it covers you know all approaches to AI and even if you focus on one approach I think that is the minimum you should know about the other approaches out there so that should be your first book fourth edition should be coming out soon okay interesting deeper there's a deep learning chapter now so there must be written by Ian good fella okay and then the next book I would recommend the reinforcement only book by certain in part oh there's a beautiful book if there's any problem with the book it makes our L feel and look much easier than it actually is it's very gentle book it's very nice to read the exercises do you can very quickly you know get some aerial systems to run you know on very toy problems but it's a lot of fun and you in very in a couple of days you feel you know you know what RL is about but it's much harder than the book yeah come on now it's an awesome book yeah that idea's yeah and maybe I mean there's so many books out there if you like the information theoretic approach then there's Kolmogorov complexity by Alene batani but probably you know some some short article is enough you don't need to read a whole book but it's a great book and if you have to mention one all-time favorite book so different flavor that's a book which is used in the International Baccalaureate for high school students in several countries that's from Nicolas alchun theory of knowledge second edition or first not assert least the third one they put they took out all the fun okay so this asked all the interesting or to me interesting philosophical questions about how we acquire knowledge from all perspectives on from math from art from physics and ask how can we know I'm anything and book is called theory of knowledge from which is almost like a philosophical exploration of how we get knowledge from anything yes yeah I mean can religion tell us you know about something about the world can science tell us something about the world can mathematics so as it's just playing with symbols and onions open-ended questions and I mean it's for high school students so they have been resources from Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy and from Star Wars and the chicken cross the road yeah and it's it's it's fun to read and but it's also quite deep if you could live one day of your life over again because it made you truly happy or maybe like we said with the books it was truly transformative what what day what moment would you choose there's something pop into your mind doesn't need to be a day in the past or can it be a day in the future well space-time is an emergent phenomena so it's all the same anyway okay okay from the past you're really good saved from the future I love it no I will also tell you from the future okay from the past I would say when I discovered Maxim Allah I mean it was not in one day but it was one moment they are realized comig of complexity and didn't even know that it existed but I rediscovered sort of this compression idea myself but immediately I knew I can't be the first one but I had this idea and then I knew about sequential decision ray and I knew if I put it together this is the right thing and yeah I'm still when I think back about this moment I'm I'm super excited about it was there was there any more details and context that moment did an apple fall in your head were so like if you look at en Goodfellow talking about Gans there was beer involved there is there some more context of what sparked your thought it was a jest and no it was much more mundane so I've worked in this company so in this sense the four and a half years was not completely wasted so and I've worked on an image interpolation problem and I developed a quite neat new interpolation techniques and they got patented and then I you know and which happens quite often I got sort of overboard and thought about you know yeah that's pretty good but it's not the best so what is the best possible way of doing in the interpolation and then I thought yeah you you want the simplest picture which is if you cross train it recovers your original picture and then I you know thought about the simplicity concept more in quantitative terms and you know then everything developed and somehow love the full beautiful mix of also being a physicist and thinking about the big picture of it then led you to probably the end of a good idea so as a physicist I was probably trained not to always think in computational terms you know just ignore that and think about the other two the fundamental properties which you want to have so what about if you could really one day in the future all the day what would that be when I solve the AGI problem and I bring the practice in practice so in theory I have solved it that I see what already attracted me and then ask the first question or would be the first question what's the meaning of life I don't think there's a better way to end it thank you so much for talking it is a huge honor to finally meet you yeah thank you - I was a pleasure off my side - thanks for listening to this conversation with Marcus hunter and thank
