 the following is a conversation with Leslie Kayla bling she's a roboticist and professor at MIT she's recognized for her work and reinforcement learning planning robot navigation and several other topics in AI she won the edge KY computers and thought award and was the editor-in-chief of the prestigious journal machine learning research this conversation is part of the artificial intelligence podcast at MIT and beyond if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes or simply connect with me on twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fri D and now here's my conversation with Leslie Kael Blaine what made me get excited about AI I can say that as I read girdle Ashur back when I was in high school that was pretty formative for me because it exposed the interestingness of primitives and combination and how you can make complex things out of simple parts and ideas of AI and what kinds of programs might generate intelligent behavior so so you first fell in love with AI reasoning logic versus robots yeah the robots came because my first job so I finished an undergraduate degree in philosophy at Stanford and was about to finish master's in computer science and I got hired at SR I in their AI lab and they were building a robot it was a kind of a follow-on to shaky but all the shaky people were not there anymore and so my job was to try to get this robot to do stuff and that's really kind of what got me interested in robots so maybe taking a small step back your bachelor's in Stanford and philosophy did masters and PhD in computer science but the bachelors in philosophy so what was that journey like what elements of philosophy do you think you bring to your work in computer science so the part of the reason that I didn't do a computer science undergraduate degree was that there wasn't one at Stanford at the time but that there's part of philosophy and in fact Stanford has a special sub major in something called now symbolic systems which is logic model theory formal semantics of natural language and so that's actually a perfect preparation for work in AI and computer science that that's kind of interesting so if you were interested in artificial intelligence what what kind of majors were people even thinking about taking what is it in your science was so besides philosophies what were you supposed to do if you were fascinated by the idea of creating intelligence there weren't enough people who did that for that even to be at conversation okay I mean I think probably probably philosophy I mean it's interesting in my class my graduating class of undergraduate philosophers probably maybe slightly less than half went on in computer science slightly less than half went on in law and like one or two went on in philosophy so it was a common kind of connection do you think AI researchers have a role be part time philosophers or should they stick to the solid science and engineering without sort of taking the philosophizing tangents I mean you work with robots you think about what it takes to create intelligent beings aren't you the perfect person to think about the big picture philosophy of it all the parts of philosophy that are closest to AI I think or at least the closest to AI that I think about are stuff like belief and knowledge and denotation and that kind of stuff and that's you know it's quite formal and it's like just one step away from the kinds of computer science work that we do kind of routinely I think that there are important questions still about what you can do with a machine and what you can't and so on although at least my personal view is that I'm completely a materialist and I don't think that there's any reason why we can't make a robot be behaviorally indistinguishable from a human and the question of whether it's in the distinguishable internally whether it's a zombie or not in philosophy terms I actually don't I don't know and I don't know if I care too much about that right there there's a philosophical notions they're mathematical and philosophical because we don't know so much of how difficult it is how difficult is a perception problem how difficult is the planning problem how difficult is it to operate in this world successfully because our robots are not currently as successful human beings and many tasks the the question about the gap between current robots and human beings borders a little bit on philosophy you know the expanse of knowledge that's required to operate in this world and the ability to form common-sense knowledge the ability to reason about uncertainty much of the work you've been doing there's those open questions there that I don't know require to activate a certain big-picture view to me that doesn't seem like a philosophical gap to me it's a there is a big technical gap yes technical gap but I don't see any reason why it's more than a technical gap perfect so when you mention AI you know sorry and maybe can you describe to me when you first fell in love with robotics with robots or inspired which so you should mention flaky or shaky shaky flaky and what was the robot that first captured your imagination what's possible right well this so the first robot I worked was like shakey was a robot that the SR I people had built but by the time I think when I arrived it was sitting in a corner of somebody's office dripping hydraulic fluid into a pan but its iconic and really everybody should read the shaky tech report because it has so many good ideas in it I mean they invented a star search and symbolic planning and learning macro operators they had the level kind of configuration space planning for the robot they had vision they had all this the basic ideas of a ton of things okay take a step by the shaky have arms that was a job could push objects and so it would move things around with which actuator itself with its base okay so it could but it and they had painted the baseboards black so it used it used vision to localize itself in a map it detected objects it could detect objects that were surprising to it it would plan and re plan based on what it saw it reasoned about whether to look and take pictures I mean it really had the basics of of so many of the things that we think about now how do you represent the space around it so it had representations that are bunch of different levels of abstraction so it had I think a kind of an occupancy grid of some sort at the lowest level at the high level it was abstract symbolic kind of rooms and connectivity it's a word as flaky coming yeah okay so at us RI and we were building a brand-new robot as I said none of the people from the previous project were kind of there or involved anymore so we were kind of starting from scratch and my advisor was Stan resin shine he ended up being my thesis advisor and he was motivated by this idea of situated computation or situated automata and the idea was that the tools of logical reasoning were important but possibly only for the engineers or designers to use in the analysis of a system but not necessarily to be manipulated in the head of the system itself right so I might use logic to prove a theorem about the behavior of my robot even if the robots not using logic and it's headed to prove theorems right so that was kind of the distinction and so the idea was to kind of use those principles to make a robot do stuff but a lot of the basic things we had to kind of learn for ourselves because I had zero background in robotics I didn't know anything about control I don't know anything about sensors so we reinvented a lot of wheels on the way to getting that robot to do stuff do you think that was an advantage or hindrance oh no it's I mean I I'm big in favor of wheel reinvention actually I mean I think you learn a lot by doing it it's important though to eventually have the pointers to so that you can see what's really going on but I think you can appreciate much better the good solutions once you've messed around a little bit on your own and found a bad one yeah I think you mentioned reinventing reinforcement learning yeah and referring to rewards as pleasures by a pleasure yeah I think yeah I think it's a nice name for it it's more it's more fun almost do you think you could tell the history of AI and machine learning reinforcement learning and how you think about it from the 50s to now one thing is that its oscillates right so things become fashionable and then they go out and then something else becomes cool and that it goes out and so on and I think there's so there's some interesting sociological process that actually drives a lot of what's going on early days was kind of cybernetics and control right and the idea that of homeostasis people have made these robots that could I don't know try to plug into the wall when they needed power and then come loose and roll around and do stuff and then I think over time the thought well that was inspiring but people said no no we want to get maybe closer to what feels like real intelligence or human intelligence and then maybe the expert systems people tried to do that but maybe a little too superficially right so oh we get the surface understanding of what intelligence is like because I understand how a steel mill works and I can try to explain it to you and you can write it down in logic and then we can make a computer infer that and then that didn't work out but what's interesting I think is when a thing starts to not be working very well it's not only do we change methods we change problems right so it's not like we have better ways of doing the problem of the experts those people are trying to do we have no ways of trying to do that problem oh yeah I know I think maybe a few but we kind of give up on that problem and we switch to a different problem and we we work that for a while and we I guess there's a broad community as a community and there's a lot of people who would argue you don't give up on the problem it's just you decrease the number of people working on it you almost kind of like put it on the shelf so we'll come back to this 20 years later yeah I think that's right or you might decide that it's malformed like you might say it's wrong to just try to make something that does superficial symbolic reasoning behave like a doctor you can't do that until you've had the sensorimotor experience of being a doctor or something right so there's arguments that say that that's problem was not well formed or it could be that it is well for it but but we just weren't approaching it well you mention that your favorite part of logic and symbolic systems is that they give short names for large sets so there is some use to this they use just as a symbolic reasoning though the looking at expert systems and symbolic computing what do you think are the roadblocks that were hit in the eighties and nineties ah okay so right so the fact that I'm not a fan of expert systems doesn't mean that I'm not a fan of some kinds of symbolic reasoning right so let's see road blocks but the main road block I think was that the idea that humans could articulate their knowledge effectively into into you know some kind of logical statements so it's not just the cost the effort but really just the capability of doing it right because we're all experts in vision right but not totally don't have introspective access into how we do that right and it's true that I mean I think the idea was well of course even people then would know of course I wouldn't ask you to please write down the rules that you use for recognizing water bottle that's crazy and everyone understood that but we might ask you to please write down the rules you use for deciding I don't know what tie to put on or how to set up a microphone or something like that but even those things I think people maybe I think what they found I'm not sure about this but I think what they found was that that so-called experts could give explanations that sort of post hoc explanations for how and why they did things but they weren't necessarily very good and then they different they depended on maybe some kinds of perceptual things which again they couldn't really define very well so I think I think fundamentally I think that the underlying problem with that was the assumption that people could articulate how and why they make their decisions all right so it's almost in call encoding the knowledge from converting from expert to something that a machine could understand and reason with no no not even just encoding but getting it out of you just not not writing it I mean yes hard also to write it down for the computer yeah but I don't think that but can produce it you can tell me a story about why you do stuff but I'm not so sure that's the way great so there are still on the hierarchical planning side places where symbolic reasoning is very useful so as you've talked about so where so don't where's the gap yeah okay good so saying that humans can't provide a description of their reasoning processes that's ok fine but that doesn't mean that it's not good to do reasoning of various styles inside a computer those are just two orthogonal points so then the question is what kind of reasoning should you do inside a computer right and the answer is I think you need to do all different kinds of reasoning inside a computer depending on what kinds of problems you face I guess the question is what kind of things can you encode symbolically so you can reason about I think the idea about an even symbolic I don't even like that terminology because I don't know what it means technically informally I do believe in abstractions so abstractions are critical right you cannot reason a completely fine grain about everything in your life right you can't make a plan at the level of images and torques for getting a PhD right so you have to reduce the size of the state space and you have to reduce the horizon if you're gonna reason about getting a PhD or even buying the ingredients to make dinner and so so how can you reduce the spaces and the horizon of the reasoning you have to do and the answer is abstraction spatial abstraction temporal abstraction I think abstraction along the lines of goals is also interesting like you might or well abstraction and decomposition goals this may be more of a decomposition thing so I think that's where these kinds of if you want to call it symbolic or discrete models come in you you talk about a room of your house instead of your pose you talk about you know doing something during the afternoon instead of at 2:54 and you do that because it makes your reasoning problem easier and also because you have you don't have enough information to reason in high fidelity about your pose of your elbow at 2:35 this afternoon anyway right when you're trying to get a PhD okay except for at that moment at that moment you do have to use it about the pose of your elbow maybe but then you maybe you do that in some continuous joint space kind of modeling so I again I my biggest point about all of this is that there should be the dogma is not the thing right we shouldn't it shouldn't be that I'm in favor against symbolic reasoning and you're in favor against neural networks it should be that just just computer science tells us what the right answer to all these questions is smart enough to figure it out oh yeah when you try to actually solve the problem with computers the right answer comes out you mentioned abstractions mm-hmm I mean you all networks form abstractions or rather there's there's automated ways to form strategies and there's expert driven ways to form abstractions and export human driven ways and humans just seems to be way better at forming abstractions currently and certain problems so when you're referring to 2:45 and PM versus afternoon how do we construct that taxonomy is there any room for automated construction of such abstractions oh I think eventually yeah I mean I think when we get to be better and machine learning engineers will build algorithms that build awesome abstractions that are useful in this kind of way that you describe yeah yeah so let's then step from the the abstraction discussion and let's talk about BOM mdps partially observable Markov decision processes so uncertainty so first water Markov decision processes and maybe how much of our world could be models and mdps how much when you wake up in them morning me making breakfast how do you think of yourself as an MDP so how do you think about MVPs and how they relate to our world well so there's a stance question right so a stance is a position that I take with respect to a problem so I as a researcher or person who design systems can decide to make a model of the world around me in some terms right so I take this messy world and I say I'm gonna treat it as if it were a problem of this formal kind and then I can apply solution concepts around rhythms or whatever to solve that formal thang right so of course the world is not anything it's not an MDP or a pom DP I don't know what it is but I can model aspects of it in some way or some other way and when I model some aspect of it in a certain way that gives me some set of algorithms I can use you can model the world in all kinds of ways some have some are more accepting of uncertainty more easily modeling uncertainty of the world some really force the world to be deterministic and so the certainly NDP's model the uncertainty of the world yes model some uncertainty the model not present state uncertainty but they model uncertainty in the way the future will unfold right so what are Markov decision process so marketers process is a model it's a kind of model that you could make that says I I know completely the current state of my system and what it means to be a state is that I that all they have all the information right now that will let me make predictions about the future as well as I can so that remembering anything about my history wouldn't make my predictions any better and but it but then it also says that that then I can take some actions that might change the state of the world and that I don't have a deterministic model of those changes I have a probabilistic model of how the world might change it's a it's a useful model for some kinds of systems I think it's a I mean it's certainly not a good model for most problems I think because for most problems you don't actually know State for most problems you it's partially observed so that's now a different problem class so okay that's where the poverty P is the partially observable Markov decision process step n so how do they address the fact that you can't observe most your incomplete information about most of the world around you right so now the idea is we still kind of postulate that there exists a state we think that there is some information about the world out there such that if we knew that we could make good predictions but we don't know the state and so then we have to think about how but we do get observations maybe I get images right here things are I feel things and those might be local or noisy and so therefore they don't tell me everything about what's going on and then I have to reason about given the history of actions I've taken in observations I've gotten what do I think is going on in the world and then given my own kind of uncertainty about what's going on in the world I can decide what actions to take and so difficult is this problem of planning under uncertainty in your view and you know long experience of modeling the world trying to deal with this uncertainty in special and real of all systems optimal planning for even discrete hamdi peas can be undecidable depending on how you set it up and free so lots of people say I don't use pom D peas because they are intractable and I think that that's are kind of a very funny thing to say because the problem you have to solve is the problem you have to solve so if the problem you have to solve is intractable that's what makes us AI people right so we saw we understand that the problem we're solving is is compute wildly intractable that we can't we will never be able to solve it optimally at least I don't yeah right so later we can come back to an idea about bounded optimality and something but anyway I don't we can't come up with optimal solutions to these problems so we have to make approximations approximations in modeling approximations in the solution algorithms and so on and so I don't have a problem with saying yeah my problem actually it is pom DP in continuous space with continuous observations and it's so computationally complex I can't even think about it's you know Big O whatever but that doesn't prevent me from it helps me gives me some clarity to think about it that way and to then take steps to make approximation after approximation to get down to something that's like computable in some reasonable time when you think about optimality you know the community broadly is shifted on that I think a little bit in how much they value the idea of optimality of chasing an optimal solution positive views of chasing an optimal solution changed over the years and when you work with robots that's interesting I think we have a little bit of a methodological crisis actually from the theoretical side I mean I do think that theory is important in that right now we're not doing much of it so there's lots of empirical hacking around and training this and doing that and reporting numbers but is it good is it bad we don't know we very hard to say things and if you look at like computer science theory so people talked for a while everyone was about solving problems optimally or completely and and then there were interesting relaxation so people look at oh can I are their regret bounds or can I do some kind of you know approximation can I prove something that I can approximately solve this problem or that I get closer to the solution as I spend more time and so on what's interesting I think is that we don't have good approximate solution concepts for very difficult problems right I like to you know I like to say that I I'm interested in doing a very bad job of very big problems but I would I wish I could say something I wish I had a I don't know some kind of a formal solution concept that I could use to say oh this this algorithm actually it gives me something like I know what I'm gonna get I can do something other than just run it and get out so that having that notion is still somewhere deeply compelling to you the notion that you can say you can drop thing on the table says this you can expect this this out gonna give me some good results I hope science will I mean there's engineering in there science I think that they're not exactly the same and I think right now we're making huge engineering like leaps and bounds so that engineering is running away ahead of the science which is cool and often how it goes right so we're making things and nobody knows how and why they work roughly but we need to turn that into science there's some form it's yeah there's some room for formalizing we need to know what the principles are why does this work why does that not work I mean for awhile people built bridges by trying but now we can often predict whether it's going to work or not without building it can we do that for learning systems or for robots so your hope is from a materialistic perspective that intelligence artificial intelligence systems robots okay I were just more fancier bridges believe space what's the difference between belief space and state space I mentioned MDPs fond appease you reasoning about you sense the world there's a state what's this belief space idea I believe space that is instead of thinking about what's the state of the world and trying to control that as a robot I think about what is the space of beliefs that I could have about the world what's if I think of a belief as a probability distribution over ways the world could be a belief state is a distribution and then my control problem if I'm reasoning about how to move through a world I'm uncertain about my control problem is actually the problem of controlling my beliefs so I think about taking actions not just what effect they'll have on the world outside but what effect I'll have on my own understanding of the world outside and so that might compel me to ask a question or look somewhere to gather information which may not really change the world state but it changes my own belief about the world that's a powerful way to to empower the agent to reason about the world to explore the world what kind of problems does it allow you to solve to to consider belief space versus just state space well any problem that requires deliberate information gathering right so if in some problems like chess there's no uncertainty or maybe there's uncertainty about the opponent there's no uncertainty about the state and some problems there's uncertainty but you gather information as you go right you might say oh I'm driving my autonomous car down the road and it doesn't know perfectly where it is but the Llyod ours are all going all the time so I don't have to think about whether to gather information but if you're a human driving down the road you sometimes look over your shoulder to see what's going on behind you in the lane and you have to side whether you should do that now and you have to trade off the fact that you're not seeing in front of you and you're looking behind you and how valuable is that information and so on and so to make choices about information gathering you have to reasonably spaced also also I mean also to just take into account your own uncertainty before trying to do things so you might say if I understand where I'm standing relative to the door jamb pretty accurately then it's okay for me to go through the door but if I'm really not sure where the door is then it might be better to not do that right now the degree of your uncertainty ball about the world is actually part of the thing you're trying to optimize in forming the plan right so this idea of a long horizon of planning for a PhD or just even how to get out of the house or how to make breakfast you show this presentation of the the WTF was the fork of robot looking at a sink and can you describe how we plan in this world of this idea of hierarchical planning we've mentioned this is a yeah how can a robot hope to plan about something this was such a long hallway people since probably reasoning began have thought about hierarchical reasoning the temporal hierarchy and particular spatial hierarchy but let's talk about temporal hierarchy so you might say oh I have this long execution I have to do but I can divide it into some segments abstractly right so maybe you have to get out of house I have to get in the car I have to drive so on and so you can plan if you can build abstractions so this we started out by talking about abstractions and we're back to that now if you can build abstractions in your state space and abstractions sort of temporal abstractions then you can make plans at a high level and you can say I'm gonna go to town and then I'll have to get gas and then I can go here and I can do this other thing and you can reason about the dependencies and constraints among these actions again without thinking about the complete details what we do in our hierarchical planning work is then say alright I make a plan at a high level of abstraction I have to have some reason to think that it's feasible without working it out in complete detail and that's actually the interesting step I always like to talk about walking through an airport like you can plan to go to New York and arrive at the airport and then find yourself in an office building later you can't even tell me in advance what your plan is for walking through the airport partly because you're too lazy to think about it maybe but partly also because you just don't have the information you don't know what gate you're landing in or what people are gonna be in front of you or anything so there's no point in planning in detail but you have to have you have to make a leap of faith that you can figure it out once you get there and it's really interesting to me how you arrive at that how do you they say you have learned over your lifetime to be able to make some kinds of predictions about how hard it is to achieve some kinds of sub goals and that's critical like you would never plan to fly somewhere if you couldn't didn't have a model of how hard it was to do some of the intermediate steps so one of the things we're thinking about now is how do you do this kind of very aggressive generalization to situations that you haven't been in and so on to predict how long will it take to walk through the Kuala Lumpur Airport like you give me an estimate and it wouldn't be crazy and you have to have an estimate of that in order to make plans that involve walking through the Kuala Lumpur Airport even if you don't need to know it in detail so I'm really interested in these kinds of abstract models and how do we acquire them but once we have them we can use them to do hierarchical reasoning which is I think it's very important yeah there's this notion of gold' regression and preimage back chaining this idea of starting at the goal and it's just for these big clouds of states you get I mean it's almost like saying to the airport you know you you know once you show up to the airport that that's you you're like a few steps away from the goal so like thinking of it this way it's kind of interesting I don't know if you have sort of further comments on them of starting at the goal why that yeah I mean it's interesting that Simon herb Simon back in the early days of AI did talked a lot about means-ends reasoning and reasoning back from the goal there's a kind of an intuition that people have that the number of that state space is big the number of actions you could take is really big so if you say here I sit and I want to search forward from where I am what are all the things I could do that's just overwhelming if you say if you can reason at this other level and say here's what I'm hoping to achieve what can I do to make that true that somehow the branching is smaller now what's interesting is that like in the AI planning community that hasn't worked out in the class of problems that they look at and the methods that they tend to use it hasn't turned out that it's better to go backward it's still kind of my intuition that it is but I can't prove that to you right now all right I'd share your intuition at least for us mere humans speaking of which when you maybe never take it and take a look take a little step into that philosophy circle how hard would it when you think about human life you should give those examples often how hard do you think it is to formulate human life is a planning problem or aspects of human life so when you look at robots you're often trying to think about object manipulation tasks about moving a thing when you when you take a slight step outside the room let the robot leave and go get lunch or maybe try to pursue more fuzzy goals how hard do you think is that problem if you were to try to maybe put another way try to formulate human life as a planning problem well that would be a mistake I mean it's not all the planning problem right every think it's really really important that we understand that you have to put together pieces and parts that have different styles of reasoning representation and learning I think I think it's it's seems probably clear to anybody that that you you can't all be this or all be that brains aren't all like this are all like that right they have different pieces and parts and substructure and so on so I don't think that there's any good reason to think that there's going to be like one true algorithmic thing that's gonna do the whole job just a bunch of pieces together designed to solve a bunch of specific problem one the specific styles of problems I mean there's probably some reasoning that needs to go on in image space I think again there's this model based vs. model free idea it's I only enforce spent learning people talk about it oh should I learn I could learn a policy just straight up a way of behaving I could learn it's popularly a value function that's some kind of weird intermediate ground or I could learn a transition model or it tells me something about the dynamics of the world if I take a trip if imagine that I learned in a transition model and I couple it with a planner and I draw a box around that I have a policy again it's just stored a different way right right it's in but it's just as much of a policy as the other policy it's just I've made I think the way I see it is it's a time-space trade-off in computation right a more overt policy representation maybe it takes more space but maybe I can compute quickly what action I should take on the other hand maybe a very compact model of the world dynamics plus a planner let's make compute what action to take to just more slowly there's no I mean I don't think there's no argument to be had it's just like a question of what form of computation is best for us for the various subproblems right so and and so like learning to do algebra manipulations for some reason is good I mean that's probably gonna want naturally is sort of a different representation than riding a unicycle at the time constraints on the unicycle or serious this thing space is maybe smaller I don't know but so I could be the more human-sized of falling in love having a relationship that might be another yeah another style of no idea how to model that yeah that's let's first solve the algebra an object may patient what do you think is harder perception or planning perception that's understanding that's so what do you think is so hard about perception by understanding the world around you well I think the big question is representational a hugely the question is representation so perception has made great strides lately right and we can classify images and we can play certain kinds of games of predict I to steer in the car and all this sort of stuff I don't think we have a very good idea of what perception should deliver right so if you if you believe in modularity ok there's there's a very strong view which says we shouldn't build in any modularity we should make a giant gigantic neural network trained it end-to-end to do the thing and that's the best way forward and it's hard to argue with that except on a sample complexity basis right so you might say oh well if I want to do end-to-end Rio first of all anything on this giant giant neural network it's going to take a lot of data and a lot of like broken robot system so then the only answer is to say ok we have to build something in build in some structure or some bias we know from theory of machine learning the only way to cut down the sample complexity is to kind of cut down somehow cut down the hypothesis space you can do that by building in bias there's all kinds of reason to think that nature built bias into humans [Music] convolution is a bias right it's a very strong bias and it's a very critical bias so my own view is that we should look for more things that are like convolution but that other aspects of reasoning right so convolution helps us a lot with a certain kind of spatial reasoning that's quite close to the imaging I think there's other ideas like that maybe some amount of forward search maybe some notions of abstraction maybe the notion that objects exist actually I think that's pretty important and a lot of people won't give you that to start with right so almost like a convolution in the in the object semantic object space of some kind sometimes some kind of ideas in there that's right people who started like the graph graph convolutions are an idea that are related to racial relational representations and so so I think there are so you I've come far afield from perception but I think I think the thing that's going to make perception that kind of the next step is actually understanding better what it should produce right so what are we going to do with the output of it right it's fine when what we're gonna do with the output is Sudhir it's less clear when we're just trying to make a one integrated intelligent agent what should the output of perception be we have no idea and how should that hook up to the other stuff we don't know so I think the pressing question is what kinds of structure can we build in that are like the moral equivalent of convolution that will make a really awesome super structure that then learning can kind of progress on efficiently I agree very compelling description of actually where we stand with the perceptual mom you're teaching a course on embodying intelligence what do you think it takes to build a robot with human level intelligence I don't know if we knew we would do it if you were to I mean okay so do you think a robot needs to have a self-awareness consciousness fear of mortality or is it is it simpler than that or is consciousness a simple thing like do you think about these notions I don't think much about consciousness even most philosophers who care about it will give you that you could have that are zombies right that behave like humans but are not conscious and I at this moment we'd be happy enough for that so I'm not really worried one way or the other to the technical side you're not thinking of the use of self-awareness no but okay but then what is self-awareness mean I mean that you need to have some part of the system that can observe other parts of the system and tell whether they're working well or not that seems critical so does that count this I mean does that kind of self-awareness or not well it depends on whether you think that there's somebody at home who can articulate whether they're self-aware but clearly if I have like you know some piece of code that's counting how many times this procedure gets executed that's a kind of self-awareness right so there's a big spectrum it's clear you have to have some of it right you know quite far away at many dimensions but there's a direction of research that's most compelling to you for you know try to achieve human-level intelligence in our robots well to me I guess the thing that seems most compelling to me at the moment is this question of what to build in and what to learn I think we're we don't we're missing a bunch of ideas and and we you know people you know don't you dare ask me how many years it's gonna be until that happens because I won't even participate in the conversation because I think we're missing ideas and I don't know how long it's gonna take to find them so I won't ask you how many years but maybe I'll ask you what it when you'll be sufficiently impressed that we've achieved it so what's what's a good test of intelligence do you like the Turing test the natural language in the robotic space is there something wait you would sit back and think us that's pretty impressive as a test as a benchmark do you think about these kinds of problems no I resist I mean I think all the time that we spend arguing about those kinds of things could be better spent just making the robots work better so you competition so I mean there's a nature of benchmark benchmarks and data sets or touring test challenges or everybody kind of gets together and tries to build a better robot because they want to compete each other like the DARPA challenge with the autonomous vehicles do you see the value of that I can get in the way I think in the way I mean some people many people find it motivating and so that's good I find it anti motivating but I think I mean I think you get an interesting cycle where for a contest a bunch of smart people get super motivated and they hack the brains out and much of what gets done is just hacks but sometimes really cool ideas emerge and then that gives us something to chew on after that so I'm it's not a thing for me but I don't I don't regret that other people do it yeah it's like he says with everything else that makes is good so jumping topics a little bit he started the journal of machine learning research and served as its editor-in-chief how did the publication come about and what do you think about the current publishing model space and machine learning artificial intelligence ok good so it came about because there was a journal called machine learning which still exists which was owned by Kluwer and there was I was on the editorial board and we used to have these meetings and really where we would complain to Kluwer that it was too expensive for the libraries and that people couldn't publish and we would really like to have some kind of relief on those friends and they would always sympathize but not do anything so we just decided to make a new journal and there was the Journal of AI research which has was on the same model which had been and exists us for maybe five years or so and it was going on pretty well so uh we just made a new journal it wasn't I mean they don't know I guess it was work but it wasn't that hard so basically the editorial board probably 75% of the editorial board of machine learning resigned and we founded the Neuse new journal but it was sort of it was more open yeah right so it's completely open its open access actually I I had a postdoc George Kennedy artists who wanted to call these journals free for all because there were I mean it both has no page charges and has no access restrictions and the reason and so lots of people I mean there were there were people who are mad about the existence of this journal who thought it was a fraud or something it would be impossible they said to run a journal like this with basically I mean for a long time I didn't even have a bank account I paid for the lawyer to incorporate and the IP address and it cost a couple hundred dollars a year to run it's a little bit more now but not that much more but that's because I think computer scientists are competent and autonomous in a way that many scientists and other fields aren't I mean at doing these kinds of things we already typeset around papers we all have students and people who can hack a website together in an afternoon so the infrastructure for us was like not a problem but for other people in other fields it's a harder thing to do yeah and this kind of open access journal and there's nevertheless one of the most prestigious journals so it's not like a prestige and it can be achieved without any other paper it's not required yeah for prestige it turns out yeah so on the review process side of actually a long time ago I don't remember when I reviewed a paper where you were also a reviewer and I remember reading your if you were being influenced by it and it was really well-written it influenced how I write future reviews you disagreed with me actually and you made it my review but much better so I but nevertheless the review process you know has its flaws and how do you think what do you think works well how can it be improved so actually when I started Djamel our I wanted to do something completely different and I didn't because it felt like we needed a traditional Journal of record and so we just made jam art be almost like a normal Journal except for the open-access parts of it basically increasingly of course publication is not even a sensible word you can publish something about putting it in archives that I can publish everything tomorrow so making stuff public is there's no barrier we still need curation and evaluation I don't have time to read all of our kyv and you could argue that kind of social thumbs up being of articles suffice is right you might say oh heck with this we don't need journals at all we'll put everything on archive and people will upload and down about the articles and then your CV will say oh man they he got a lot of buzz so that's good but I think there's still value in careful reading and commentary of things and it's hard to tell when people are voting and down voting or arguing about your paper on Twitter and reddit whether they know what they're talking about right so then I have the second order problem of trying to decide whose opinions I should value and such so I don't know I what I if I had infinite time which I don't and I'm not gonna do this because I really want to make robots work but if I felt inclined to do something more in a publication direction I would do this other thing which I thought about doing the first time which is to get together some set of people whose opinions I value and who were pretty articulate and I guess we would be public although we could be private I'm not sure and we would review papers we wouldn't publish them and you wouldn't submit them we were just fine papers and we would write reviews and we would make those reviews public and maybe if you you know so we're Leslie's friends who review papers and maybe eventually if if we are opinion was officially valued like the opinion of Jay mor is valued then you'd say in your CV that Leslie's friends gave my paper a five-star reading and that would be just as good as saying I got it so you know accepted into this journal so I think I think we should have good public commentary and organize it in some way but I don't really know how to do it it's interesting at times the way the way you describe text is really interesting and you would do it for movies IMDB done know there's experts critics come in they write reviews but there's also regular yeah non critics humans write reviews and they're separated I like open review the the eye I cleared process I think is interesting it's a step in the right direction but it's still not as compelling as reviewing movies or video games I mean it sometimes almost it might be silly it's my perspective to say but it boils down to the user interface how fun and easy it is to actually perform the reviews how efficient how much you as a reviewer get street cred for being a good reviewer those element those human elements come into play now it's a big investment to do a good review of a paper and the flood of papers is that control right so you know there aren't 3,000 new I don't know how many new movies are there any year I don't know but that's probably gonna be less than how many machine learning papers are in a year now and I'm worried I you know I I and right so I'm like an old person so of course I'm gonna say rawrrr things are moving too fast I'm a stick in the mud so I can say that but my particular flavor of that is I think the horizon for researchers has gotten very short that students want to publish a lot of papers and there's a huge there's value it's exciting and there's value in that and you get patted on the head for it and so on but and some of that is fine but I'm worried that we're driving out people who would spend two years thinking about something back in my day when we worked on our theses we did not publish papers you did your thesis for years you picked a hard problem and then you worked and chewed on it and did stuff and wasted time and a long time and when it was roughly when it was done you would write papers and so I I don't know how to inside and I don't think that everybody has to work in that mode but I think there's some problems that are hard enough that it's important to have a longer her research horizon and I'm worried though we don't incentivize that at all at this point in this current structure right so what do you see as what are your hopes and fears about the future of AI and continuing this theme so AI has gone through a few winters ups and downs do you see another winter of AI coming are you more hopeful about making robots work as he said I think the cycles are inevitable but I think each time we we get higher right I mean so you know it's like climbing some kind of landscape with a noisy optimizer yeah so it's clear that the the you know the deep learning stuff has made deep and important improvements and so the high-water mark is now higher I there's no question but of course I think people are over sawing and eventually investors I guess and other people look around and say well you're not quite delivering on this grand claim and that wild hypothesis it's so probably it's going to crash them out and then it's okay I mean but I don't I can't imagine that there's like some awesome monotonic improvement from here to human level III so in you know I have to ask this question I probably anticipate answers the answers but do you have a worry short term and long term about the existential threats of AI and maybe short-term less existential but more robots taking away jobs actually let me talk a little bit about utility actually I had an interesting conversation with some military ethicists who wanted to talk to me about autonomous weapons and there they were interesting smart well-educated guys who didn't know too much about AI are machine learning and the first question they asked me was has your robot ever done something you didn't expect and I like burst out laughing because anybody who's ever done something other robot right knows that they don't do it and what I realized was that their model of how we program a robot was completely wrong their model of how we can put program robot was like Lego Mindstorms like oh go for it a meter turn left take a picture do this do that and so if you have that model of programming then it's true it's kind of weird that your robot would do something that you didn't anticipate but the fact is and and actually so now this is my new educational mission if I have to talk to non experts I try to teach them the idea that we don't operate we operate at least one or maybe many levels of abstraction about that and we say oh here's a hypothesis class maybe it's a space of plans or maybe it's a space of classifiers or whatever but there's some set of answers and an objective function and then we work on some optimization method that tries to optimize a solution a solution in that class and we don't know what solution that's going to come out right so I think it's important to communicate that so I read of course probably people who listen to this they they know that lesson but I think it's really critical to communicate that lesson and then lots of people are now talking about you know the value alignment problem so you want to be sure as robots or software systems get more competent that their objectives are aligned with your objectives or that our objectives are compatible in some way or we have a good way of mediating when they have different objectives and so I think it is important to start thinking in terms like you don't have to be freaked out by the robot apocalypse - except that it's important to think about objective functions of value alignment yes and that you have to really everyone who's done optimization knows that you have to be careful what you wish for that ah you know sometimes you get the optimal solution and you realize man that was that objective was wrong so pragmatically in the shortest term it seems to me that that those are really interesting and critical questions and the idea that we're gonna go from being people who engineer algorithms to being people who engineer objective functions I think that's that's definitely going to happen and that's gonna change our thinking and methodology and we're gonna you started at Stanford philosophy that's where she comes I will go back to because as we also know as machine learning people right when you're design in fact this is the lecture I gave in class today when you design an objective function you have to worry about with hats there's the Hat that says what do I want and there's the hat that says but I know what my optimizer can do to some degree and I have to take that into account okay so it's it's always a trade-off and we have to kind of be mindful of that the part about taking people's jobs I understand that that's important I don't understand sociology or economics or people very well so I don't know how to think about that so that's yeah so there might be a sociological aspect there the economical aspect that's very difficult to say well okay I mean I think other people should be thinking about it but I'm just that's not my strength so what do you think is the most exciting area of research in the short term for the community and for your for yourself well so I mean there's the story I've been telling about how to engineer intelligent robots so that's what we want to do we all kind of want to do well I mean some set of us want to do this and the question is what's the most effective strategy and we've tried and there's a bunch of different things you could do at the extremes right one super extreme is we do introspection then we write a program okay that has not worked out very well another extreme is we take a giant bunch of neural and we trying to train it up to do something I don't think that's gonna work either so the question is what's the middle ground and and again this isn't a theological question or anything like that it's just like going how do just how do we what's the best way to make this work out and I think it's clear it's a combination of learning to me it's clear it's a combination of learning and not learning and what should that combination be and what's the stuff we built in so to me that's the most compelling question and when you say engineer robots you mean engineering systems that work in the real world is that that's the emphasis last question which robots or robot is your favorite from science fiction so you can go with Star Wars Arthur r2d2 or you can go with more modern maybe Hal this is this is back to you like to make robots work in the real world here not Madden I mean I love the process and I care more about the process engineering process yeah I mean I do research because it's fun not because I care about what we produce well that's a that's a beautiful note actually to end on Leslie thank you so much for talking today sure it's been fun you
