 the following is a conversation with Daphne Koller a professor of computer science at Stanford University a co-founder of Coursera with Andrew Eng and founder and CEO of in seat row a company at the intersection of machine learning and biomedicine we're now in the exciting early days of using the data-driven methods of machine learning to help discover and develop new drugs and treatments at scale Daphne and in seat row are leading the way on this with breakthroughs they may ripple through all fields of medicine including ones most critical for helping with a current coronavirus pandemic this conversation was recorded before the cove 8:19 outbreak for everyone feeling the medical psychological and financial burden of this crisis I'm sending love your way stay strong we're in this together we'll beat this thing this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe I need to review it with five stars an apple podcast supported on patreon are simply connected me on Twitter Alex Friedman spelled Fri D ma M as usual I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of this conversation I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience this show is presented by cash app the number-one finance app in the App Store when you get it used collects podcast cash app lets you send money to friends buy Bitcoin and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar since ketchup allows you to send and receive money digitally peer-to-peer and security in all digital transactions is very important and you mentioned that PCI data security standard the cash shop is compliant with I'm a big fan of standards for safety and security PCI DSS is a good example of that where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions now we just need to do the same for Thomas vehicles and the ad systems in general so again if you get cash app from the App Store Google Play and use the code luxe podcast you get ten dollars in cash that will also donate ten dollars to first an organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world and now here's my conversation with Daphne Koller so you co-founded Coursera I made a huge impact in the global education of AI and after five years in August 2016 wrote a blog post saying that you're stepping away and wrote quote it's time for me to turn to another critical challenge the development of machine learning and it's applications to improving human health so let me ask two far-out philosophical questions one do you think will one day find cures for all major diseases known today and two do you think will one day figure out a way to extend the human lifespan perhaps to the point of immortality so one day is a very long time and I don't like to make predictions of the type we will never be able to do X because I think that's a you know that's the smacks of hubris it seems that never and in in in the entire eternity of human existence will we be able to solve a problem that being said curing disease is very hard because oftentimes by the time you discover the disease a lot of damage has already been done and so to assume that we would be able to cure disease at that stage assumes that we would come up with ways is basically regenerating entire parts of the human body in the way that actually returns it to its original state and that's a very challenging problem we have cured very few diseases we've been able to provide treatment for an increasingly large number but the number of things that you could actually define to be cures is actually not that large so I think that's it there's a lot of work that would need to happen for one could legitimately say that we have cured even a reasonable number of far less all diseases on the scale of 0 to 100 where are we in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of all major diseases what's your sense so from the computer science perspective that you've entered the world of health how far along are we I think it depends on which disease I mean there are ones where I would say we're maybe not quite at a hundred because biology is really complicated and there's always new things that we uncover that people didn't even realize existed so but I would say there's diseases where we might be in the seventies or eighties and then there's diseases in which I would say probably the majority where we're really close to zero with Alzheimer's and schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes fall closer to zero or to the 80 I think Alzheimer's is probably closer to zero than to 80 there are hypotheses but I don't think those hypotheses have as of yet been sufficiently validated that we believe them to be true and there is an increasing number of people who believe there's a traditional hypotheses might not really explain what's going on I would also say that Alzheimer's and schizophrenia and in even type 2 diabetes are not really one disease they're almost certainly a heterogeneous collection of mechanisms that manifests in clinically similar ways so in the same way that we now understand that breast cancer is really not one disease it is multitude of cellular mechanisms all of which ultimately translate to uncontrolled proliferation but it's not one disease the same is almost undoubtedly true for those other diseases as well that understanding that needs to precede any understanding of the specific mechanisms of any of those other diseases now in schizophrenia I would say we're almost certainly closer to zero than to anything else type 2 diabetes is a bit of a mix there are clear mechanisms that are implicated that I think have been validated they have to do with insulin resistance and such but there's almost certainly there as well many mechanisms that we have not yet understood you've also thought and worked a little bit on the longevity side do you see the disease and longevity as overlapping completely partially or not at all as efforts those mechanisms are certainly overlapping there's a well-known phenomenon that says that for most diseases other than childhood diseases the risk for getting for contracting that disease increases exponentially year-on-year every year from the time you're about 40 so obviously there is a connection between those two things I that's not to say that they're identical there's clearly aging that happens that is not really associated with any specific disease and there's also diseases and mechanisms of disease that are not specifically related to aging so I think overlap is where we're at okay it is a little unfortunate that would get older and it seems that there's some correlation with the fact the the occurrence of diseases or the fact that we'll get all there mm-hmm and both are quite sad I mean there's processes that happen as cells age that I think are contributing to disease some of those have to do with the DNA damage that accumulates the cells divide where the repair mechanisms don't fully it correct for those there are accumulations of proteins that are misfolded and potentially aggregate and those two contributes a disease and contribute to inflammation there is an um there's a multitude of mechanisms that have been uncovered that are sort of wear and tear at the cellular level that contribute to disease processes that and I'm sure there's many that we don't yet understand on a small tangent perhaps philosophical this uh the the fact that things get older and the fact that things die is a very powerful feature for the growth of new things that you know it's a learning it's a kind of learning mechanism so it's both tragic and beautiful so do you do you do you so in you know in trying to fight disease and trying to fight aging do you think about sort of the useful fact of our mortality or would you like what if you were could be immortal would you choose to be immortal again I think immortal is a very long time I don't know that that would necessarily be something that I would want to aspire to but I think all of us aspire to an increased health span I would say which is an increased amount of time where you're healthy and active and feel as you did when you were 20 and we're nowhere close to that people deteriorate physically and mentally over time and that is a very sad phenomenon so I think a wonderful aspiration would be if we could all live to you know the biblical 120 may be in perfect health in my quality of life high quality of life I think that would be an amazing goal for us to achieve as a society now is the right age 120 or 100 or 150 I think that's up for debate but I think an increased health span is a really worthy goal and anyway in a grand time the age of the universe it's all pretty short so from the perspective you've done obviously a lot of incredible work on machine learning so what role do you think data and machine learning play in this and his goal of trying to understand diseases in trying to eradicate diseases up until now I don't think it's played very much of a significant role because largely the data sets that one really needed to enable a powerful machine learning methods those data sets haven't really existed there's been dribs and drabs and some interesting machine learning that has been applied I would say machine learning / data science but the last few years are starting to change thoughts so we now see an increase in some large data set but equally importantly an increase in technologies that are able to produce data at scale it's not typically the case that people have deliberately proactively used those tools for the purpose of generating data for machine learning they to the extent that those techniques have been used for data production they've been used for data production to drive scientific discovery and the machine learning came as a sort of by-product second stage of oh you know now we have a data set let's do machine learning on that rather than a more simplistic data analysis method but what we are doing it in seat rows actually flipping that around and saying here's this incredible repertoire of methods that bile engineers cell biologists have come up with let's see if we can put them together in brand-new ways with the goal of creating data sets that machine learning can really be applied on productively to create powerful predictive models that can help us address fundamental problems in human health so really focus to get make data the the primary focus and the primary goal and find use the mechanisms of biology and chemistry to to uh to create the kinds of data set that could allow a machine learning to benefit the most I wouldn't put it in those terms because that says the data is the end goal data's the means so for us the end goal is helping address challenges in human health and the method that we've elected to do that is to apply machine learning to build predictive models and machine learning in my opinion can only be really successfully applied especially the more powerful models if you give it data that is of sufficient scale and sufficient quality so how do you create those data sets so as to drive the ability to generate predictive models which subsequently help improve human health so before we dive into the details of that even take a step back and ask when and where was your interest in human health born are there moments events perhaps if I may ask tragedies in your own life that catalyzes passion or was at the broader desire to help humankind so I would say it's a bit of both so on I mean my interest in human health actually dates back to the early 2000s when when a lot of my peers and machine learning and I were using datasets that frankly we're not very inspiring some of us old-timers still remember the quote-unquote twenty newsgroups dataset where it was literally a bunch of text from twenty newsgroups a concept that doesn't really even exist anymore and the question was can you classify which which news group a particular bag of words came from and it wasn't very interesting the datasets at the time on the biology side were much more interesting both from a technical and also from an aspirational perspective they were still pretty small but they were better than 20 news groups and so I started out I think just by just by wanting to do something that was more I don't know societally useful and technically interesting and then over time became more and more interested in the biology in the and the human health aspects for themselves and began to work even sometimes on papers that were just in biology without having a significant machine learning component I think my interest in drug discovery is partly due to an incident I had with when my father sadly passed away about 12 years ago he had an autoimmune disease that settled in his lungs and the doctors basis it well there was only one thing we could do which is give him prednisone at some point I remember doctor even came and said hey let's do a lung biopsy to figure out which autoimmune disease he has and I said would that be helpful would that change treatments no there's only prednisone that's the only thing we can give him and I have friends who were rheumatologist who said the FDA would never approve press his own today because the ratio of side effects to benefit is probably not large enough today we're in a state where there's probably four or five maybe even more well depends for which autoimmune disease but there are multiple drugs that can help people with autoimmune disease and many of which can exist at 12 years ago and I think we're at a golden time in some ways and drug discovery where there's the ability to create drugs that are much more safe for much more effective than we've ever been able to before and what's lacking is enough understanding of biology and mechanism to know where to aim that weird ain't that engine and I think that's where machine learning can help so in 2018 he started and now lead a company in seat row which is a like you mentioned perhaps the focus is drug discovery and the utilization of machine learning for drug discovery so you mentioned that quote we're really interested in creating what you might call a disease in a dish model disease in a dish models places where disease is a complex where we really haven't had a good model system or typical animal models that have been used for years including testing on mice just aren't very effective so can you can you try to describe what is an animal model and what what is a disease in a dish model sure so an animal models for disease is where you create effectively its what it sounds like it's it's a oftentimes a mouse where we have introduced some external perturbation that creates the disease and then we cure that disease and the hope is that by doing that we will cure a similar disease in human the problem is is that oftentimes the way in which we generate the disease and the animal has nothing to do with how that disease actually comes about in a human it's what you might think of as a copy of the of phenotype a copy of the clinical outcome but the mechanisms are quite different and so curing the disease in the animal which in most cases doesn't happen naturally mice don't get Alzheimer's they don't get diabetes they don't get atherosclerosis they don't get autism or schizophrenia those cures don't translate over to what happens in the human and that's where most drugs fails just because the findings that we had in the mouse don't translate to a human the disease in the dish bottles is a fairly new approach it's been enabled by technologies that have not existed for more than five to ten years so for instance the ability for us to take a cell from any one of us you or me revert thats a skin cell to what's called stem cell status which is a what if it was called a pluripotent cell that can then be differentiated into different types of cells so from that flurry potent cell one can create a wax neuron or a lex cardiomyocyte or alexa parasite that has your genetics but that right our cell type and so if there is a genetic burden of disease that would manifest in that particular cell type you might be able to see it by looking at those cells and saying oh that's what potentially sick cells look like versus healthy cells and understand how and then explore what kind of interventions might revert the unhealthy looking cell to a healthy cell now of course curing cells is not the same as curing people and so there's still potentially translate ability gap but at least for diseases that are driven say by human genetics and where the human genetics is what drives the cellular phenotype there is some reason to hope that if we revert those cells in which the disease begins and where the disease is driven by genetics and we can revert that cell back to a healthy state maybe that will help also the more global clinical phenotypes that's really what we're hoping to do that step that backward step I was reading about it the Yamanaka factor yes so think that the reverse step back to stem cells yes I think seems like magic it is I'm honestly before that happened I think very few people would have predicted that to be possible it's amazing can you maybe elaborate is it actually possible like word like how state so this result was maybe like I don't know how many years ago maybe ten years ago was first demonstrated something like that is this how hard is this like how noisy is this backward step it seems quite incredible and cool it is it is incredible and cool it was much more I think finicky and bespoke at the early stages when the discovery was first made but at this point it's become almost industrialized there are what's called contract research organizations vendors that will take a sample from a human and reverted back to stem cell status and it works a very good fraction of the time now there are people who will ask I think good questions is this really truly a stem cell er doesn't remember certain aspects of what of changes that were made in the human beyond the genetics it's fast as a skin cell yeah it's fast as a skin cell or its past in terms of exposures to different environmental factors and so on so I think the consensus right now is that these are not always perfect and there is a little bits and pieces of memory sometimes but by and large these are actually pretty good so one of the key things well maybe maybe you can correct me but one of the useful things for machine learning is size scale of data how easy it is to do these kinds of reversals to stem cells and then disease in a dish models at scale is this that a huge challenge or or not so the reverse the reversal is not as of this point something that can be done at the scale of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands I think total number of stem cells or iPS cells that are what's called induced pluripotent stem cells in the world I think is somewhere between five and ten thousand last I looked now again that might not count things that exist in this or that academic center and they may add up to a bit more but that's about the range so it's not something that you could this point generate IPS cells from a million people but maybe you don't need to because maybe that background is enough because it can also be now perturbed in different ways and some people have done really interesting experiments in for instance taking cells from a healthy human and then introducing a mutation into it using some of the using one of the other miracle technologies that's emerged last decade which is CRISPR gene editing and introduced mutation that is known to be pathogenic and so you can now look at the healthy cells and unhealthy cells the one with the mutation and do a one-on-one comparison where everything else is held constant and so you could really start to understand specifically what the mutation does at the cellular level so the IPS cells are a great starting point and obviously more diversity is better because you also want to capture ethnic background and how that affects things but maybe you don't need one from every single patient with every single type of disease because we have other tools at our disposal well how much difference is there between people I mentioned ethnic background in terms of IPS cells so we're all like it seems like these magical cells that can do it to create anything between different populations different people is there a lot of variability between stem cells well first of all there's the variability that's driven simply by the fact that genetically we're different so a stem cell let's drive for my genotype is gonna be different from itself stem cells derive from your genotype there's also some differences that I have more to do with for whatever reason some people stem cells differentiate better than other people stem cells we don't entirely understand why so there's certainly some differences there as well but the fundamental difference and the one that we really care about and is a positive is that the is the fact that the genetics are different and therefore we capitulate my disease burden versus your disease burden what's the disease burden well it disease burden is just if you think I mean it's not a well-defined mathematical term although there are mathematical formulations of it it if you think about the fact that some of us are more likely to get a certain disease than others because we have more variations in our genome that are causative of the disease maybe fewer that are protective of the disease people have quantified that using what are called polygenic risk scores which look at all of the variations in an individual person's genome and add them all up in terms of how much risk they confer for a particular disease and then they've put people on a spectrum of their disease risk and for certain diseases where we've been sufficiently powered to really understand the connection between the many many small variations that give rise to an increased disease risk there is some pretty significant differences in terms of the risk between the people say at the highest decile of this polygenic risk score and the people at the lowest decile sometimes those other differences are you know factor of 10 or 12 higher so there's definitely a lot that our genetics contributes to disease risk even if it's not by any stretch the full explanation and from the machine learning perspective their signal there there is definitely signal in the genetics and there is even more signal we believe in looking at the cells that are derived from those different genetics because in principle you could say all the signal is there the at the genetics level so we don't need to look at the cells but our understanding of the biology so limited at this point then seeing what actually happens at the cellular level is a heck of a lot closer to the human clinical outcome than looking at the genetics directly and so we can learn a lot more from it than we could by looking at genetics alone so just to get a sense that enough it's easy to do but what kind of data is useful in this disease in a dish model like what what are what's what's the source of raw data information and also for my outsider's perspective sort of biology and cells are squishy things and I think they are how do you connect literally you connect the computer to to that which sensory mechanisms I guess so that's another one of those revolutions that have happened the last ten years and that our ability to measure cells very quantitatively has also dramatically increased so back when I started doing biology and you know late 90s early 2000s that was the initial era where we started to measure biology in really quantitative ways using things like microarrays where you would measure in a single experiment the activity level what's called expression level of multiple of every gene in the genome in that sample and that ability is what actually allowed us to even understand that there are molecular subtypes of diseases like cancer where up until that point is like oh you have breast cancer but then we looked we looked at the molecular data it was clear that there's different subtypes of breast cancer that at the level of gene activity look completely different to each other so that was the beginning of this process now we have the ability to measure individual cells in terms of their gene activity using what's called single cell RNA sequencing which basically sequences the RNA which is that activity level of different genes for every gene in the genome and you could do that at single cell level so that's an incredibly powerful way of measuring cells I mean you literally count the number of transcripts oh really turns that squishy thing in something that's digital another tremendous this data source that's emerged the last few years is microscopy and and specifically even super resolution microscopy where you could use digital reconstruction to look at sub cellular structures sometimes even things that are below the diffraction limit of light by doing a sophisticated reconstruction and again that gives you tremendous amount of information at the sub cellular level there's now more and more ways that an amazing scientists out there are developing for getting new types of information from even single cells and so that is a way of turning those squishy things into digital data into beautiful datasets but so that data said then with machine learning tools allows you to maybe understand the developmental like the mechanism of the a particular disease and if it's possible to sort of at a high level describe how does how does that help lead to drug discovery that can help prevent reverse that mechanism so I think there's different ways in which this data could potentially be used some people use it for scientific discovery and say oh look we see this phenotype at the cellular level so let's try and work our way backwards and think which genes might be involved in pathways that give rise that so that's a very sort of analytical method to sort of work our way backwards using our understanding of known biology some people use it in a somewhat more you know sort of forward that would if that was a backward this would be forward which is to say okay if I can perturb this gene doesn't show a phenotype that is similar to what I see in disease patients and so maybe that gene is actually causal of the disease so that's a different way and then there's what we do which is basically to take that very large collection of the and use machine learning to uncover the patterns that emerge from it so for instance what are those subtypes that might be similar at the human clinical outcome but quite distinct when you look at the molecular data and then if we can identify such a subtype are there interventions that if I apply it to cells that come from this subtype of the disease and you apply that intervention it could be a drug or it could be a CRISPR gene intervention it does it revert the disease state to something that looks more like normal happy healthy cells and so hopefully if you see that that gives you a certain hope that that intervention will also have a meaningful clinical benefit to people and there's obviously a bunch of things that you would want to do after that to validate that but it's a very different and much less hypothesis-driven way of uncovering new potential interventions and might give rise to things that are not the same things that everyone else is already looking at that's uh I don't know I'm just like to psychoanalyze my own feeling about our discussion currently it's so exciting to talk about so if I'm Ashiya fundamentally well something that's been turned into a machine learning problem and that says can have so much real-world impact that's kind of exciting because I'm so most of my days spent with datasets that I guess closer to the news groups okay so this is a kind of it just feels good to talk about in fact I don't almost don't want to talk about machine learning I want to talk about the fundamentals of the data set which is which is an exciting place to be I agree with you it's what gets me up in the morning it's also what attracts a lot of the people who work at in seat row two in seat row because I think all of the certainly all of our machine learning people are outstanding and could go get a job you know selling ads online or doing commerce or even self-driving cars yes but but I think they would want they they come to us because what because they want to work on something that more of an aspirational nature and can really benefit humanity what with these with these approaches what do you hope what kind of diseases can be helped we mentioned Alzheimer said schizophrenia type 2 diabetes can you just describe the various kinds of diseases that this approach can it can help well we don't know and I try and be very cautious about making promises about some things that o we will cure X that people make that promise and I think it's I tried to first deliver and then promise as opposed to the other way around there are characteristics of a disease that make it more likely that this type of approach can potentially be helpful so for instance diseases have a very strong genetic basis are ones that are more likely to manifest and a stem cell derived model we would want the cellular models to be relatively reproducible and robust so that you could actually get a enough of those cells and in a way that isn't very highly variable and noisy you would want the disease to be relatively contained in one or a small number of cell types that you could actually create in an in vitro in a dish setting whereas if it's something that's really broad and systemic and involves multiple cells that are in very distal parts of your body putting that all in the dish is really challenging so we want to focus on the ones that are most likely to be successful today with the hope I think that it's really smart bioengineers out there are developing better and better systems all the time so the diseases that might not be tractable today might be tractable in three years so for instance five years ago these stem cell drive models didn't really exist people were doing most of the work in cancer cells and the cancer cells are very very poor models of most human biology because they're a they were cancer to begin with and B as you passage them and they proliferate in a dish they become because of the genomic instability even less similar to human biology now we have these stem cell derived models we have the capability to reasonably robustly not quite at the right scale yet but close to derive what's called organoids which are these teeny little sort of multicellular organ of an organ system so there's cerebral organoids and liver organoids and kidney organoids and yeah brain organize organize possibly the coolest thing I've ever seen and then I think we're starting to see things like connecting these organize to each other so that you could actually start and there's some really cool papers that start to do that where you can actually start to say okay can we do multi organ system stuff there's many challenges that it's not easy by any stretch but it might I'm sure people will figure it out and in three years or five years there will be disease moles that we could make for things that we can't make today yeah and this conversation would seem almost outdated with a kind of scale that could be achieved in like three years that would be so cool the you've co-founded Coursera with injurying and were part of the whole MOOC revolution so to jump topics a little bit can you maybe tell the origin story of the history the origin story of MOOCs of Coursera and in general the your teaching to huge audiences on a very sort of impactful topic of AI general so I think the origin story of MOOCs emanates from a number of efforts that occurred at Stanford University around you know the late 2000s where different individuals within Stanford myself included were getting really excited about the opportunities of using online technologies as a way of achieving both improved quality of teaching and also improved scale and so Andrew for instance led the the for engineering everywhere which was sort of an attempt to take ten Stanford courses and put them online just as you know video lectures I led an effort within Stanford to take some of the courses and really create a very different teaching model that broke those up into smaller units and had some of those embedded interactions and and so on which got a lot of support from University leaders because they felt like it was potentially a way of improving the quality of instruction in Stanford by moving to what's now called the flipped classroom model and so those efforts eventually sort of started to interplay with each other and created a tremendous sense of excitement and energy within the Stanford community about the potential of online teaching and led in the fall of 2011 to the launch of the first inferred MOOCs by the way MOOCs it's probably impossible that people don't know but I guess massive open online courses but online courses so they're not come up with the acronym I'm not particularly fond of the acronym but it is what it is where this Big Bang is not a great term for the start of the universe but it is what it is probably so anyway we so those courses launched in in the fall of 2011 and there were within a matter of weeks with no real publicity campaign just a New York Times article that went viral about a hundred thousand students or more in each of those courses and I remember this conversation that Andrew and I had was like wow just there's this real need here and I think we both felt like sure we were accomplished academics and we could go back and you know go back to our lives write more papers but if we did that then this wouldn't happen and it seemed too important not to happen and so we spent a fair bit of time debating do we want to do this as a Stanford efforts kind of building on what we'd started do we want to do this as a for-profit company doing this is a non-profit and we decided ultimately to do it as we did with Coursera and so you know we started really operating as a company at the beginning of 2012 but how did you was that really surprising to you how how do you at that how did you at that time and at this time make sense of this need for sort of global education you mentioned that you felt that while the the popularity indicates that there's a hunger for sort of globalization of learning I think there is a hunger for learning that you know globalization is part of it but I think it's just a hunger for learning the world has changed in the last 50 years it used to be that you finished college you got a job by and large the skills that you learned in college were pretty much what got you through the rest of your job history and and yeah you learned some stuff but it wasn't a dramatic change today we're in a world where the skills that you need for a lot of jobs they didn't even exist when you went to college and the jobs and many of the jobs that exist when you went the college don't even exist today or dying so part of that is due to AI but not only and we need to find a way of keeping people giving people access to the skills that they need today and I think that's really what's driving a lot of this hunger so I think if we even take a step back all for you all the start in trying to think of new ways to teach or to you know new ways to sort of organize the material and present the material in a way that would help the education process the better gotcha yeah so what have you learned about effective education from this process of playing of experimenting with different ideas so we learned a number of things some of which I think could translate back and have translated back effectively to how people teach on campus and some of which I think are more specific to people who learn online and more sort of people who learn as part of their daily life so we learned for instance very quickly that short is better so people who are especially in the workforce can't do a 15-week semester long course they just can't fit that into their lives shortly can you uh can you describe the shortness of what the the the entirety so every aspects of the little lecture short this the less your short the course is short both we started out you know the first online education efforts were actually mi t--'s OpenCourseWare initiatives and that was you know recording of classroom lectures and you know hour and a half or something like that yeah that didn't really work very well I mean some people benefit I mean of course they did but it's not really very palatable experience for someone who has a job and you know three kids and that they need to run errands and such they can't fit 15 weeks into their life and and the hour and a half is really hard so we learned very quickly and we started out with short video modules and over time we made them shorter because we realized that 15 minutes was still too long if you want to fit in when you're waiting in line for your kids doctor's appointment it's better if it's 5 to 7 we learned that 15 week courses don't work and you really want to break this up into shorter units so that there is a natural completion point gives people a sense of they're really close to finishing something meaningful they can always come back and take part two and part three we also learned that compressing the content works really well because if some people that pace works well for others they can always rewind and watch again and so people have the ability to then learn at their own pace and so that flexibility the the brevity and the flexibility are both things that we found to be very important we learned that engagement during the content is important and the quicker you give people feedback the more likely they are to be engaged hence the introduction of these which we actually was an intuition that I had going in and and was then validated using data that introducing some of these sort of little quick micro quizzes into the lectures really helps self graded as automatically graded assessments really help too because it gives people feedback see there you are so all these are valuable and then we learn about two other things - oh we did some really interesting experiments for instance on though gender bias and how having a female role model as an instructor can change the balance of men to women in terms of especially in stem courses and you could do that online by doing a/b testing in ways that would be really difficult to go on campus oh that's exciting but so the shortness the compression I mean that's actually so that that probably is true for all you know good editing is always just compressing the content making it shorter so that puts a lot of burden on the creator of the the instructor and the creator of the educational content probably most lectures at MIT or Stanford could be five times shorter if the preparation was put was put enough so maybe people might disagree with that but like the Christmas the clarity that a lot of them like Coursera delivers is how much effort does that take so first of all let me say that it's not clear that that crispness would work as effectively and a face-to-face setting because people need time to absorb the material and so you need to at least pause and give people a chance to reflect that maybe practice and that's what MOOCs do is that they give you these chunks of content and then ask you to practice with it and that's where I think some of the newer pedagogy that people are adopting and face-to-face teaching they have to do with interactive learning and such it can be really helpful but both those approaches whether you're doing that type of methodology and online teaching or in that flipped classroom interactive teaching what site applause what's flipped classroom flipped classroom is a way in which online content is used a supplement face-to-face teaching where people watch the videos perhaps and do some of the exercises before coming to class and then when they come to classes actually to do much deeper problem solving oftentimes in a group but any one of those different pedagogy's that are beyond just standing there and droning on in front of the classroom for an hour and 15 minutes require a heck of a lot more preparation and so it's one of the challenges I think that people have that we had when trying to convince instructors to teach on Coursera and it's part of the challenges that pedagogy experts on campus have in trying to get faculty to teach differently is that it's actually harder to teach that way than it is to stand there drone do you think MOOCs will replace in-person education or become the majority of in-person of Education of the way people learn in the future again the future could be very far away but where's the trend going do you think so I think it's a nuanced and complicated answer I don't think MOOCs will replace face-to-face teaching I think learning is in many cases a social experience and even at Coursera we had people who naturally formed study groups even when they didn't have to just come and talk to each other and we found that that actually benefited their learning in very important ways so there was more success in among learners who had those study groups than among ones who didn't so I don't think it's just gonna oh we're all gonna just suddenly learn online with a computer and no one else in the same way that you know recorded music has not replaced live concerts but I do think that especially when you are thinking about continuing education the stuff that people get when they're traditional whatever high school college education is done and they yet have to maintain their level of expertise and skills in a rapidly changing world I think people will sooo more and more educational content in this online format because going back to school for formal education is not an option for most people briefly I know it might be a difficult question to ask but there's a lot of people fascinated by artificial intelligence by machine learning but deep learning is there a recommendation for the next year or for a lifelong journey as somebody interested in this how do they how do they begin how do they enter that learning journey I think the important thing is first to just get started and there's plenty of online content that one can get for both the core foundations of mathematics and statistics and programming and then from there to machine learning I would encourage people not to skip too quickly past the foundations because I find that there is a lot of people who learn machine learning whether it's online or on campus without getting those foundations and they basically just turn the crank on existing models in ways that they don't allow for a lot of innovation and an adjustment to the problem at hand but also be or sometimes just wrong and they don't even realize that their application is wrong because there's artifacts that they haven't fully understood so I think the foundations machine learning is an important step and then and then actually start solving problems try and find someone to solve them with because especially at the beginning is useful to have someone to bounce ideas off and fix mistakes that you make and and you can fix mistakes that they make but but then just find practical problems whether it's in your workplace or if you don't have that catechol competitions or such are a really great place to find interesting problems and just practice practice perhaps a bit of a romanticized question but what idea in deep learning do you find have you found in your journey the most beautiful or surprising or interesting perhaps not just deep learning but AI in general statistics good answer with two things one would be the foundational concept of end to end training which is that you start from the raw data and you train something that is not like a single piece but rather the towards the actual goal that you're looking to from the raw data to the outcome like and nothing no no details in between well not no details but the fact that you I mean you could certainly introduce building blocks that were trained towards other tasks and actually coming to that in my second half of the answer but it doesn't have to be like a single monolithic blob in the middle actually I think that's not ideal but rather the fact that at the end of the day you can actually train something and goes all the way from the beginning to the end and the other one that I find really compelling is the notion of learning a representation that in its turn even if it was trained to another task can potentially be used as a much more rapid starting point to solving a different task and that's I think reminiscent of what makes people successful learners it's something that is relatively new in the machine learning space I think it's underutilized even relative to today's capabilities but more and more of how do we learn sort of reusable representation so end to end and transfer learning yeah is it surprising to you that neural networks are able to in many cases do these things it says it may be taking back to when you when you first would dive deep into neural networks or in general even today is it surprising that neural networks work at all and work wonderfully to do this kind of raw and then learning and even transfer learning I think I was surprised by how well when you have large enough amounts of data it's possible to find a meaningful representation in what is an exceedingly high dimensional space and so I find that to be really exciting and people are still working out the math for that there's more papers on that every year and I think it's would be really cool if we figured that out but that to me was a surprise because in the early days when I was starting my weigh in machine learning and the data sets were rather small I think we we believed I believe that you needed to have a much more constrained and knowledge rich search space to really make to really get to a meaningful answer and I think it was true at the time what I think is is still a question is will a completely knowledge free approach where there's no prior knowledge going into the construction of the model is that going to be the solution or not it's not actually the solution today in the sense that the architecture of a you know convolutional neural network that's used for images is actually quite different to the type of networks it's used for language and yet different from the one that's used for speech or biology or any other application there's still some insight that goes into the structure of the network to get the the right performance will you be able to come up with the universal learning machine I don't know I wonder if there's always has to be some insight injected somewhere or whether it can converge so you've done a lot of interesting work with probabilistic graphical models in general Bayesian deep learning and and so on so can you maybe speak high level how can learning systems deal with uncertainty one of the limitations I think of a lot of machine learning models is that they come up with an answer and you don't know how much you can believe that answer and oftentimes the the the answer is actually quite poorly calibrated relative to its uncertainties even if you look at where the um you know the the the confidence that comes out of the say the neural network at the end and you ask how much more likely is an answer of zero point eight versus zero point nine it's not really in any way calibrated to the to the actual reliability of that network and how true it is and the further away you move from the training data the more not only the more wrong then that workers often is more wrong and more confident in a strong answer and that is a serious issue in a lot of application areas so when you think for instance about medical diagnosis as being maybe an epitome of how problematic this can be if you were training your network on a certain set of patients on a certain patient population and I have a patient that is an outlier and there's no human that looks at this and that patient is put into a neural network in your network not only gives a completely incorrect diagnosis but it's supremely confident and it's wrong answer you could kill people so I think creating more of an understanding of how do you do snut works that are calibrated in our uncertainty and can also say you know I give up I don't know what to say about this particular data instance because I've never seen something that sufficiently liked it before I think it's going to be really important in mission-critical applications especially ones where human life is at stake and that includes the you know medical applications but it also includes you know automated driving because you'd want the network to be able to you know what I have no idea what this blob is that I'm seeing in the middle of the rest I'm just gonna stop because I don't want to potentially run over a pedestrian that I don't recognize is there good mechanisms ideas of how to allow learning systems to provide that uncertainty whatever along with their predictions certainly people have come up with mechanisms that involve Bayesian deep learning deep learning that involves Gaussian processes I mean there is a slew of different approaches that people have come up with there's methods that use ensembles of networks with trained with different subsets of theta or different random starting points those are actually sometimes surprisingly good at creating a sort of set of how confident or not you are in your answer it's very much an area of open research let's cautiously French your back into the land of philosophy and speaking of AI systems providing uncertainty somebody like Stuart Russell believes that as we create more and more intelligent systems it's really important for them to be full of self-doubt because you know if they're given more and more power we want them the way to maintain human control over a systems or human supervision which is true like you just mentioned with autonomous vehicles it's really important to get human supervision when the car is not sure because if it's really confident it can in cases when it can get in trouble is going to be really problematic so let me ask about sort of the questions of AGI in human level intelligence I mean we talked about curing diseases now which is sort of fundamental thing we could have an impact today but yet people also dream of both understanding and creating intelligence is that something you think about is that something you dream about is that something you think is within our reach to be thinking about as computer scientists boy let me tease apart different parts of that question the first question yeah it's a multi-part question so let me start with the feasibility of AGI then I'll talk about the timelines a little bit and then talk about well what controls does one need when protecting when thinking about protections and the AI space so you know I think AGI obviously is a long-standing dream that even our early pioneers in the space had you know the Turing test and so on are the earliest discussions of that we're obviously closer than we were 70 or so years ago but I think it's still very far away I think machine learning algorithms today are Yui exquisitely good pattern recognizers in very specific problem domains where they have seen enough training data to make good predictions you take a machine learning algorithm and you move a different version of even that same problem far less one that's different and it will just completely choke so I think we're nowhere close to the versatility and flexibility of even a human toddler in terms of their ability to context switch and solve different problems using a single knowledge-based single brain so am i desperately worried about the machines taking over the universe and you know starting to kill people because they want to have more power I don't think so well sort of to pause on that so you kind of intuited that super intelligence is a very difficult thing to achieve that were intelligent intelligent super intelligence we're not even close to intelligence even just the greater abilities of generalization of our current systems but we haven't answered all the parts you don't want to go into the second oh good we take but maybe another tangent you can also pick up as can we get in trouble with much Dumber systems yes that is exactly where I was going okay so I so just to wrap up on the threats of AGI I think that it seems to me a little early today to figure out protections against a human level or superhuman level intelligence who's where we don't even see the skeleton of what that would look like so it seems that it's very speculative on how what how to protect against that but we can definitely and have gotten into trouble on much Dumber systems and a lot of that has to do with the fact that the systems that we're building are increasingly complex increasingly poorly understood and there's ripple effects that are unpredictable in changing little things that's gonna have dramatic consequences on the outcome and by the way that's not unique to artificial now this is I think artificial intelligence exacerbates that brings it to a new level but the heck our electric grid is really complicated the software that runs our financial markets is really complicated and we've seen those ripple effects translate to dramatic negative consequences like for instance financial crashes that have to do with feedback loops that we didn't anticipate so I think that's an issue that we need to be thoughtful about in many places artificial intelligence being one of them and we should and I think it's really important that people are thinking about ways in which we can have better interpret ability of systems better tests for for instance measuring the extent to which a machine learning system that was trained in one set of circumstances how well does it actually work in a very different set of circumstances where you might say for instance well I'm not going to be able to test my automated via call in every possible City Village weather condition and so on but if you trained it on this set of conditions and then tested it on 50 or 100 others that were quite different from the ones that you trained it on then I can it worked then that gives you confidence that the next 50 that you didn't test it on might also work so effectively testing for generalizability so I think there's ways that we should be constantly thinking about to validate the robustness of our systems I think it's very different from the let's make sure robots don't take over the world and then the other place where I think we have a threat which is also important for us to think about is the extent to which technology can be abused so like any really powerful technology machine learning can be very much used badly as well as too good and that goes back to many other technologies that have come up with when people invented projectile missiles and it turns into guns and people invented nuclear power and it turned nuclear bombs and I think honestly I would say that to me gene editing and CRISPR is at least as dangerous at technology if used badly than machine as machine learning you could create really nasty viruses and such using gene editing that are you know you would be really careful about so anyway that's something that we need to be really thoughtful about whenever we have any really powerful new technology yeah and on the case of machine learning is at the stereo machine learning so all the kinds of attacks like security almost threats and there's a social engineering with machine learning algorithm and big brother's watching you and there is the killer drones that can potentially go and targeted execution of people in a different country I don't you know want them are he that are not necessarily that much better but but you know people want to kill someone they'll find a way to do it so if you if in general if you look at trends in the data there's less Wars there's just violence there's more human rights so we've been doing overall quite good as a human species are you are you optimistic maybe another way to ask is do you think most people are good and fundamentally we tend towards a better world which is underlying the question well machine learning what gene editing ultimately land us somewhere good are you optimistic I think by and large I'm optimistic I think that most people mean well that doesn't mean that most people are you know altruistic do-gooders but I think most people mean well but I think it's also really important for us as a society to create social norms we're doing good and being perceived well by our peers is are positively correlated I mean it's very easy to create dysfunctional societies there's certainly multiple psychological experiments as well as sadly real-world events where people have devolved to a world where being perceived well by your peers is correlated with really atrocious often genocide 'el behaviors so we really want to make sure that we maintain a set of social norms where people know that to be a successful member of society you want to be doing good and one of the things that I sometimes worry about is that some societies don't seem to necessarily be moving in the forward direction in that regard where it's not necessarily the case that doing that being a good person is what makes you be perceived well by your peers and I think that's a really important thing for us as a society to remember it's very easy to degenerate back into a universe where it's okay to do really bad stuff and still have your peers think you're amazing it's fun to ask a world-class computer scientist and engineer a ridiculously philosophical question like what is the meaning of life let me ask what gives your life meaning what are what is the source of fulfilment happiness joy purpose when we were starting Coursera in the fall of 2011 that was right around the time that Steve Jobs passed away and so the media was full various famous quotes Heath uh turd and one of them that really stuck with me because it resonated with stuff that I'd been feeling for even years before that is that our goal in life should be to make a dent in the universe so I think that to me what gives my life meaning is that I would hope that when I am lying there on my deathbed and looking at what I'd done in my life that I can point to ways in which I have left the world a better place than it was when I entered it this is something I tell my kids all the time because I also think that the burden of that is much greater for those of us who were born to privilege and in some ways I was I mean it wasn't more than wealthy or anything like that but I grew up in an educated family with parents who loved me and took care of me and I had a chance at a great education and and so I and I've always had enough to eat so I was in many ways born to privilege more than the vast majority of humanity and my kids I think are even more so born to privilege then I was fortunate enough to be and I think it's really important that for especially for those of us who have that opportunity that we use our lives to make the world a better place I don't think there's a better way to end it that needs a
