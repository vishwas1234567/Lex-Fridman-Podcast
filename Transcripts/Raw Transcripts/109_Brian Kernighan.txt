 the following is a conversation with Brian Kernighan a professor of computer science at Princeton University he was a key figure in the computer science community in the early UNIX days alongside UNIX creators Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie he co-authored the C programming language with Dennis Ritchie the creator of C and has written a lot of books on programming computers and life including the practice of programming the goal programming language and his latest UNIX a history and a memoir he co-created awk the text processing language used by Linux folks like myself he Co designed ample an algebraic modeling language that I personally love and have used a lot in my life for large scale optimization I think I can keep going for a long time with his creations and accomplishments which is funny because given all that he's one of the most humble and kind people I've spoken to on this podcast quick summary of the ads - new sponsors the amazing self cooling 8 sleep mattress and rake on

anecdotally he's been a game changer for me I love it the patro is packed with sensors that track heart rate heart rate variability and respiratory rate showing it all on their app once you wake up plus if you have a partner you can control the temperature of each side of the bed I don't happen to have one but the a sleep app reminds me that I should probably get on that so ladies if a temperature controlled mattress isn't a good reason to apply I don't know what is the apps health metrics are amazing but the cooling alone is honestly worth the money as some of you know I don't

years ago in me more than fifty years ago can you tell the story like you're describing your new book of how UNIX was created ha if I couldn't remember that far back well it was some while ago um so I think the gist of it is that at Bell Labs and in 1969 there were a group of people who had just finished working on the multics project which was itself falling on to CTS s so we can go back sort of an infinite regress in time but the CTS s was a very very very nice time sharing system was very nice to use I actually used it as that summer I spent in Cambridge in 1966 for was the hardware there right so what's the operating system what's the hardware there what's the CTS look like so cts s looked like kind of like a standard time sharing system certainly at the time it was the only time sharing if no let's go back to the basic ok in the beginning was the word and the word sign there was time sharing systems yeah if we go back into let's call it the 1950s and early 1960s most computing was done on very big computers physically big although not terribly powerful by today's standards that were maintained in very large rooms and you used things like punch cards to write programs on talk to him so you would take a deck of cards write your program on it send it over a counter hand it to an operator and some while later back would come something that said oh you made a mistake and then you'd recycle and so it's very very slow so the idea of time sharing was that you take basically that same computer but connect to it with something that looked like an electric typewriter they could be a long distance away it could be closed but fundamentally what the operating system did was to give each person who was connected to it and wanting to do something a small slice of time on to do a particular job so I might be editing a file so I would be typing and every time I hit a keystroke the operating system would wake up and said oh he typed character let me remember that and then it go back to doing something else would be going around and around a group of who were trying to get something done giving each a small slice of time and giving them each the illusion that they pretty much hit the whole machine to themselves and hence time sharing that is sharing the computing time resource of the computer among a number of people who are doing it without the individual people being aware that there's others in a sense the illusion the feeling is that you the machine is your own pretty much that was the idea yes you had if it were well done and if it were fast enough and other people were doing too much you did have the illusion that you had the whole machine to yourself and it was very much better than the punch card model and so cts s the compatible time sharing system was I think arguably the first of these it was done I guess technically 64 or something like that it ran on an IBM 7090 for slightly modified to have twice as much memory as the norm it had two banks of 32 k words instead of one so 32 K words yes where's this 36 bit so call it you know about a hundred and fifty kilobytes times two so by today's standards that's down in the noise yeah at the time that was a lot of memory and memory was expensive so C TSS was just a wonderful environment to work on it was done by the people that MIT led by Fernando Corbett Oh of Cour be who died just earlier this year and a bunch of other folks and then so I spent the summer of 66 working on that had a great time met a lot of really nice people and indirectly knew of people at Bell Labs who were also working on a follow-on to C TSS that was called multics so multics was meant to be the system that would do everything that C TSS did but do it better for a larger population that's all the usual stuff now the actual time sharing the scheduling how much what's the algorithm that performs the scheduling what's that look like how much magic is there what are the metrics how does it all work in the beginning so the answers I don't have a clue I think the basic idea was nothing more than who all wants to get something done suppose things are very in the middle of the night then I get all the time that I want suppose that you and I are contending at high noon for something like that then probably the simplest algorithm is a round robin one that gives you a bit of time gives me a bit of time and then we could adapt to that like what are you trying to do are you text editing or are you compiling or something and we might adjust the scheduler according to things like that so okay so multics was trying to just do some of the clean it up a little bit well it was it was meant to be much more than that so multix was the multiplexed information and computing service and it was meant to be a very large thing we would provide computing utility something that where you could actually think of it as just a plug in the wall service sort of like cloud computing today yeah same idea but 50 odd years earlier and so what multix offered was a richer operating system environment piece of hardware that was better designed for doing the kind of sharing of resources and presumably lots of other things do you think people at that time had the dream of what cloud computing is starting to become now which is computing is everywhere that you can just plug in almost no you know and you never know how the magic works you just kind of plug in add in your little computation they need to perform and it does it it was that the dream I don't know where that was the dream I wasn't part of it at that point remember I was an intern first summer but my sense is given that it was over 50 years ago yeah they had that idea that it was an information utility that it was something where if you had a computing task to do you could just go and do it now I'm betting that they didn't have the same view of computing for the masses let's call it the idea that you know your grandmother would be shopping on Amazon I don't think that was part of it but if your grandmother were a programmer it might be very easy for her to go and use this kind of utility what was your dream of computers at that time what did you see as the future of computers could you have predicted what computers are today that you sense Oh short answer absolutely not I have no clue I'm not sure I had a dream it was a dream job in the sense that I really enjoyed what I was doing I was surrounded by really really nice people Cambridge is a very fine city to live in in the summer less so in the winter when it snows but in the summer it was a delightful time and so I really enjoyed all of that stuff and I learned things and I think the good fortune of being there for summer led me then to get a summer job at Bell Labs the following summer and that was going to useful for the future so this Bell Labs is this magical legendary place so first of all where is Bell Labs and can you start talking about that journey towards Unix at Bell Labs yeah so Bell Labs is physically scattered around at the time scattered around New Jersey the primary location was in a town called Murray Hill where a location called Murray Hill is actually then across the boundary between two small towns in New Jersey called New Providence and Berkeley Heights think of it as about 15-20 miles straight west of New York City and therefore but an hour north of here and for instance and at that time it had make up a number three or four thousand people there many of whom had PhDs and mostly doing physical sciences chemistry physics materials kinds of things but very strong math and it rapidly growing interest in computing as people realized you could do things with computers that you might not have been able to do before you could replace labs with computers that had worked on models of what was going on so that was the essence of Bell Labs and again I wasn't the permanent play there I was that was another internship I got lucky in internships I mean if you could just linger in a little bit what was the what was in the air there because some of this is the number of Nobel Prizes the number of touring Awards and just legendary computer scientists that come from their inventions including developments including UNIX it's just is unbelievable so is it was there something special about that place oh I think there was very definitely something special I mentioned the number of people's a very large number of people very highly skilled working in an environment where there was always something interesting to work on because the goal of Bell Labs which was a small part of a TMT which provided basically the country's phone service the goal of a TMT was to provide service for everybody and the goal of Bell Labs was to try and make that service keep getting better so improving service and that meant doing research on a lot of different things physical devices like the transistor or fiber optical cables or microwave systems all of these things the labs worked on and it was kind of just the beginning of real boom times in computing as well is when I was there I went there first in 66 so computing was at that point fairly young and so people were discovering that you could do lots of things with computers so how's Unix born so multix in spite of having an enormous number of really good ideas lots of good people working on it fundamentally didn't live up at least in the short run and I think ultimately really ever to its goal of being this information utility it was too expensive and certainly what was promised was delivered much too late and so in roughly the beginning of 1969 Bell Labs pulled out of the project the project at that point had included MIT Bell Labs and General Electric General Electric made computers so General Electric was the hardware operation so Bell Labs realizing this wasn't going anywhere on a time scale they cared about pulled out his project and this left several people with an acquired taste for really really nice computing environments but no computing environment and so they started thinking about what could you do if you're going to design a new operating system that would provide the same kind of comfortable computing as cts s head but also the facilities of something like multics sort of brought forward and so they did a lot of paper design stuff and at the same time Ken Thompson found what is characterized as a little-used pdp-7 where he started to do experiments with file systems just how do you store information on a computer in an efficient way and then this famous story that his wife went away to California for three weeks taking their one-year-old son and three weeks and he sat down and wrote an operating system which ultimately became Unix so software productivity was good in those days the PDP what's the PDP seven so it's a piece of hardware yeah it's a piece of part where it was one of our leading machines made by Digital Equipment Corporation Dec and it was a mini computer so called it had yeah I would have to look up the numbers exactly but it had a very small amount of memory maybe 16 K 16-bit words or something like that relatively slow probably not super expensive maybe again making this up I'd have to look it up a hundred thousand dollars or something like that which is not super expensive in the sious right it was expensive it was enough that you and I probably wouldn't be my white one but a modest group of people could get together but in any case in it came out if I recall in 1964 so by 1969 it was getting a little obsolete and that's why it was little used if you can sort of comment what do you think it's like to write an operating system like that so that process that Ken went through in three weeks because you were I mean you're part of that process you've contributed a lot to UNIX his early development so what do you think it takes to do that first step that first kind of from designed to a reality on the PDP well let me correct one thing I had nothing to do with it so I did not write it I have never written operating system code and so I don't know now an operating system is simply code and this first one wasn't very big but it's something that lets you run processes of some that you execute some kind of code that has been written it lets you store information for periods of time so that it doesn't go away when you turn the power off or reboot or something like that and there's a kind of a core set of tools that are technically not part of an operating system but you probably need them in this case Ken wrote an assembler for pdp-7 that worked he needed a text editor so that he could actually create text he had the file system stuff that he had been working on and then the rest of it was just a way to load things executable code from the file system into the memory give it control and then recover control when it was finished or in some other way quit what was the code written in the primarily the programming language was it in assembly pdp-7 assembler that Ken created these things were assembly language until probably the call at 1973 or 74 something like that yeah forgive me if it's a dumb question but it feels like a daunting task to write any kind of complex system in assembly absolutely it feels like impossible to do any kind of what we think of a software engineering assembly is to work on a big picture I think it's hard it's been a long time since I wrote assembly language it is absolutely true that in some other language if you make a mistake nobody tells you there are no training wheels whatsoever and so stuff doesn't work now what and there's no the buggers well there could be debuggers but that's the same problem right how do you actually get something that will help you debug it so part of it is is an ability to see the big picture now these systems were not big in the sense of today's picture so the big picture was in some sense more manageable I mean then realistically there's an enormous variation in the capabilities of programmers and Ken Thompson who did that first one is kind of the singularity in my experience of programmers with no disrespect to you or even to me he's gonna die several leagues removed I know there's levels this is it's a it's a fascinating thing that there are unique stars in particular in the programming space and in a particular time you know the time matters to the timing of when that person comes along and the a wife does have to leave see like there's this weird timing that happens that and then all sudden something beautiful is created I mean how does it make you feel that there's a system I was created in in three weeks or maybe you can even say on a whim but not really but of course quickly that is now you could think of most of the computers in the world run on a unix-like system right well how do you ensure like if you kind of zoom from the alien perspective if you're just observing earth that all sudden these computers took over the world and they started from this little initial seed of Unix how does that make you feel it's quite surprising and and and you asked earlier but predictions the answer is no there's no way you could predict that kind of evolution and I don't know whether it was inevitable or just a whole sequence of blind luck I suspect more the latter and so I look at it and think gee that's kind of neat I think the real question is what this can think about that because he's the guy arguably from whom it really came tremendous contributions from Dennis Ritchie and then others around in that Bell Labs environment but you know if you had to pick a single person that would be can see if written in you book UNIX a history and a memoir are there some memorable human stories funny or profound from that time they just kind of stand out oh there's a lot of them in a sense and again it's a question if can you resurrect them this memory fails but I think part of it was that Bell Labs at the time was was a very special kind of place to work because there were a lot of interesting people and the environment was very very open and free it was a very cooperative environment very from the environment and so if you had an interesting problem you go and talk to somebody and they might help you with the solution and and it was a kind of a fun environment to in which people did strange things and often tweaking the bureaucracy in one way or another the rebellious and in some kinds of ways in some ways yeah absolutely I think most people didn't take too kindly to the bureaucracy and I'm sure the bureaucracy put up with an enormous that they didn't really want to so maybe to linger on it a little bit you have a sense of what the philosophy that characterized unix's the design not just the initial but just carry through the years just being there being around what's the fundamental philosophy behind the system I think one aspect the fundamental philosophy was to provide an environment that made it easy to write her easier productive to write program so as men as a programmer environment it wasn't meant specifically as something to do some other kind of job for example it was used extensively for word processing but it wasn't designed as a word processing system it was used extensively for lab control but it wasn't designed for that it was used extensively as a front end for big other systems big dumb systems but it wasn't designed for that it was meant to be an environment where it was really easy to write programs that so the programmers could be highly productive and part of that was to be a community and there's some observation from Dennis Ritchie I think at the end of the book that says that and that from his standpoint the real goal was to create a community where people could work as programmers on a system I think in that sense certainly for many many years it succeeded quite well at that and part of that is the technical aspects of because it made it really easy to write programs people did write interesting programs those programs tended to be used by other programmers and so it was kind of a virtuous circle are of more and more stuff coming out that was really good for programmers and you're part of that community of programmers so what was the like writing programs on that early unix it was a blast it really was you know I like to program I'm not a terribly good programmer but it was a lot of fun to write code and in the early days there was an enormous amount of what you would today I suppose called low-hanging fruit people hadn't done things before and this was this new environment and the the whole combination of nice tools and very responsive system and tremendous colleagues made it possible to write code you could have an idea in the morning you could do it and you know an experiment with it you could have something limping along that night or the next day and people would react to it and they would say oh that's wonderful but you're really screwed up here and and the feedback Luke was then very very short and tight and so a lot of things got developed fairly quickly that in many cases still exists today and I think that was part of what made it fun because programming itself is fun it's puzzle solving in a variety of ways but I think it's even more fun when you do something that somebody else then uses even if they whine about it not working the fact that they used it is as part of the reward mechanism and what was the method of an interaction the communication we need that feedback loop I mean this is before the internet certainly before the internet um it was mostly physical right there you know somebody would come into your office and say something so these places are all closed but like offices are nearby we're really lively into interaction yeah yeah no Bell Labs was fundamentally one giant building and most of the people were involved in this unique stuff we're in two or three quarters and there was a room oh how big was it probably call it 50 feet by 50 feet make up a number of that and which had some access to computers there as well as in offices and people hung out there and had a coffee machine and so that there was a it was mostly very physical we did use email of course and but it was fundamentally all for a long time all on one machine so there was no need for internet it's fascinating to think about what computing would be today without Bell Labs it seems so many the people being in the vicinity of each other it's sort of getting that quick feedback working together there's so many brilliant people I don't know where else that could have existed in the world I've been given how that came together what yeah well how does that make you feel that that's a little element of history well I think that's very nice but in a sense it's survivor bias and if it hadn't happened at Bell Labs there were other places that we're doing really interesting work as well Xerox PARC is perhaps most obvious one Xerox PARC contributed enormous amount of good material and Men anything we take for granted today in the same way came from Xerox PARC experience I don't think they capitalized in the long run as much their parent company was perhaps not as lucky in capitalizing on this who knows but that would that's certainly another place where there was a tremendous amount of influence there were a lot of good university activities MIT was obviously no slouch in this kind of thing and and others as well so Unix turned out to be open source because of the various ways that AT&T operated and sort of they had to it was the focus was on telephones so well I think that's a mischaracterization in the sense it absolutely was not open source it was very definitely proprietary licensed but it was licensed freely to universities in source code form for many years and because of that generations of university students and their faculty people grew up knowing about Unix and there was enough expertise in the community that it then became possible for people to kind of go off in their own direction and build something that looked unix like the berkeley version of unix started with that licensed code and gradually picked up enough of its own code contributions notably from people like Bill joy that eventually it was able to become completely free of any TMT code now there was an enormous amount of legal jockeying around this that in the late early to late 80s Early 90s something like that and then not something that I guess the open source movement might have started when Richard Stallman started to think about this in the late 80s and by 1991 when Torvalds decided he was going to do a unix-like operating system there was enough expertise that in the community that first he had a target he could see what to do because the kind of the UNIX system call interface and the tools and so on were there and so he was able to build an operating system that at this point when you say UNIX in many cases what you're really thinking is Linux Linux yeah but it's it's funny that from my distant perception I felt that UNIX was open-source without actually knowing it but what you're really saying it was just freely licensed so it was freely licensed it felt open-source in a sense because universities are not trying to make money so there it felt open-source in a sense that you can get access if you wanted right and a very very very large number of universities had the license and they were able to talk to all the other universities who had the license and so technically not open technically belonging day T&T pragmatically pretty open and so there's a ripple effect that all the faculty and the students then I'll grew up and then they went throughout the world and permeated in that kind of way so what kind of features do you think made for a good operating system if you take the lessons of Unix you said like you know make it easy for programmers like that seems to be an important one but also UNIX turned out to be exceptionally robust and efficient right so is that an accident when you focus on the programmer or is that a natural outcome I think part of the reason for efficiency was that it began on extremely modest hardware very very very tiny and so you couldn't get carried away you couldn't do a lot of complicated things because you just didn't have the resources either processor speed or memory and so that enforced a certain minimal 'ti of mechanisms and maybe a search for generalizations so that you would find one mechanism that's served for a lot of different things rather than having lots of different special cases I think the file system and UNIX is a good example of that file system interface in its fundamental form is extremely straightforward and that means that you can write code very very effectively from for the file system and then one of those ideas and one of those generalizations is that gee that file system interface works for all kinds of other things as well and so in particular the idea of reading and writing to devices is the same as reading and writing to a disk that has a file system and then that gets carried further in other parts of the world processes become in effect files in a file system and the plan 9 operating system which came along I guess in the late 80s or something like that took a lot of those ideas from the original unix and tried to push the generalization even further so that in plan 9 a lot of different resources our file systems they all share that interface so that would be one example we're finding the right model of how to do something means that an awful lot of things become simpler and it means therefore that more people can do useful interesting things with them without him to think as hard about it so you said you're not a very good programmer you're the most modest human being ok but you'll continue saying that I understand how this works but you do radiate a sort of love for programming so let me ask do you think programming is more an art or science there's a creativity or kind of rigor I think it's some of each it's some combination some of the art is figuring out what it is that did you really want to do what should that program be what would make a good program and that's some understanding of what the task is what the people who might use this program want and I think that's that's art in many respects the science part is trying to figure out how to do it well and some of that is a real computer science II stuff like what algorithm should we use at some point mostly in the sense of being careful to use algorithms that will actually work properly or scale properly avoiding quadratic algorithms when a linear algorithm should be the right thing that got a more formal view of it same thing for data structures but also it's I think an engineering field as well then engineering is not quite the same as science because engineering you're working with constraints you have to figure out not only so what is a good algorithm for the kind of thing but what's the most appropriate algorithm given the amount of time we have to compute the amount of time we have to program what's likely to happen in the future with maintenance who's gonna pick this up in the future all of those kind of things that if you're an engineer you get to worry about whereas if you think of yourself as a scientist well you can maybe push them over their horizon in a way and if you're an artist what's that so just on your own personal level what's your process like of writing a program say a small and large sort of tinkering with stuff you just start coding right away and just kind of evolve iteratively with a loose notion or do you plan and a sheet of paper first and then kind of design and this you know what they teach you in the kind of software engineering courses an undergrad or something like that what's your process like it's certainly much more the informal incremental first I don't write big programs at this point it's been a long time since I wrote a program that weighs more and then I call it a few hundred or more lines something like that many of the programs are right or experiments for either something I'm curious about or often for something that I want to talk about in a class and so those necessarily tend to be relatively small a lot of the kind of code I write these days tends to be for sort of exploratory data analysis where I've got some collection of data and I want to try and figure out what on earth is going on in it and for that those programs tend to be very small sometimes you're not even programming you're just using existing tools like counting things or sometimes you're writing awk scripts because two or three lines will tell you something about a piece of data and then when it gets bigger well and I will probably write something in Python because that scales better up to call it a few hundred lines or something like that and it's been a long time since I wrote programs that were much more than that speaking of data exploration in awk first what is awk so awk is a scripting language that was done by myself el hijo on Peter Weinberger we did that originally in the late 70s it was a language that was meant to make really easy to do quick and dirty tasks like counting things or selecting interesting information from basically all text files rearranging it in some way or summarizing it runs the command on each line of a file I mean there's uh it's still exceptionally widely used today oh absolutely yeah it's so simple an elegant sort of the way to explore data turns out you can just write a script that does something seemingly trivial on a single line and that giving you that slice of the data somehow reveals something fundamental about the data you know that keeps that seems to work still yeah it's very good for that kind of thing that's sort of what it was meant for I think what we didn't appreciate was that the model is actually quite good for a lot of data processing kinds of tasks and that it's it's kept going as long as it has because at this point it's over 40 years old but it's still I think a useful tool and well this is paternal interest I guess but I think in terms of programming languages you get the most bang for the buck by learning awk and it doesn't scale the big programs but it does pretty pretty darn well on these little things where you just want to see all the something's in something so yeah I find I probably write more awk than anything so what what kind of stuff do you love about arc like is there if you can comment on sort of things that give you joy when you can in a simple program reveal something about it is there something that stands out from particular features I think it's mostly the selection of default behaviors that you sort of hinted at at a moment ago what Octus is to read through a set of files and then within each file it rich through a each of the lines and then on each of the lines it has a set of patterns that it looks for that's your arc program and if one of the patterns matches there is a corresponding action that you might perform and so it's kind of a quadruply nested loop or something like that um and that's all completely automatic you don't have to say any think about it you just write the pattern in the action and then run the data by it and and so that paradigm for programming is very natural and effective one and I think we captured that reasonably well and lock and it does other things for free as well it splits the data into fields so that on each line there feels separated by white space or something and so it does that for free you don't have to say anything about it and it collects information it goes along like what line are we on how many fields are there on this line so lots of things that just make it so that a program which in another language let's say Python would be 5 10 20 lines in Arcis one or two lines and so because it's one or two lines you can do it on the shell you don't have to open up another whole thing you can just do it right there and the interaction with Allah perfectly is there other shell commands that you love over the years like you really enjoy using don't major does everything so grep is a kind of what is it a simpler version of awk I would say in some some sense yeah right because what is grep so grep is it basically searches the input for particular patterns regular expressions technically of a certain class and it has that same paradigm that awk does it's a pattern action thing it reads through all the files and then all the lines in each file but it has a single pattern which is the regular expression you're looking for and a single action printed if it matches so it's a in that sense it's a much simpler version and you could write crap in Arcis as a one-liner and I use grep probably more than anything else at this point just because it it's so convenient and natural why do you think it's such a powerful tool grab not why do you think operating systems like Windows for example don't have it sort of you can of course I use which is amazing now there's windows for linux like the which you could basically use all the fun stuff like all can graph and inside of Windows but Windows naturally sort of in the best part of the graphical interface the simplicity sort of searching through a bunch of files and just popping up naturally why don't you think that why do you think that's unique to the UNIX and Linux environment I don't know I it's not strictly unique but it's certainly focused there and I think some of its the weight of history that Windows came from ms-dos ms-dos was a pretty pathetic operating system although common own and you know unbounded lis large number of machines but somewhere in roughly the 90s windows became a graphical system and I think Microsoft spent a lot of their energy on making that graphical interface what it is and that's a different model of computing it's a model of computing that where you point and click and sort of experiment with menus it's a model of computing worked right rather well for people who are not programmers just want to get something done whereas teaching something like the command line to non-programmers turns out just sometimes be an uphill struggle and so I think Microsoft probably was right and what they did now you mentioned whistle or whatever it's called that winix I wonder what spinasse wsl is but I've never actually pronounced the whistle I like it I got no idea but there have been things like that for longest cygwin for example which is a wonderful collection of take all your favorite tools from UNIX and Linux and just make them work perfectly on Windows and so that's a something that's been going on for at least 20 years if not longer and I use that on my one remaining Windows machine aw routinely because it it's for if you're doing something that is batch computing command sudo for command-line that's the right way to do it because the windows equivalents are if nothing else not familiar to me but I should I would definitely recommend to people to if they don't use cygwin to try whistle yes I say I've been so excited that I could use best ivy bash write scripts quickly in in Windows it's changed my life okay what's your perfect programming setup what computer what operating system want keyboard what editor yeah perfect is too strong a word is way to struggle read of what by default I have a at this point a 13-inch MacBook Air which I used because it's kind of a reasonable balance of the various things I need I can carry it around it's got enough computing horsepower screens big enough to keyboards okay and so I basically do most of my computing on that um I have a big iMac in my office that I use from time to time as well especially when I need a big screen but otherwise none tends not to be used as much editor I use mostly Sam which is an editor that Rob Pike wrote long ago at Bell Labs his did that sorry to interrupt it does that precede VI posts it post dates both VI and Emacs it is derived from Rob's experience with Edie and VI on D that's the original UNIX editor o dated probably before you were born so what's actually what's the history of editors can you can you briefly this is your fan I used Emacs I'm sorry to say so I'm sorry to come out with that but what's what's the kind of interplay there yeah so in ancient ancient times like call it the first time sharing systems going back to what we're talking about there were editors there was an editor on C TSS that I don't even remember what it was called al it might have been edit where you could type text program text and it would do something or other document text if it's saved then I'd save it you could edit it you know the usual thing that you would get in an editor and Ken Thompson wrote an editor called QED which was very very powerful but these were all totally a command based they were not most or cursor based because it was before mice and even before cursors because they were running on terminals that printed on paper okay no no CRT type displays let alone LEDs and so then when UNIX came along Ken took QED and stripped way way way way down and that became an editor that he called needy it was very simple but it was a line oriented editor and so you you could load a file and then you could talk about the lines one through the last line and you could you know print ranges of lines you could add text you could delete text you could change text or you could do a substitute command that would change things within a line or within groups of lines they can work on a parts of a file essentially yeah you could work on any part of it the whole thing whatever but it was entirely command line based and it was entirely on paper okay paper and that meant that you've changed yeah right real paper and so if you changed the line you had to print that line using up another line of paper to see what changed cause okay yeah so when thing when CRT displays came along yeah then you could start to use cursor control and you could sort of move where you where on the screen in without reprinting printing and one of there were a number of editors there the one that I was most familiar with and still use is VI which was done by bill joy and so that dates from probably the late 70s as a guess and it took at full advantage of the cursor controls I suspected Emacs was roughly at the same time but I don't know I've never internalized Emacs so so I use at this point I stopped using IDI always can I use VI sometimes and I use Sam when I can and Sam is available on most systems it was it is available you have to download it yourself from typically the plan line operating system distribution it's been maintained by people there and so I'll get home tonight I'll try it that's cool it's a it's a sound sounds fasting all though my love is with Lisp and Emacs have went into that hippie world of I think it's likes what religion where you brought up with yes sir that's right most of the actual programming I do is C C++ and Python but my weird sort of yeah my religious upbringing is unless so can you take on the impossible task and give a brief history of programming languages from your perspective so I guess you could say programming languages started probably in what the late 40s or something like that people used to program computers by basically putting in zeros and ones using something like switches on a console and then or maybe holes and paper tapes something like that so extremely tedious awful whatever and so I think the first programming languages were relatively crude assembly languages where people would basically write a program that would convert mnemonics like add a DD into whatever the bit pattern was it corresponding to an add instruction and they'd do the clerical work of figuring out where things were so you could put a name on a location in a program and the assembler would figure out where that corresponded to when the thing was all put together and dropped into memory and they were early on and this would be the late 40s and very early 50s there were assemblers written for the various machines that people used you may have seen in the paper just a couple days ago Tony Burkert died he did this thing in Manchester called the called auto code a language for China knew only by name but it sounds like it was a flavor of assembly language sort of a little higher in some ways um and a replaced on language that Alan Turing wrote which you put in zeros and ones but you put in an in backwards order because that was a Hardware worked very tense right yeah yeah that's right backwards so assembly languages learn let's call at the early 1950s and so every different flavor of computer has its own assembly language so the EDSAC head hits in a manchester head it and the IBM whatever 70 90 or 704 or whatever had hits and so on so everybody had their own assembly like when assembly languages have a few commands addition subtraction then branching of some kind if then that the situation right they have exactly in their simplest form at least one instruction per or one assembly language instruction per instruction in the machine's repertoire and so you have to know the Machine intimately to be able to write programs in it and if you write an assembly language program for one kind of machine and then you say jeez it's nice I'd like a different machine start over okay so very bad and so what happened in the late 50s was people realize you could play this game again and you could move up a level in writing or creating languages that were closer to the way the real people might think about how to write code and we're I guess arguably three or four at that time period there was Fortran which came from IBM which was formula translation and to make it easy to do scientific and engineering computation is not that formula translation that's what I stood for yeah I where's COBOL which is the common business oriented language that Grace Hopper and others worked on which was named business kinds of tasks there was a well which was mostly meant to describe algorithmic computations I guess you could argue basic was in there somewhere I think it's just a little later and so all of those moved the level up and so they were closer to what you and I might think of as we were trying to write a program and they were focused on different domains Fortran for formula translation engineering computations let's say COBOL for business that kind of thing still used today Fortran probably oh yeah COBOL too but the deal was that once you moved up that level then you let's call it Fortran you had a language that was not tied to a particular kind of hardware because a different compiler would compile for different kind of hardware and that meant two things it meant you only had to write the program once which is very important and it meant that you could in fact if you were a random engineer physicist whatever you could write that program yourself you didn't have to hire a programmer to do it for you might not be as good as you'd get through a programmer but it was pretty good and so it democratized and made much more broadly available the ability to write code so it puts the power of programming to the hands of people like you yeah anybody who wants to who under to invest some time in learning a programming language and is not then tied to a particular kind of computer and then in the 70s you get system programming languages of which C is the survivor and what what a system programming language learning programs that programming languages that would take on the kinds of things that would necessary to write so-called system programs things like text editors or assemblers or compilers or operating systems themselves those kinds of things and fortunately feature-rich they have to be able to do a lot of stuff a lot of memory management access processes and all that kind of stuff they a little processing it's a different flavor what they're doing they're much more in touch with the actual machine in a but in a positive way that is you can talk about memory in a more controlled way you can talk about the different data types that the Machine supports and underway there and more ways to structure and organize data and so the system programming languages there was a lot of effort in that and call it the late 60s early 70s C is I think the only real survivor of that and then what happens after that you get things like object-oriented programming languages because as you write programs in a language like C at some point scale gets to you and it's too hard to keep track of the pieces and there's no guardrails or training wheels or something like that to prevent you from doing bad things so C++ comes out of that tradition it's and then it took off from there I mean there's also a parallel slightly parallel track with a little bit of functional stuff with Lisp and so on but I guess from that point is just an explosion of languages it was a Java story there's the JavaScript there's all the stuff that the cool kids these days are doing with rust and all that they don't so what's to use you're you wrote a book C programming language what and C is probably one of the most important languages in the history of programming languages if you kind of look at impact what do you think is the most elegant or powerful part of see why did it survive what did it have such a long-lasting impact I think it found a sweet spot that in of expressiveness so you can rewrite things in a pretty natural way and efficiency which was particularly important when computers were not nearly as powerful as they are today again put yourself back 50 years almost in terms of what computers could do that's you know roughly four or five generations decades of Moore's law right so expressiveness and efficiency and I don't know perhaps the environment that it came with as well which was Unix so it meant if you wrote a program it could be used on all those computers that ran UNIX and that was all of those computers because they were all written in C in that way it was UNIX the operating system itself was portable as where all the tools so it all worked together again and one of these things work things fit on each other in a positive cycle what did it take to write sort of a definitive book probably the definitive book on all of programs like it's more definitive to a particular language than any other book on any other language and did two really powerful things which is popularized the language and at least from my perspective maybe you can correct me and second is created a standard of how you know the how this language is supposed to be used and applied so what did it take did you have those kinds of ambitions in mind when we're working on that some kind of joke no of course not of the knacks it's an accident of timing skill and just luck a lot of it is clearly I timing was good now Denison I wrote the book in 1977 I miss ritchi yeah right and at that point UNIX was starting to spread I don't know how many there were but it would be dozens to hundreds of UNIX systems um and C was also available on other kinds of computers that had nothing to do with UNIX and so the language had some potential and there were no other books on C and Bell Labs was really the only source Ford and Dennis of course was authoritative because it was his language and he had written the reference manual which is a marvelous example of how to write a reference manual really really very very well done so I twisted his arm until he agreed to write a book and then we wrote a book and the virtue our advantage at least I guess if going first is that then other people have to follow you if they're gonna do anything and I think it worked well because Dennis's superb writer I mean he really really did and that the reference manual in that book is his period I had nothing to do with that at all so just crystal-clear prose and very very well expressed um and then he and I I wrote most of the expository material and then he and I sort of did the usual ping-pong game back and forth hum refining it but I spend a lot of time trying to find examples that would sort of hang together and they would tell people what they might need to know at about the right time that they should be thinking about needing it and I'm not sure it completely succeeded but it mostly worked out fairly well what do you think is the power of example I mean you're you're the creator at least one of the first people to do the hello world program just like the example if aliens discover our civilization hundreds of years from now they'll probably hello what other programs just like a half broken robot communicating with them with the hello world so what and that's a representative example so what what do you find powerful about examples but I think a good example will tell you how to do something and it will be representative of you might not want to do exactly that but you will want to do something that's at least in that same general vein and so a lot of the examples in the C book were picked for these very very simple straightforward text processing problems that were typical of UNIX I want to read input and write it again there's a copy command I want to read input and do something to it and write it out again there's a grep and so that kind of fine things that are representative of what people want to do and spell those out so that they can then take those and see the the core parts and modify them to their taste and I think that a lot of programming books that I don't look at programming books a tremendous amount these days but when I do a lot of don't do that they don't give you examples that are both realistic and something you might want to do some of them are pure syntax here's how you add three numbers well come on I could figure that I would tell me how I would get those three numbers into the computer and how he would do something useful with them and then how I put them back out again neatly formatted and especially if you follow that example there is something magical of doing something that feels useful yeah right and I think it's the attempt and it's absolutely not perfect but the attempt in all cases was to get something that was going to be either directly useful or would be very representative of useful things that a programmer might want to do but within that vein of fundamentally text processing reading text doing something writing text so you've also written a book on go language I'd have to admit so I worked at Google for a while and I've never used go not you miss something well I know I missed something for sure I mean yeah so go and rust the two languages that I hear very spoken very highly of night which I would like to try well there's a lot of them there's Julia there's there's all these incredible modern languages but if you can comment before or maybe comments on what do you find where does go stood in this broad spectrum of languages and also how do you yourself feel about this wide range of powerful interesting languages that you may never even get to try to explore of time so I think so go um go first comes from that same Bell Labs tradition in part not exclusively but two of the three creators Ken Thompson and Rob Michael literally the people yeah the people and then with this very very useful influence from the European School in particular the club spirit influence of through Robert Griesemer it was I guess a second generation down student at ETH and so that's an interesting combination of things and so some ways go captures the good parts of see it looks sort of like see it's sometimes characterized to see for the 21st century on the surface it looks very very much like see but at the same time it has some interesting data structuring capabilities and then I think the part that I would say is particularly useful and again I'm not a go expert in spite of co-authoring the book about 90% of the work was done by Alan Donovan and my co-author who is a go expert but go provides a very nice model of concurrency it's basically the cooperating communicating sequential processes that Tony Hoare set forth I don't know 40-plus years ago and go routines are to my mind a very natural way to talk about parallel computation and in the few experiments I've done with them they're easy to write and typically it's going to work and very efficient as well so I think that's one place where it go stands out at that model of parallel computation it's very very easy and nice just to comment on that do you think c4 saw or the early unique States foresaw threads and massively parallel computation I would guess not really I mean maybe it was seen but not at the level where it was something you had to do anything about for a long time processors got faster and then processors stopped getting faster because of things like power consumption and heat generation and so what happened instead was that instead of processors getting faster there started to be more of them and that's where that parallel thread stuff comes in so if you can comment on the the other languages is it break your heart that you'll never get to explore them of course how do you feel a lot of the full variety it's not break my heart but but I would love to be able to try more of these languages the closest I've come is in class that I often teach in the spring here it's a programming class and I often give I have one sort of small example that I will write in as many languages as I possibly can I've got it in 20 on languages at this point and and that's so I do a minimal experiment with on language just to say okay I have this trivial task which I understand the task and it should it takes 15 lines in awk and not much more in a variety of other languages so how big is it how fast does it run and what pain did I go through to learn how to do it and that's a it's like an Akita right it's a very very very narrowly like that so yeah but still it's a little sample because you get to I think the hardest step of the programming language is probably the first step right so there you're taking the first step yeah and from my experience um with some languages is very positive like Lua a scripting language I'd never used and I took my Britain little program the program is a trivial formatter it just takes in lines of text of varying lengths and it puts them out in lines that have no more than 60 characters on each line so think it was just kind of the flow of process in a browser or something so it's very short program and um in Lua I downloaded Lua and in an hour I had it working never having written Lua in my life just going with online documentation I did the same thing in Scala which you can think of as a flavor of Java equally trivial I did it in Haskell it took me several weeks but it did run like a turtle and and I did it in Fortran 90 and it painful but it worked and I tried it in rust and it took me several days to get it working because the model of memory manage it was just a little unfamiliar to me and the problem I had with rust and it's back to what we were just talking about I couldn't find good consistent documentation on rust now this was several years ago and I'm sure things have stabilized but at the time everything in the rust world seemed to be changing rapidly and so you would find what looked like a working example and it wouldn't work with the version of the language that I had so it took longer than it should have rust is a language I would like to get back to but probably won't I think one of the issues you have to have something you want to do if you don't have something that is the right combination if I want to do it and yet I have enough disposable time whatever to make it worse than learning a new language at the same time it's never going to happen so what do you think about another language of JavaScript that's this well let me just sort of comment on what I said when I was brought up sort of JavaScript pasina's the probably like the ugliest language possible and yet it's quite arguably quite possibly taking over not just the fun in the back end of the internet but possibly in the future taking over everything because they've now learned to make it very efficient yeah so what do you think about this yeah well I think you've captured it in a lot of ways when it first came out javascript was deemed to be fairly irregular in an ugly language and certainly in the academy if you said you were working on javascript people would ridicule you it was just not fit for academics to work on I think a lot of that has evolved the language itself has evolved and certainly the technology of compiling it is fantastically better than it was and so in that sense it's a absolutely a viable solution upon backends as well it's the front-end used well I think it's a pretty good language I've written a modest amount of it and I've played with JavaScript translators and things like that I'm not a real expert and it's hard to keep up even there with the new things that come along with it um so I don't know whether it will ever take over the world I think not but it it's certainly an important language and worth knowing more about theirs this may be to get your comment on something which javascript and actually most languages of Python such a big part of the experience of programming with those languages includes libraries sort of using building on top of the code that other people have built I think that's probably different from the experience that we just talked about from UNIX and C days when you're building stuff from scratch what do you think about this world of essentially leveraging building up libraries on top of each other and leveraging them yeah that's a very perceptive kind of question one of the reasons programming was fun in the old days was that you were really building it all yourself the number of libraries you had to deal with was quite small maybe it was printf or the standard library or something like that and that is not the case today and if you want to do something in you mentioned Python and JavaScript and those are the two finding examples you have to typically download a boatload of other stuff and you have no idea what you're getting absolutely nothing I've been doing some playing with machine learning over the last couple of days and G something doesn't work well you pip install this okay and down comes another gazillion megabytes of something and you have no idea what it was and if you're lucky it works and if it doesn't work you have no recourse there's absolutely no way you could figure out which in these thousand different packages and I think it's worse in the MPM NPM environment for JavaScript I think there's less discipline less control there and there's aspects of not just not understanding how it works but there's security issues is there Busta's issues so you don't want to run a nuclear power plant using JavaScript essentially oh probably not so it's speaking to the variety of languages do you think that variety is good or do you hope think that over time we should converge towards one two three programming languages that's you mentioned to the bailout days when people could sort of the community of it and the more languages you have the more you separate the communities is the Ruby there's the Python community there's C++ community do you hope that there they'll unite one day - just one or two languages I certainly don't hope it I'd not sure that that's right because I honestly don't think there is one language that will suffice for all the programming needs of the world are there too many at this point well arguably um but I think if you look at the sort of the distribution of how they are used there's something called a dozen languages that probably count for 95% of all programming at this point and that doesn't seem unreasonable and then there's another well 2000 languages that are still in use that nobody uses and or at least don't use in any quantity but I think new languages are a good idea in many respects because they're often a chance to explore an idea of how a language might help I think that's one of the positive things about functional languages for example they're a particularly good place where people have explored ideas that at the time didn't seem feasible but ultimately have wound up as part of mainstream languages as well let me just go back as early as recursion Lisp and then follow forward with functions as first-class citizens and pattern based languages and gee I don't know closures and just on and on and on lambdas interesting ideas that showed up first in let's call it broadly the functional programming community and then find their way into mainstream languages yes it's a playground for rebels yeah exactly and and so I think the language is in the playground themselves are probably not going to be the mainstream at least for some welp but the ideas that come from there are invaluable so let's go to something that when I found out recently so I known that you've done a million things but one of the things I wasn't aware of the you had a role in ample and I before you interrupt me by minimizing your role in it but your hapless for minimizing functions yeah minimizing functions right exactly I can't just say that the elegance and abstraction power of an ample is incredible all right when I first came to it about ten years ago or so can you describe what is the ample language sure so ample is a language for mathematical programming technical term think of it as linear programming that is setting up systems of linear equations that are some sort of system of constraints so that you have a bunch of things that have to be less than this greater than that or whatever and you're trying to find a set of values for some decision variables that will maximize or minimize some objective function so it's it's a way of solving a particular kind of optimization problem a very formal sort of optimization problem but one that's exceptionally useful and it specifies so there's objective function of constraints and variables that become separate from the data it operates on right so the that kind of separation allows you to you know put on different hats won't put the Hat of an optimization person and then put a another hat of a data person and dance back and forth and and also separate the actual solvers the optimization systems that do the solving then you can have other people come to the table and then build their solvers whether it's linear or nonlinear convex non convex that kind of stuff so what is the do use may be in common how you got into that world and what is a beautiful or interesting idea to you from the world of optimization sure so I preface it by saying I'm absolutely not an expert on this and most of the important work in and comes from my two partners in crime on that Bob Fuhrer who was a professor of and in the industrial engineering and management science department at Northwestern and my colleague at Bell Labs Dave Gay who is a numerical analysts an optimization person so the deal is linear programming preface this by saying linear program is the simplest example of this so linear program is taught in school is that you have a big matrix which is always called a and you say ax is less than or equal to B so B is a set of constraints X is the decision variables and a as to how the decision variables are combined to set up the various constraints so a as a matrix and X and B your vectors and then there's an objective function which is just the sum of a bunch of X's and some coefficients on them and yet that's the thing you want to optimize the problem is that in the real world that matrix a is a very very very intricate very large and very sparse matrix where the various components of the model are distributed among the coefficients in a way that is totally on obvious to anybody and so what you need is some way to express the original model which you and I would write you know we'd write mathematics on the board and the sum of this is greater than the sum of that kind of thing so you need a language to write those kinds of constraints and Bob for a long time had been interested in modeling languages languages that made it possible to do this there was a modeling language around called gams the general algebraic modeling system but it looked very much like Fortran was kind of clunky um and so Bob spent a sabbatical year at Bell Labs in 1984 and he and wasn't in the office across from me and it's always geography and he and Dave Gay and I started talking about this kind of thing and he wanted to design a language that would make it so that you could take these algebraic specifications you know summation signs over sets and that you would write on the board and convert them into basically this a matrix and then pass that off to a solver which is an entirely separate thing and so we talked about the design if the language I don't remember any of the details of this now but it's kind of an obvious thing you're just writing mathematical expressions in a Fortran like sorry in algebra but textual like language and I wrote the first version of this ample program my first C++ program and that's written in C++ yep and so I did that fairly quickly we wrote it was you know 3,000 lines or something so it wasn't very big but it just sort of showed the feasibility of it that you could actually do something that was easy for people to specify models and convert it into something that a solver could work with at the same time as you say that model and the data are separate thing so one model would then work with all kinds of different data in the same way lots of programs do the same thing but with different data so one of the really nice things is the the specification of the models human just kind of like as you say is human readable like I literally I'm ever on stuff I work I I would send it to colleagues that I'm pretty sure never programmed just just to understand what the optimization problem is I think how hard is it to convert that you said you there's a first prototype in C++ to convert that into something that could actually be used by the solver it's not too bad because most of the solvers have some mechanism that lets them import a model in AI form it might be as simple as the matrix itself in just some representation or if you're doing things that are not linear programming and there may be some mechanism that you provide things like functions to be called or other constraints on the model so so all ample does is to generate that kind of thing and then solver deals with all the hard work and then when the solver comes back with numbers and Vil converts those back into your original form so you know how much of each thing you should be buying or making or shipping or what so we did that in 84 and I haven't had a lot to do with it since except that we wrote a couple of versions of a book on which is one of the greatest books ever written I love that book I don't know why it's an excellent book but for wrote most of it and so it's really really well done he must be a dynamite teacher and typeset in late Dec no no no are you kidding I really like in the typography so I don't know we did it with tear off I don't even know what that is yeah exactly you could go I think of tear off is as a predecessor to the tech family of things it's a formatter that was done at Bell Labs in this same period of the very early 70s oh that predates tech and things like that plate mmm 5 to 10 years it was nevertheless they just I'm going by memories it was I remember it being beautiful yeah it was nice outside of UNIX Iago laying all the things we talked about all the amazing work you've done you've also done working graph theory let me ask this this crazy out there question if you had to make a bet and I had to force you to make a bet do you think P equals NP the answer is no although I've told that somebody asked Jeff Dean if that was the what conditions B would equal NP and he said either P is 0 or n is 1 or vice versa I've forgotten so but your intuition is I haven't no I have no intuition but I've got a lot of colleagues who've got intuition and their betting is no that's the popular that's the popular bet okay so what is computational complexity theory and do you think these kinds of complexity classes especially as you've taught in this modern world there are still a useful way to understand the hardness of problems I don't do that stuff the last time I touched anything to do with that was before it was invented because I it's literally true I did my PhD thesis on good for big on on tape you know absolutely before I I did this in 1968 and I worked on graph partitioning which is this question you've got a graph that is a nodes and edges kind of graph and the edges have weights and you just want to divide the nodes into two piles of equal size so that the number of edges that goes from one side to the other is as small as possible and we he developed so that problem is hard well as it turns out I work with Shen Lin at Bell Labs on this and we were never able to come up with anything that was guaranteed to give the right answer we came up with heuristics that worked pretty darn well and I peeled off some special cases for my thesis but it was just hard and that was just about the time that Steve Cooke was showing that there were classes of problems that appeared to be really hard of witchcraft partitioning was one but this my expertise such as it was totally predates that development Oh interesting so the the heuristic which now you're who cares the two of years names for the Traveling Salesman problem at for the graph partitioning that was like how did you you weren't even thinking in terms of classes you're just trying to was no such idea a heuristic that kind of does the job pretty well you were trying to find a something that did the job and there was no nothing that you would call let's say a closed-form or algorithmic thing that would give you a guaranteed right answer I mean compare graph partitioning to max-flow min-cut or something like that that's the same problem except there's no constraint on the number of nodes on one side or the other of the cut and that means it's an easy problem at least as I understand it whereas the constraint that says the two have to be constrained in size makes it a hard problem yes so the Robert Frost has that poem where you choose two paths so what why did you is there another alternate universe in which you pursued the Don Knuth path of you know algorithm designs and of not smart enough that's smart enough for you're infinitely modest but so you proceed you're kind of love of programming I mean when you look back to those I mean just looking into that world does that just seem like a distant world of theoretical computer science then is it fundamentally different from the world of programming I don't know I mean certainly in all series and as I just didn't have the talent for it I when I got here is a grad student to Princeton and I started to think about research at the end of my first year or something like that I work briefly with John Hopkins absolutely you know he mentioned during award-winner it said her a great guy and it became crystal clear I was not cut out for this stuff period okay and so I moved into things where I was more cut out for it and that tended to be things like writing programs and ultimately writing books you've said that in Toronto as an undergrad you did a senior thesis or literature survey on artificial intelligence this was 1964 correct what was the AI landscape ideas dreams at that time I think that was one of the well you've heard of AI winters this is whatever the opposite was AI summer or something there's one of these things where people thought that boy we could do anything with computers that all these hard problems we could computers will solve them they will do machine translation they will play games like chess that they will do mission you know prove theorems in geometry there are all kinds of examples like that where people thought boy we could really do those sorts of things um and you know I I read the kool-aid in some times it's a wonderful collection of papers called computers and thought that was published and about that era and people were very optimistic and then of course it turned out that what people thought was just a few years down the pike was more than a few years down the pike and some parts of that are more or less now sort of under control I we finally do play games like go and chess and so on better than then people do but there are others on machine translation is a lot better than it you to be but that's 50 close to 60 years of progress and a lot of evolution in hardware and a tremendous amount more data upon which you can build systems that actually can learn from some of that and and the the infrastructure to support developers working together like an open source moving the internet period is also an empowering but what lesson do you draw from that the opposite of winter that optimism well I guess the lesson is that in the short run it's pretty easy to be too pessimistic or maybe too optimistic and in the long run you probably shouldn't be too pessimist I'm not saying that very well it reminds me of this remark from Arthur Clarke science fiction author who says you know when some distinguished but elderly person says that something is him is possible he's probably right and if he says it's impossible he's almost surely wrong but you don't know what the time scale is at time scale is good all right so what are your thoughts on this new summer of AI now in the work with machine learning in your networks you've kind of mentioned he started to try to explore and look into this world that seems fundamentally different from the world of heuristics and algorithms like search that it's now purely sort of trying to take huge amounts of data and learn learn from that data right programs from the data no look I think it's it's very interesting I am incredibly far from an expert most of what I know I've learned from my students and they're probably disappointed in how little I've learned from them but um I think it has tremendous potential for certain kinds of things in games is one where it obviously has had an effect on some of the others as well I think there's and this is speaking from definitely not expertise I think there are serious problems in certain kinds of machine learning learning at least because what they're learning from is the data that we give them and if the data we give them has something wrong with it then what they learn from it is probably wrong too and the obvious thing is some kind of bias in the that the data has stuff in it like I don't know women earned as good at men as men at something okay that's just flat wrong but if it's in the data because of historical treatment then that machine learning stuff will propagate that and that is a serious worry the the positive part of that is what machine learning does is reveal the bias in the data and puts a mirror to our own society and in so doing helps us remove the bite you know helps us work on ourselves it's a mirror to ourselves yeah that's an optimistic point of view and if it works that way that would be absolutely great and and what I don't know is whether it does work that way or whether the the you know the AI mechanisms or machine learning mechanisms reinforce and amplify things that have been wrong in the past and I don't know I but I think that's a serious thing that we have to be concerned about let me ask you another question okay I know nobody knows but what do you think it takes to build a system of human level intelligence that's been the dream from the 60s we talk about games about language about about image recognition but really the dream is to create human level or superhuman level intelligence what do you think it takes to do that and are we close I haven't a clue and I don't know trying to trick you into a hypothesis I mean Turing talked about this in his paper on machine intelligence back and she's in early 50s or something like that and he had the idea of the Turing test and I don't know what the Turing test is I don't know it's an interesting test at least it's in some vague sense objective whether you can read anything into the conclusions is a different story do you have worries concerns excitement about the future of artificial intelligence so there's a lot of people for worried and you can speak broadly than just artificial intelligence is basically computing taking over the world in various forms are you excited by this future this possibility of computing being everywhere or are you worried it's some combination of those I I think almost all technologies over the long run are for good but there's plenty of examples where they haven't been good either over a long run for some people or over a short run um and computing is one of those and AI within it is gonna be one of those as well but computing broadly I mean for just a today example is privacy that um the use of things like social media and so on means that in the commercial surveillance means that there's an enormous amount more known about us by people other you know businesses government whatever then perhaps one ought to feel comfortable with so that's an example that's an example pause a possible negative negative effect of competing being everywhere it's a it's an interesting one because it could also be a positive leverage correctly there's a big if there so I I you know I've I have a deep interest in human psychology and humans are seem to be very paranoid about this data thing at a but that varies depending on age group yes it seems like the younger folks so it's exciting to me to see what society looks like fifty years from now that the concerns of our privacy might be flipped on their head based purely on human psychology versus actual concerns or not yeah what do you think about Moore's law well you said a lot of stuff we've talked you talked about what programming languages in their design and their ideas are come from the constraints and the systems they operate and do you think Moore's Law the the exponential improvement of systems will continue indefinitely there's there's mix of opinions on that currently or do you think do you think there will be do you think there'll be a plateau well the furball is answer there's no exponential can go on forever you run out of something um just as we said timescale matters so if it goes on long enough that might be all I need yeah right won't matter does uh so I don't know we've seen places where Moore's law has changed for example mentioned earlier process processors don't get faster anymore but you used that same growth of you know building put more things in a given area to grow them horizontally instead of vertically as it were so you can get more and more processors or memory or whatever on the same chip is that gonna run into a limitation presumably because you know at some point you get down to the individual atoms and so you got to find some way around that will we find some way around that I don't know I just said that if I say it I'll be wrong we will say I just talked to Jim Keller and he says so he actually describes he argues that the Moore's law will continue for a long long time because you mentioned the atom we actually have I think a thousandfold increase to a decrease in threaten transistor size still possible before we get to the quantum level so it's there's still a lot of possibilities he thinks he'll continue indefinitely which is an interesting optimistic optimistic viewpoint but how do you think the programming languages will change for this increase whether we hit a wall or not what do you think do you think there'll be a fundamental change in the way programming languages are designed I don't worry about that I think what will happen is continuation of what we see in some areas at least which is that more programming will be done by programs than by people and that more will be done by sort of declarative rather than procedural mechanisms where I say I want this to happen you figure out how and that is in many cases at this point domain of specialized languages for narrow domains but you can imagine that broadening out and so I don't have to say so much in so much detail some collection of software let's call it language or programs or something we'll figure out how to do what I want to do some increased levels of abstraction yeah and one day getting to the human level maybe just use so you taught so teach of course computers in our world here at Princeton that introduces computing and programming to non majors what just from that experience what advice do you have for people who don't know anything about programming but I'm kind of curious about this world or programming seems to become more and more of a fundamental skill that people need to be at least the world yeah well I could recommend a good book what's that for the course I think this is one of these questions of should everybody know how to program and I think the answer is probably not but I think everybody should at least understand sort of what it is so that if you say to somebody I'm a programmer they have a notion of what that might be or if you say this is a program or this was decided by a computer running a program that they have some vague intuitive understanding and an accurate understanding of what that might imply so part of what I'm doing in this course which is very definitely for non-technical people I mean typical person in it is a history or English major try and explain how computers work how they do their thing what programming is how you write a program and how computers talk to each other and what do they do when they're talking to each other and then I would say nobody very rarely and does anybody in that course go on to become a real serious programmer but at least they've got a somewhat better idea of what all this stuff is about not just the programming but the technology behind computers and communications do they write up do they try and write a program themselves oh yeah yeah a very small amount I introduced them to how machines work at a level below high-level languages so we have a kind of a toy machine and has a very small repertoire dozen instructions and they write trivial assembly language program Wow that's okay just if you were to give a flavor to people of the programming world for the competing world what what are the examples it should go with so a little bit of assembly to get a sense at the lowest level of what the program is really doing yeah there's I mean in some sense there's no such thing as the lowest level because you can keep going down but that's the place where I drew the line so the idea that computers have a fairly small repertoire of very simple instructions that they can do like add and subtract and and branch and so on as you mentioned earlier and that you can write code at that level and it will get things done and then you have the levels of abstraction that we get with higher-level languages like Fortran or C or whatever and that makes it easier to write the code and less dependent on particular architectures and then we talk about a lot of the different kinds of programs that they use all the time that they don't probably realize our programs like they're running Mac OS on their computers or maybe Windows and they're downloading apps on their phones and all of those things are programs that are just what we just talked about except at a grand scale it's easy to forget that they're actual programs that people program there's engineers they wrote wrote those things yeah right and so in a way I'm expecting them to make an enormous conceptual leap from their 5 or 10 line toy assembly language thing that adds two or three numbers to you know something that is a browser on their phone or whatever but but it's really the same thing if you look at the broad and broad strokes at history what do you think the world like how do you think the world change because of computers it's hard to sometimes see the big picture when you're in it you know but I guess I'm asking if there's something you've noticed over the years that like you were mentioned the students are more distracted looking at their now there's a device to look at right well I think computing has changed its rendus amount and obviously but I think one aspect of that is the way that people interact with each other both locally and faraway and when I was you know the age of those kids making a phone call to somewhere was a big deal because it cost serious money and this was in the 60s right and today people don't make phone calls they send texts or something like that so it there's a up and down and what people do people think nothing of having correspondence regular meetings video whatever with friends or family or whatever in any other part of the world and they don't think about that at all they and so that's just the communication aspect of it and do you think that brings us closer together or does it make us do this does it take us away from the closeness of human human contact I think it depends a lot on all kinds of things so I trade mail with my brother and sister in Canada much more often than I used to talk to them on the phone so probably every 2 or 3 days I get something or send something to them whereas 20 years ago I probably wouldn't have talked to them on the phone nearly as much so in that sense I that's brought my brother and sister and I closer together that's a good thing um I watch the kids on campus and they're mostly walking around with their heads down fooling with their phones to the point where I have to duck them yeah I don't know that that has brought them closer together in some ways there's sociological research that says people are in fact not as close together as they used to be I don't know whether that's really true but but I can see potential downsides and kids where you think come on wake up and smell the coffee or whatever that's right but if you look at again nobody can predict the future but are you excited kind of touch this a little bit with with AI but are you excited by the future in the next 10 20 years the computing will bring you viewer there when there was no computers really and now computers are everywhere all over the world and Africa and Asia and just every every person almost every person the wall has a device so are you hopeful optimistic about that future I it's mixed if the truth be told I mean I think there are some things about that that are good I think there's the potential for people to improve their lives all over the place and that's obviously good and at the same time at least in the short time short-run you can see lots and lots of bad as people become more tribalistic or parochial in their interests and it's an enormous amount more us and them and people are using computers in all kinds of ways to mislead or misrepresented or flat-out lie about what's going on and that is affecting politics locally and I think everywhere in the world yeah the the long-term effect on political systems and so on it's who knows knows indeed the the the people now have a voice which is a powerful thing people who are press have a voice but also everybody has a voice and the chaos that emerges from that is fascinating to watch yeah yeah it's kind of scary if you can go back and relive a moment in your life one that made you truly happy outside of family or was profoundly transformative is there a moment or moments that jump out at you from memory I don't think specific moments I think there were lots and lots and lots of good times at Bell Labs where you would build something and it it worked hi Jase a work so the moments at war who stood yeah and and somebody used it from they said gee that's neat those kinds of things happened quite often in that sort of golden era and that the 70s when UNIX was young and there was all this low-hanging fruit and interesting things to work on a group of people who kind of we were all together in this and if you did something they would try it out for you and I think that was in some sense a really really good time and Ock was a was an example of that then you drilled it and people use that yeah absolutely and now millions of people use any and all your stupid mistakes right there for them to look at so it's mixed yeah it's terrifying vulnerable buds beautiful because it does have a positive impact on so so many people so I think there's no better way to end it Brian thank you so much for talking it was an honor okay likes it my pleasure good fun thank you for listening to this conversation with Brian Kernighan and
