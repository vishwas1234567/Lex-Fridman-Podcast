for just being somebody who puts love out there in the world and being genuinely curious about wild ideas from chimps and psychedelics to quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence like many of you

ads in the middle but this time let's go straight to the conversation with a bit of guitar first [Music] do you ponder your mortality are you afraid of death i i do think about it sometimes i mean it does pop into my head sometimes just the fact that uh i mean i'm 53 so if everything goes great i have less than 50 years left you know if everything goes great like no car accidents no injuries but it could happen today this could be your last day it could be that's kind of a stoic thing to meditate on death there's a there's a bunch of philosophers ernest becker and uh sheldon solomon they believe that death is the at the core of everything wrote this book warm at the core so does that come into play in the way you see the world i think having a sense of urgency is very beneficial and understanding that your time is limited can aid you greatly i think knowing that this is a temporary time that we we have finite life spans i i think there's a there's great power in that because it it motivates you it gets you going i think being an immortal living forever would be one of the most depressing things particularly if everybody else was dying around you and i think one of the things that makes life so interesting and fascinating is that it doesn't last you know that you you really get a brief amount of time here and really by the time you're just starting to kind of figure yourself out who you are and how not to screw things up so bad it's like time's up the ride's over what about from your like from your daughter's perspective do you do you uh think about the world where and now and what kind of world you're going to leave them i do you worry about it i do yeah i do i do when i see these uh protests and riots and chaos and so much so much uh anger in the world today and then particularly today i think because of the the pandemic and the fact that so many folks are out of work and through no fault of their own and can't make ends meet and just people feel so helpless and angry it's uh a particularly divisive time it's a particularly turmoil filled time and uh it just doesn't seem like the world of a year ago even just feels very chaotic and dangerous and this and it's a small thing like in terms of the like the possibilities of things that could happen to the world like a pandemic like the one we've experienced it really just doubles the amount of deaths on a bad flu year so it relatively speaking is a small thing comparison to super volcano eruptions asteroid impact a real horrific pandemic or one that you know really wipes out millions and millions of people it's um it's stunning how fragile civility is it's stunning how fragile our our society really is that something like this can come along some unprecedented thing unprecedented thing can come along and all of a sudden everybody's out of work for six months and then everybody's at each other's throats and then politically everyone's at each other's throats and and then with the advent of social media and uh the images that you can see you know with the videos of police abuse and just racial tensions are an all-time high to a point where like if you asked me just five or six years ago like are have racial problems in this country largely been alleviated i'd probably say yeah it's way better than it's ever been before but now you could argue that it's not now you could argue it's no it's way worse in just a small amount of time it's way worse than it's ever been during my lifetime you cut well while i'm aware of it you know obviously when i was a young boy in the 60s they were still going through the civil rights movement but now uh it just seems very fever-pitched and i think a lot of that is because of the pandemic and is because of all the the heightened uh just tension the one i liken it to is um road rage because you know people have road rage not just because they're in the car no one can get to them but also because you're at a heightened state because you're driving fast and you know you're driving fast you know you have to make split-second movements and so anybody doing something like what people go crazy because they're they're already at an eight because they're in the car and they're moving very quickly that's what it feels like with today with the pandemic feels like everybody is already at an eight so anything that comes along it's like light it all on fire you know burn it down like that's part of what i think is part of the reason for a lot of the looting and the riots and all the chaos it's not just the people out of work but it's also that everyone feels so tense already and everyone feels so helpless and it's like you know doing something like that makes people uh it just it gives people a a whole new motivation for chaos a whole new motivation for for doing destructive things that i've never experienced in my life and your better days when you see a positive future what do you think is the way out of this chaos of 2020 like if you visualize at 2025 that's a better world than today what is that how do we get there what does that look like it's a good question i do i i can honestly say i don't know and uh i wouldn't have said i don't know a year ago a year ago i would have said we're going to be okay as much people hate trump the upon economy is doing great i think we're going to be fine that's not how i feel today today i don't think there's a a clear solution politically because i think if trump wins people are going to be furious and i think if biden wins people are going to be furious um and particularly like if things get more woke you know if people uh continue to enforce this uh forced compliance and make people behave a certain way and act a certain way which seems to be a part of what this whole woke thing is that is the most disturbing for me is that i see what's going on i see there's a lot of losers that have hopped on this and they they shove it in people's faces and it doesn't have to make sense like there was a black lives matter protest that stopped this woman at a restaurant they were surrounding her outside a restaurant they were forcing her to raise her fist in compliance this is a woman who's marched for black lives multiple times black lives matter multiple times and the people around her doing this were all white yeah it's all it's all weird my friend coach t he's a wrestling coach also uh on a podcast my friend brian moses his take on it is that black and he's a black guy he says black lives matter's a white cult and i'm like when you see that picture it's hard to argue that he's got a point it's clearly not all about that but there's a lot of people that have jumped on board that are very much like cult members because the thing about black lives matter or any movement is you can't control who joins there's no entrance uh examination so you don't go okay how do you feel about this what's your perceptions on that like how you like the the man who shot the trump supporter in portland you know that guy who murdered the trump supporter then the cop shot him that guy was walking around with his hand on his gun looking for trump supporters just want i mean he's a known violent guy who was walking around looking for trump supporters found one and shot one that has nothing to do with black lives matter he's a white guy he shot another white guy it's just it's just madness you know and then that kind of madness is uh it's disturbing to see it ramp up so quickly i mean there's been there's been riots in portland every night oh excuse me demonstrations for 101 days now 101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire breaking into federal buildings it's like whoever saw that coming nobody saw that coming so i don't know what the solution is and i don't know what it looks like in five years so 2025 to answer your question like it could be anything i mean we could be looking at mad max we could be looking at the apocalypse we could we could also be looking at an invasion from another country we could be looking at a war like a real hot war to put a little bit of responsibility on you like for me i've listened to you since the red band olive garden days that's the very beginning and uh there was something in the way you communicate about the world maybe there was others but you're the one i was aware of is you're open-minded and uh like loving towards the world especially as the podcast developed like you just demonstrated and lived this kind of just kindness or maybe even like lack of jealousy in your own little profession of comedy it was clear that you didn't you didn't succumb to the weaker aspects of human nature and thereby inspire like people like me who i was i was naturally probably especially in like the 20s early 20s kind of jealous on the success of others and you're really the primary person that taught me to um truly celebrate the success of others and so by way of question you kind of have a role in this of making a better 2025 you have such a big megaphone is there something you think you can do on this podcast with the words the way you talk the the things you discuss that could create a better 2025 i think if anything i could help in leading by example but you know that's only going to help the people that are listening i don't know what else i can do in terms of like make the world a better place other than express my hopes and wishes for that and just try to be as nice as i can to people as often as i can but i also think that i've fallen into this weird category particularly with the spotify deal where um you know i'm one of them now i'm not a regular person anymore now i'm like some famous rich guy so you go from being a regular person to a famous rich guy that's out of touch you know and uh that that's a real issue whenever you're talking about the economy about just real life problems it's it's interesting it kind of hurts my heart to hear people say about elon musk he's just a billionaire yeah it's an interesting statement but i think if you just continue being you and he continue being him people people i think people are just voicing their worry that you become some rich guy i don't even know if they're doing that i think they're just finding the way he describes it an attack vector right yeah and i think he's right i think they just uh they can dismiss you by just saying oh you're you're just a that you know you're a you know you're easily uh definable right but there i mean there's truth to that you if you're not careful you can become out of touch but you that that's an interesting thing like how why haven't you become out of touch like as a human off the podcast you you don't act like uh like you you talk to somebody like me you don't talk like a famous person or you you don't you don't act rich like you're better than others there's a certain listen i've talked to quite a few you have too but i've talked to especially kind of group of people that like nobel prize winners let's say they have sometimes have an error to them of arrogance yeah and you don't what's that about well you got to know what that is right like um that air of arrogance comes from drinking your own kool-aid you you start believing that somehow another just because you're getting praise from all these people that you really are something different usually it exemplifies there's there's something there there's where there's a lack of struggle you know and i think uh struggle is probably one of the most important balancing tools that a person can have and for me um i struggle mentally and i struggle physically i struggle mentally in that i like we were talking about on the podcast we did previously you and i on my podcast said i'm not a fan of my work i'm not a fan of what i do i'm my harshest critic so anytime anybody says something bad about me i'm like listen i said way worse about myself i you know i don't like anything i do i'm ruthlessly introspective and i will continue to be that way because that's the only way you could be good as a comedian there's no other way you can't just think you're awesome and just go out there you have to you have to be like picking apart everything you do but there's a balance to that too because you have to have enough confidence to go out there and perform you can't think oh my god i suck i know what i'm doing but i know what i'm doing because i put in all that work and one of the reasons why i put in all that work is i don't like the i don't like the end result most of the time so i need to work at it all the time and then there's physical struggle which i think balances everything out without physical struggle i i've i always make the analogy that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery where if you have extra charge it's like it leaks out of the top and it becomes unmanageable and messy and that's how my psyche is if i if i have too much energy if i'm not if i'm not exerting myself in a violent way like an explosive way like wearing myself out i just don't like the way the world is i don't like the way i interface with the world i'm too tense i'm i'm i'm i'm too quick to be upset about things up to but when i work out hard and you know i put in a brutal training session everything's fine well the first time i talked to you on jerry uh you were doing up to um so sober october and there's something in your eyes uh like i think you've talked about that you you know you exercise the demons out essentially so you exercise to get whatever the parts of you that you don't like out uh there is a dark there's a darkness in you there like the the competitiveness and the focus of that person that was a scary time in a lot of ways that sober october thing because uh my friends were all talking [ __ ] right because we're competing against each other and these fitness challenges and you had uh one point poor like you got a certain amount of points for each minute that you went at 80 percent of your max heart rate and one day i got 1100 points so i did seven hours on an elliptical machine watching the bathhouse scene from john wick where he murders all those people i watched him probably 50 times in a row i went crazy i went crazy but i went crazy in a weird way where it brought me back to my um my fighting days it was like the same that person came out again it's like well i didn't even know he was in there it's like they're like like like an assassin like a killer like i felt i felt like i felt like a like a different person is it echoes of like what mike tyson talked about essentially like the but no orgasm in their oceans all the crazy [ __ ] that he was is there is there that is there a violent person in there oh yeah yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of violence in me for sure i don't know if it's genetic or learned or it's because during my formative years from the time i was 15 until i was 22 all i did was fight that was all i did that was all i did all i did was train and compete that's all i did that was my whole life is it connected to uh so you uh your mom and dad broke up early on is it connected to the dad at all i i'm sure it's connected to him also because he was violent and it made me feel very scared to be around him but i also think um it's connected in who he was as a human is transferred into my dna you know i think there's a certain amount of i mean i mean to be prejudiced against myself i look like a violent person you know if i didn't know me i'm just even the way i'm built and not even just the working out bar just the size of my hands and like there's the width of my shoulders like there's most likely a lot of violence in my history in my past and my ancestry and i think um i think we minimized that with people like so much of your behavior like when i see my daughter i have a one daughter that's obsessive in terms of like she wants to get really good at things like could she and she'll practice things all day long and and it's 100 my personality like she's me in a female form but without the anger as much and without the um fear like she's you know loving household and everything like that but she has this intense obsession with doing things and doing things really well and getting better what's the point we have to tell her to stop like stop doing handsprings in the house stop stop come on just sit down have dinner like one more one more like she's just like she's like she's psycho yeah um and i think there's a lot of behavior and personality and a lot of these things are passed down through genetics we don't really know right we don't know how much of who you are genetically is learned behavior you know nature and nurture we don't know if it's learned behavior or whether or not it's something that's intrinsically a part of you because of you know who your parents were i think there's there's certainly some genetic violence in me there's something you channeled it yeah you figured out is basically your life it's a productive exploration of how to channel that yes try how to figure out how to get get that monkey to sit down and calm down there's another person in there like this is a calm rational kind friendly person who just wants to laugh and have fun and then there's that dude who comes out when i did sober october that guy's scary i don't like that guy yeah a guy just wants to get up in the morning and go you know it's like it's um i mean when i was competing it was necessary but it makes me remember i didn't really remember what a what i used to be like until that it's like when i'm working out seven hours a day yeah and just so obsessed and and all i was thinking about was winning that's all i was thinking about like if they were if they were working out five hours a day i wanted i wanted them to know that i was going to work out an extra three hours and i was going to get up early and i was going to text them all hey [ __ ] i'm up already taking pictures send selfies you know i was like you're going to die i kept telling them you're all going to die and try to keep up with me you're going to die you weren't fully joking no i wasn't joking at all that's what i was [ __ ] up about it was the scary thing when i interacted with goggins and what i saw in you on during that time is like this guy like like this is why i've been avoiding dave ganga's recently [Laughter] is like because he wants to meet he has to do like talk on this podcast but he also wants to run an ultra marathon with me and i felt like this is a person if i spend any time in this realm if i spend any time with the joe rogan of that sober october like i might have to die to get out like there's this kind of uh yeah there's a competitive aspect that's super unhealthy i mean you saw the video that we watched earlier today of goggins draining his knee that would stop me from running ever again because i would think in my head okay i'm gonna ruin my cartilage i'm gonna need a knee replacement i would start thinking i would go down that line but he is perpetually in this push-it mindset you know what he talk calls the dog in him you know he's got that dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog you know and that's um that's who he is that's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational and he's fuel for millions and millions of people i mean he really is he motivates people in a way that is so powerful but it can be very destructive i just i know i know now especially after the sober october thing that that thing's still in me you know i didn't know because i really haven't done anything physically competitive except one time i was supposed to fight wesley snipes it came out then too that came out too that got creepy too but luckily that never happened but that was many months of training like training twice a day every day kickboxing in the morning jiu jitsu at night i was just going going and going and going and i was just thinking just all day long and it but it [ __ ] with all the other aspects of your life [ __ ] with your friendships [ __ ] with your your [ __ ] with my comedy [ __ ] with everything because that mindset is not a mindset of an artist it's a mindset of a conqueror the concur yeah destroyer that's why it's so interesting to see mike tyson make the switch it's clear that like whatever that is however that fight goes he made us there's a switch of a dif he stepped into a different dimension roy jones jr is coming on my podcast soon and uh you know roy's gonna be on uh before the fight i'm i'm so curious to see how it goes down but genuinely concerned because mike tyson is a heavyweight and roy jones at his best was 168 pounds and um i don't know if roy has that room in his house mental house of where mike tyson goes i don't know i don't know if he has a rope mike doesn't have a room he's he's got an empire in there with the open side the door there's a whole empire in his head and he's he's in that firmly you know when he got out of the weed and and started training again like you could see it in him and by the way physically in person he looks spectacular he looks like a [ __ ] adonis i mean he looks ready to go yeah it's crazy yeah i watch the videos of him what about you uh have you ever considered competing in jiu jitsu no for that very reason i don't want to get obsessed that's my my number one concern i had to quit video games yeah when we were playing video games at the studio i had to quit because i was playing five hours a day like out of nowhere all of a sudden i was playing five hours a day i was coming home late for dinner i was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games and playing i get obsessed with things and i have to recognize what that is and these competitive things like competitive especially like really exciting competitive things like video games they're very dangerous for me the ultimate competitive video game is like jiu jitsu and um if i was young i most certainly would have done it if i didn't have like a very clear career path it was something that i enjoyed my concern would be that i would become a professional jiu jitsu fighter when i was young and then i would not have the energy to do stand up and do all the other things that i wound up doing as a career when i was um 21 i quit my job teaching i was teaching at boston university i was teaching taekwondo there and i i knew and i also had my own school in revere i knew i couldn't do it right and also be doing stand-up comedy i knew i couldn't do both of those things there was no way you have to be cognizant of uh that obsessive force within you to make sure uh yes i i have to know how to manage my mental illness right that's that's a very particular mental illness and i think that mental illness again my formative years from 15 until i was you know 21-ish 22 those those years were spent constantly obsessed with martial arts that was my whole day i mean i trained almost every day the only time i would not train is if i was either injured or if i was exhausted if i needed a day off but i was obsessed and so that part of my personality that i haven't nurtured is always going to be there under the surface and when you it gets reignited by something it's very weird it's a weird feeling and it can get reignited with a video game it can get reignited with anything that that obsessive that you know whatever it is that competitive demon yeah the way you talk about guitar i know you would love fall in love with playing guitar but i think you're very wise to not touch that thing that's why i want golf i have friends who want to golf i'm like [ __ ] with that thing so a lot of people ask me about uh like what's uh joe rogan's jiu jitsu game like like like like assuming that i i somehow spend uh hours rolling with you before and after we interact i mean what's a good uh you should at some point show a technique or something that'll be fun sure i mean i've got what's your game what's your name oh there i saw i saw you doing a i think had an arm uh something online yeah i did that was i [ __ ] my neck i'm doing head and arm chokes i did them so much that i i you know because you use your neck so much with head and arms chokes i developed like a real kink in my neck and uh it turned out i had a bulging disc and uh you know so you do it on that just one side well it was uh no i could do it on the left side but i definitely am better on the right side the right side was my best side so if you were to compete let's say like what's your a game what would you go from standing up how would you go to submission would you pull guard would you take down what how would you pass guard what's i don't have good takedowns i mean i was not a good wrestler so i would most likely either pull guard or i would pull half guard do you have a good guard yes are you comfortable being on your butt on your back yes i'm very i'm very flexible so i have good my rubber guard is pretty you go to right yeah i have good arm bars and good triangles off my back but um i also have a very good half guard but my top game is my best i have i have a very strong top game you have a hashtag card you have a preference of like what kind of guard and how to pass that guard and uh like yeah like is there a specific game plan like you would you double under hooks from half guard is the game plan for me if i can get double underhooks from half guard i could sweep a lot of people under hooks of what sorry the arms are so half guard lock down right half card go into lock down double under hooks got it clinched to the body suck the body into the type pressure and yeah massive pressure and then inch my way into a position we call the dog fight and inch my way to a position where i could get the person on their back yeah that's what because you did show me i still disagree with you about the thai thing um that you can choke so wrong so wrong uh well it's not wrong with you with you it's wrong because you you know i think there's a system where i i've have this thing with donna here we're gonna figure it out okay but uh let's have a little velcro in the back let's see that's you're just not cheating you're not you're the exact that's cheating uh yeah you did i did feel when you showed me i think you showed me the rubber guard because it's still a god that's a little bit foreign to me i just felt that you can immediately feel not with the rubber guard just but the way you move your body is you're um like a shanji type of guy who knows how to control another human being so like some people are a little bit more i would say agile and technic like playful and kind of loose loose and they work on transition transition transition you're a control guy like you know how to control position in an advanced position donahue is the same way he's all about control my game is smush that's my game smush you grab a hold of you once i have you why would i let you go that's my thought is like why would i let you go i just want to incrementally move to a better position until i can strangle you but i'm much more into strangling people than anything else yeah which is a great mma approach for jiu jitsu well too many people don't tap when you get their arms you know and i'm it's not i'm not opposed to arm bars i love arm bars but everybody goes to sleep yep and and quit from pressure too i mean yeah quit mentally that's nothing like you can't breathe you know if you got a guy who's like a really good top game guy and he mounts you and i'm a big fan of mounting with my legs crossed you know like a guard like a top guard and so i can squeeze with both legs smush and i'm just i'm just looking for people to make mistakes and slowly incrementally bettering my position until i can get something locked up yeah i love jiu jitsu though man i just wish it didn't injure you yeah you know jiu-jitsu is like if your joints were more durable they could figure out a way to make joints more durable god i could do jiu jitsu forever yeah so much fun i actually i talked to this uh roboticist russ tedrick he builds one of the world-class people that builds humanoid robots you're interested in boston dynamics yeah they keep people in that kind of robotics so i asked him the stupidest question of like how far are we we from uh having a robot be a ufc champion and uh yeah it's actually a really really tough problem it's it's it's the same thing that you know makes somebody like danielle comey like on the wrestling side special because you have to understand the movement of the human body in ways that so difficult to teach it's so it's so subtle the timing the pressure points like the leverage all those kinds of things that's just for the clinch situation and then the movement for the striking is very difficult as long as you're not allowed as a robot to like use your natural abilities of having a lot more power right a lot more power and more durable right the human body like especially meniscus like like you see the the heel hook game like everybody's involved in leg locks and heel hooks like all those guys wind up with torched knees everyone's got torched knees everyone's knees are torn apart you and you don't grow new meniscus you know that's like one of those joints where man when it goes this is and those guys are 28 years old blown out knees let me ask the ridiculous question what do you think we're talking about cops what do you think uh is the best martial arts for self-defense for sure jiu-jitsu yeah wrestling right i think grappling i should say with judo as well especially in a cold climate if you get someone who's got like a heavy winter jacket on my god like judo is an incredible plus concrete that's the worst place to be with a heavy winter jacket with a judo specialist and you're standing up with them oh my god but i think grappling because in most self-defense situations it usually winds up with grappling you're definitely better off though knowing some striking because there's nothing more terrifying than when you go to take someone down they actually have takedown skills but they can fight and so they have takedown defense and they know how to fight and then you don't know how to stand up like the worst thing in the world seeing someone like reaching who doesn't know how to do striking and someone cracks you what about all that krav maga talk which is like you know the whole line of argument that says that jiu jitsu and wrestling and all these sports they fundamentally take you away from the nature of violence so they're just teaching you how to play versus the reality of of um violence that is involved in like a self-defense situation that is is a totally different set of skills would be needed in general the people that say that jiu-jitsu or other martial arts don't they it's more of a sport and they don't really understand and they don't really understand violence in general the people that say that suck yeah that's anybody who thinks like someone's like you know hey man i'll just bite you i'm like are you gonna bite me okay do you think i'm gonna bite you too what do you think of that what if i punch you in your [ __ ] face you think you're still gonna bite me when you can't even see yeah when you you you barely even know you're alive and i choke you unconscious if someone's really good at jiu jitsu good luck stabbing them with your keys you know you don't have a chance you don't have a chance if someone's much better you and they trip you and get you on your back and then they [ __ ] elbow you in your face and get a head and arm choke on you all that krav maga it's out the window son you're way better off learning what works on train killers like this whole idea that you're going to poke some of the eye and then you're going to kick him in the nuts and like you're you're going through these drills that yeah it's good to know what to do if you run into someone who doesn't know how to fight it's way better to know what to do to someone who knows how to fight that's the best thing learn how to fight against people who know how to fight like all that practice self-defense and they're gonna it's gonna come at you with a knife you're gonna grab the wrist and do that like it's good to know self-defense but it's much more important to understand martial arts comprehensively when you understand martial arts comprehensively like there's no crop i shouldn't say there's no krav maga guys but it's it would be shocking if a krav maga guy and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight and the mixed martial arts guy was a trained killer all around didn't [ __ ] that guy up that's that's what i would expect would happen i would i would i would not think that some guy who has a little bit of this and a little bit of that and prepares for the streets is going to be able to handle a person who trains with killers on a day-to-day basis who rolls with jiu jitsu black belts who trains with muay thai champions like here it's the best martial arts of the martial arts that work on martial artists not the martial arts that work on untrained people what about we're in texas now what about guns that's the best martial art no but would you like uh in this crazy time should people carry guns it's not a bad idea to have a gun because if you need a gun you have a gun and if you don't need a gun if you're a person with self-control you're not going to use it you're not going to just randomly use it but you have something to protect you this is the whole idea of the second amendment the whole idea of the second amendment gets distorted by mass shootings or by terrible people murder people and do terrible things but it's that's all those things are real but they don't take away from the fundamental efficacy of having a firearm and defending your family or defending your life and there are real live situations where people have had firearms and it's protected them or their loved ones or they've stopped shooters there's there's many of these stories but people don't like those stories because then it it tends to lead to this gun culture argument is pro-gun culture argument that people find very uncomfortable it's it's human beings are messy and we're messy in so many different ways right we're messy uh emotionally we're messy messy physically but we're also messy in what's good or bad what's we want things to be binary we want things to be right or wrong you know one or zero and they're not but but there is crime in the world and there is violence in the world and you're better off knowing how to fight and you're betting better off knowing how to defend yourself and you're better off having a gun and yeah i generally think that guns i do like the idea that guns second amendment helps protect the first amendment there's a kind of sense that makes puts me at ease knowing that so many people in this country have guns that uh i mean alex jones i just listened to one episode of infowars for the first time boy is he he reminds me like when i drank some tequila i felt like i'm going to some dark places today that's how i feel like listening to him but uh he talks about like that it's he worries about martial law so basically government overreach by which happened throughout history like there's there's something to worry about there but it's it puts me at ease knowing that so much of the population has guns that people government would think twice before uh instituting martial law on cities but i actually was asking almost like on the individual level i maybe shouldn't say this but i don't yet own a gun and i felt that if i carry a gun statistically just for me as a human knowing my psychology i feel like i'm more likely to die like i feel like i would put myself in situations that i shouldn't like the way i i will see the world will change because my natural feeling is like when somebody when i was in philly and i knew late at night in west philly when some guy looks at you you can immediately calculate that this is a dangerous human being there it starts with a monkey look at first like i'm a bigger monkey than you and that's where i found like for example i'll do the beta thing of just looking down and turning away and just getting out of trouble like very politely and basically that kind of approach because if you have a in terms of getting out of serious violence situations like serious something where you could die versus if i had a gun i feel like i would want to be that that would be that cowboy monkey thing where i would want to put myself in situations where i'm a little bit of a savior even of myself and almost create danger which can no longer like the escalation of which i can no longer control well you're talking about taking a gun somewhere versus having a gun in your home yes yes i mean carry on me that's a different situation and much harder to get a warrant for or a license for that you know control concealed carry licenses especially in massachusetts they don't come easy a little message yeah that's a whole nother thing yeah you're saying gun in the home yeah a gun in the home having a gun having knowing how to use a gun like i know how to use a gun i've trained you know many hours learning how to shoot a gun at tactical places you know there's a bunch of videos of me doing it on uh instagram i i practice and i think it's good to to understand how to be accurate so i've been a fan of your podcast for a long time you don't often talk about it because you're always kind of looking forward but if you look at the old studio they just left is there some epic memories that stand out to you that you like you almost look back i can't believe this happened oh yeah almost too many of them to count is that something that pops into mine now all of them elon musk blowing that flamethrower in the middle of the hallway i got a video of that have you seen the video of it yeah yeah i think you posted on instagram i think i did too yeah he's a madman um having bernie sanders in there uh you know just uh all the fun fight companions we did and all the crazy podcasts with joey diaz and duncan trussell and there were so many there were so many moments you know it's um podcast is this is a weird art form and it almost seems like it sounds silly but it almost seems like something that chose me rather than i chose it i think of that all the time in some strange way it's like i'm i'm showing up as like an antenna and i just plug in and twist twist on and then i i take in the thing and i put it together and i'm like a passenger of this weird ride yeah you you've talked about this before i really like this idea of that human beings are just carriers of these ideas yeah ideas are the ones who are breeding yeah in a sense like the idea found you as a useful brain to use to spread itself through the podcasting medium yeah something that that's a on uh but did because when i think about your podcast i think about joey diaz i think about all those comedians you've had i mean i think you've had joey on i mean maybe close to 50 times some crazy number is there i mean he's over the top offensive just that's who he is to the core is there some sense where you you wondered like whether it's right to have the spotify episode number one with duncan dressler that's why we wore nasa suits and we got high as [ __ ] it's like that's the whole idea behind it i mean can you introspect that a little bit like can you think like what is that because that's rare it's such a rare thing to do because they they're you're not supposed to talk to duncan trussell with a huge platform that you have five hours why not because donald trump apparently watches your podcast so so just the idea that there's these i mean that's what i think about you know these ceos write to me that they listen to the podcast that that i do and i have somebody like a david fravor and i was nervous about it i was nervous to have a conversation for me david fravor is a duncan trestle which is like just because of his experiences with the ufos yeah just even just the way he sees the world because he is open i don't know if he's always like this but he opened himself to the possibility of unconventional ideas most people in the scientific community kind of say well i don't really want to believe anything that doesn't have a lot of hard evidence right and so that was to me like a step and as the thing somehow becomes more popular that it becomes this fear of like well should i talk to this person or not and i mean you're an inspiration and saying like do whatever the hell you want you have to well first of all i have what you call [ __ ] you money and if you have [ __ ] you money you don't say [ __ ] you what's the point of having the [ __ ] you money you're wasting it like you're wasting the position like someone said to me like why do you why do you like sports cars so much like how many cars do you have a bunch of cars so because if i was a kid and i said hey if i was that crazy rich famous guy like i don't want to have a bunch of cool [ __ ] cars like so i so i would do that like because that not everybody gets to do that like if you're the person that gets to do that you're kind of supposed to do it like that's if you if you want to if that really does speak to you and you know um i've talked to you about this before but muscle cars specifically once from the 1960s and the early 70s they speak to me in some weird way man i could just stare at them like i have a 65 corvette i walk around it sometimes at night when no one's around what's your favorite muscle car like what's your most badass late 60s the probably that car probably that 65 corvette yeah i walk around it when no one's around i think i've during the 69 corvette is there a particular year that uh just 65 is uh generation two 69 is generation three 69 is like the it's even more curvy they're both awesome just awesome in different ways but i just love muscle cars for whatever reason but but the point is like i like what i like and if i can do what i want to do i should do what i want to do and it's not hurting anybody and the thing is like i would do the duncan podcast if no one was listening right right if it was if we were just starting to do a podcast together and uh no one cared and it got like 2 000 views which we did for years a long time i would do it with duncan and we would get high and we'd talk crazy [ __ ] about aliens and spaceships and maybe dude maybe ideas are living life forms and they're inside your head and that's how things get man yeah man i've just kind of morphed me and him together in that because the life form ideal life form idea is mine that i've i've really really think about a lot i think about a technical side by the way like uh i when i heard you say that because i've been thinking i was like oh whoa that's interesting that it might be they might be alive because they i don't know what the [ __ ] they are but when someone has an idea for uh you know whatever an invention a toaster and then they think about this all it need is like these heating elements and a spring and then it pops on the stunts i have a timer and then they build this thing now also it's alive it's like you manifested it in a physical form a toaster is not the best example but a car a airplane you're thinking about a thing like an idea comes into your head and you can say oh well it's just creativity it's a part of being a person that's how we invented tools and how you know we became better hunters all those things are true it's i'm not saying that there's some magic to what i'm saying but there's also a possibility that we're simplifying something by saying that it's just creativity that it's just a natural human inclination to invent things but why is it possible that ideas like creativity like we are the only animal other than there's a few species that create things like bees make bee hives and but it's very they're very uniform you know some animals use tools you know like you know chimps will use like sticks to get termites and things like that but there's something about what we do that's it makes you wonder because we look at this just look at this room that we're in look at all these electronics look at all this crazy [ __ ] that human beings have invented and then built upon others inventions improved and innovated these all came out of ideas like the the idea they it germinates in someone's head it bounces around they write it down they share it with others the other people who have similar ideas or ideas that are complementary they work together and they they change the world and the new thing in that is the idea is not the people it's like we think we found the ideas but it's more like the ideas the ideas found us fine you yeah they're literally in the in the air yeah they come to you i always felt like that with bits like when i come up with a bit that's why i'm i'm always telling people about the stephen pressfield book the war of art because he talks about uh respecting the muse and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down and you do the work or you sit down like a professional and you you talk to the muse like come tell me what to do like if the muse was a real thing as if it amuses like a some mystical creature that comes and delivers you ideas even if that's not real that's how it works yeah it does work like that if you do treat it like it's a muse and you treat it with the respect and you you treat it like a professional the ideas do come to you i never thought about what he's doing he's just sitting there waiting for the idea that's trying to breed to find him yeah there's that's a that's a trippy thing if you show off trippy if you show up and put in the time and focus your energy on that the the ideas they will arrive that will arrive and that's the same with writing comedy like there's been many many times where i'll come home from the comedy store and i just sit down and start writing and i just i've i got nothing there's nothing there i'm just writing it's all [ __ ] nothing's good it's just like hmm and then all of a sudden bam there's the idea melson i can't stop and then you know a couple hours later and i'm like whoa and then the next night i'm on stage and i'm like how about that boom it gets this big laugh i'm like holy [ __ ] and i know that came out of the discipline to sit down and call the muse i mean the cool thing is the ideas have found you to like oh i'm going to use this dude like he seems to have a podcast that's popular yeah i'm going to breed inside his brain yeah and spread it to others yeah an or an inventor you know i'm going to use this guy who's like desperately seeking some sort of a a product to bring to market some guy who wants to invent things he's thinking about inventing things all the time like these ideas that weasel their way into your head and it seems to me also that your your the frequency that your mind operates under has to be correct because one of the things about creativity seems to be if you think about yourself a lot if you're really into yourself or your image or or you're selfish those ideas are not they don't find you yes that's funny the creative yeah yes it stifles the opportunity that the idea has for defining yes which is one of the reasons why joke thieves people that steal jokes are terrible writers there's never like really good writers who are also joke thieves it's just joke thieves and then you know when they have to write on their own if they get exposed they become terrible comedians they're of a shadow of what they were when they were stealing other people's ideas because the thing that would make you steal a person's idea is that ego part the the like the wanting to claim it for yourself to wanting to be the man i'm gonna or the woman you know you want to be the person who gets out there that says it and everybody's gonna love me for it like you can't think like that and be creative it requires a humility and it requires a detachment from self in order to create like when i'm writing i'm blank i'm like i'm just staring i'm like i'm just the part of my mind that's active is not like me it's like this weird core function part where i'm not i'm not aware of my personality i'm not aware i'm not aware of anything i'm just trying to put it together in a way that i know works and just being there being present yeah pressfield is just i'm a big believer just sitting there you're not staring at a blank page putting in the time yeah and sometimes it's not that way sometimes it's an inspiration like sometimes i'll be sitting there at dinner and i'll be like i'll be right i got an idea and my wife is really cool about that i'm like i have an idea and i i have to just run out of the room real quick and i write it down on my phone and then i can come back you know because those are those are like little gifts that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere and some people rely only on those gifts you know and i've talked to comics about it like i can't come on my best ideas when i don't write i'm like no i do too i come up with great ideas when i don't write but i also write like you can do both of those things they're not mutually exclusive you mentioned [ __ ] you money i i feel like i have [ __ ] you money now a year ago i was at zero i have [ __ ] you money now because probably my standards my i i don't need much in this world but because also probably because of you uh but it's 300 to 400 000 people listen to every episode i do and a lot and that result is weird it's a successful television show on cable yeah it's crazy but it's all you it's yeah it's hilarious that's amazing but at this point that also resulted in fu money in a sense that i don't um you know i don't need anything else in this world but so by way of asking i've looked up if you've inspired me for a long time do you have advice you've done this on the podcast side of life do you have advice for somebody like for me and somebody like me going on this journey eric weinstein is going on this journey is there advice both small and big that you have for somebody like me the advice is to keep doing what feels right to you and do what you're doing obviously it's resonating with people if you're getting that big of an audience and i've listened to your podcast you're very good at it so just keep doing it the way you're doing it um don't let anybody else get involved what about you've connected i think you met jamie at the comedy store i met him at the ice house at the ice house well i think i met him at the comedy store but then uh we talked at the ice house i mean what you'd have to ask him yeah did you think deeply about because like you know you basically have nobody on your team and and so it almost feels like a marriage where is it were you selective about like a jam to somebody to bring into your little circle well jamie's exceptional he is he truly he's a special i mean he might have grown i don't remember how he was in the early days maybe you could say but he's definitely better at it but he right away he's exceptional he's got very little ego yes he's he's not a guy who needs a lot of attention he's not a guy who um overestimates uh anything like in terms of like a negative or positive like his uh like his his interpretation of whether it's uh good things that happen to the show or bad things that happen the show he just takes it all like flat he's chill he's just cool as [ __ ] and he's so smart and he's so good as an audio engineer and as a podcast producer he's the best but he's basically one of the only people on you on this whole team so yeah how do you find i mean when you let people in i mean i'm sure other people wanted to get involved like why don't you have a co-host like you basically kind of well do you well here's the problem with the co-host like when you and i are talking when we're talking i'm tuned in to you and i'm waiting to hear what you're saying and i'm listening and i'm interpreting it and then i'm calculating whether or not i have anything to say whether to let you keep talking whether i maybe have a question that lets you expand further or whether i have a disagreement or like there's a dance that's going on now when there's another person there chiming in too it [ __ ] the dance up it's like dancing like if you're doing an uh a dance with someone you know like if you're slow dancing with someone and then a third person's there stepping on your feet sometimes it's fun yeah sometimes having a third person is fun comedy podcast sometimes it's fun um kind of structured yeah debate structures but even then it gets difficult because people talk over each other and also um i find that without headphones it's way easier to talk over each other you make mistakes yeah you don't you don't hear it the same way when you have headphones you i hear what you hear it's all one sound and i the audience hears exactly or rather i hear exactly what the audience hears whether it's over here my voice is louder than yours because you're over there and if i don't have headphones on it doesn't it's not all together on that point one of the interesting things about your show is uh you don't almost never have done and you just generally don't do remote like um sorry not remote calls but you don't go to another person's location like you have only done a few a small handful and then just like uh will the sapolsky he should be yeah he should do this but actually we went back and forth on email i told him he needs to get your his ass back in in this in the studio uh he's working on a book i was a fan of his a long time ago because i became obsessed with toxoplasmosis you know and uh i uh i've reached out to him a long time ago before he uh was willing to do it but then i caught him in downtown l.a he was there for something else and i just greedily snatched up an hour of his time well he doesn't get i think some of those folks don't get how much magic can happen in this podcast studio like bigger than anything they've ever done in terms of their work not i'm not talking about reach but in terms of the discovery of new ideas there's something magical about conversation like that like somebody as brilliant as him if he gives himself over to the conversation for multiple hours at a time that's another place where you've been an inspiration where i like you know i'm getting more and more confident of telling people like an elon musk that like you know a lot of ceos are like well he has 30 minutes on his schedule i'm like no three hours [Laughter] and then they're like so some say no and then they come back these people have started coming back to like okay we're starting to get it they start to get it and you're a rare beacon of hope in that sense that there's some value in long form they think that nobody wants to listen for 30 for more than 30 minutes they think like i have nothing to say but the reality is if you just give yourself over to like the three hours just let it go three hours four hours whatever it is there's so much to discover about what you didn't even know you think yeah yeah you have to be confident that you could do it and uh in the beginning i just did it because that's what i wanted to do and no one was listening so i've always been a curious person so i've always i've always been interested in listening to how people think about things and how and talking to people about their mindset and just and expanding on my own ideas and just talking [ __ ] and so we would have these podcasts and they would go on forever and my my friend ari i've i never let him die and never let this die down i've let him uh forget this he was always like you have to edit your podcast i'm telling you right now you're [ __ ] up i go why he's like because people are not going to listen to it i go they don't have to yeah i go you listen to part of it he goes he goes just do it just i'm telling you trust me cut it down to like 45 minutes that's all you need and i'm like no no i don't think you're right i i like listening to long-form things no one knows that kind of time i go okay i'm going to do it i'm just going to keep doing it this way so and it it sticks too good no he doesn't listen to his these are like two and a half hours long now you won but you wouldn't like say i mentioned to you this before this is gonna happen it's actually made a lot of progress toys i'm gonna talk to putin but you wouldn't travel to putin if you want to talk to you putin is a dangerous character he's not he's not you're talking to ever seen the thing with uh jerry craft where they stole his super bowl ring yeah yeah that was i think that was a little bit of a misunderstanding oh really i think it's a little bit he just decided he's going to steal that super bowl ring kind of i think that was a kind of he thought can i see your ring he shows him his ring then he puts it on says i can murder somebody with this ring so he and then he walks off with it it's possibly he did it uh as a he's a big believer in displays of power yeah so like it's possible he did that but on i think he sees himself as like a tool with which to demonstrate that russia still belongs on the stage of the big players and so he a lot of action is selected through that lens but in terms of a human being outside of any of the evils that uh he may or may not have done he is a really thoughtful intelligent fun human being like the wit uh and the depth from the jre perspective is really interesting i'm like his manager now selling the he's a judo trying to get trump he's really good at judo i i have seen him practice judo he's he's a legit black belt and not only that he loves it not just skill wise but to talk about it to reason about it to think about it to mma as well so yeah maybe it'd be a good conversation but you wouldn't travel to him well this holds your principle so that's the core of the advice or whatever i would rather here's the thing there's not a person that i have to have on the show right and i'm happy to talk to anybody i'm just as happy to talk to you as i am to talk to trump as i am probably more happy to talk to you as i am to talk to mike tyson as i am to talk to joey diaz i like talking to people i enjoy doing podcasts i enjoy talking to a variety of people and i schedule them based on i want to like i try not to get too many right-wing people in a row or too many progressive people in a row i don't want to get repetitive i try not get too many fighters in a row i try to balance it out not too many comedians comedians are the one one group where i can have three four in a row five in a row because that's my tribe you know those are my people it's easy we could talk about anything it's a weird dance you know the conversations that you're doing on a podcast are there they're a strange dance and you want to you know you want to not step on your own feet and you want to make sure that you do it in a way do the podcast in a way that's entertaining for people and it's it's the conversations are learning how to talk to me it's a weird skill yeah it's a weird skill that took a long time for me to get good at and i didn't know it was a skill until i started doing it and then i i just thought you were just talking like i was just i know how to talk we'll just talk to people and then along the way i realized like oh and then when you talk to people that are bad at it you realize that it's a skill like particularly one of the things about my people about comedians is a lot of them tend to want to talk but don't want to listen right so they're waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk but they're not necessarily thinking about what you're saying you know and they're just just waiting for their opportunity or they talk over you or they and i try real hard not to do that sometimes i fail but my when i'm at my best i'm i'm dancing yeah ultimately the skill conversation is just really listening mm-hmm like really and listening and thinking listening and thinking and being like genuinely curious and and really having um you know a take on what they're saying and and uh and maybe a follow-up question or maybe you know just got it's got to be real it's got to be authentic and when it is authentic and it's real it resonates with people like they're listening and they go oh like i'm locked in with the way you're thinking like you two guys are in a conversation and i'm locked in you know when she talks and you listen i i'm listening to you know when he says something to her when she says something to to him like there's a thing that happens during conversations where you're there like you're listening to and it's with me when i listen to a good podcast i feel like i'm in the room i feel like i'm in the room and i'm like like i'm like the friend that got to sit down and listen like oh yeah it's a great conversation yeah you know i love conversations so i love listening to them and i love putting them together and the fact that this podcast has gotten so [ __ ] big it it's stunning to me it blows me away i never anticipated it never thought for a second that that stupid thing that i used to do in my couch in my my office was the biggest thing i've ever done in my life by far like people used to make fun of it like there's a comedy store documentary that's coming out and one of the parts of the documentary is my friend tom segura when he first started doing my podcast he would he would be leaving and he would talk to red band he's like what the [ __ ] is he doing yeah like why is he doing this like who's listening he's like oh some people like it yeah and it's like [ __ ] nonsense waste of time and like in the the documentary it shows like 2 000 views like one of the early ustream episodes hilarious and they don't just like it really they uh they form a friendship with you it's like uh even me when people come up to me like the love in their eyes is kind of beautiful it's weird right yeah it's like you're part of their life yeah and it i don't know it's it's also heartbreaking because you realize you'll never really get to know them back like because they they clearly are friends with you yes yeah and it's sad to see a person who's clearly brilliant and interesting and is friends with you but you don't get a chance to return that love and uh i mean my kids it took them a while to figure out what's going on but uh people come up to me and uh you know they would say something like hey man i [ __ ] love you thanks man all right hey brother nice to meet you my daughter was like sick she's like do you know him yeah i'm like no i don't know him she's like how does he know you think this is a very weird conversation i used to have with young kids when i'd explained i do this thing called the podcast and millions of people listen so now one of my daughters is 12 and one of her friends is 13 and he's a boy and he goes to school with her and he's obsessed with me and so she's weirded out and she says to him i don't think you like me i think you're just into my dad [ __ ] weirdo she's gonna have that conversation in a few stages in her life oh that hard conversation with a boyfriend yeah probably yeah that well that's the thing about men too this this podcast um is uh my podcast is uniquely masculine i'm a man and i'm i'm not i i'm also a man that doesn't have to go through some sort of a corporate filter i'm not going through executive producers who tell me don't don't have this guest on don't talk about that you know that we looked at focus groups and they don't they don't seem to like when you do this like there's none of that i just and i i i just do it so if that's so i have a whole podcast where i just talk about cars and people like i don't want to hear you talk about cars well good congratulations you found what you like here's good news there's 1500 other ones go listen to the other episodes where i don't talk about cars you know you don't have to listen and it's not like your brand you just no are who you are and that's what you do but it's like it's authentically what i'm interested in all the podcasts whether i'm talking to david fravor about his experience with ufos whether i'm talking to david sinclair about life extension whether i'm talking to you about artificial intelligence or what it's because i want to talk to these people and that that resonates i i like when people are into [ __ ] you know i've talked about this before like things that i have no interest in making furniture but i like this pbs show where this guy makes furniture by hand yeah i love watching it craftsman because he's so into it yeah he's examining this and polishing that i'm not gonna do that i don't give a [ __ ] about furniture furniture for me is function like this desk function it works but i love when people are into it you know and i'm happy that someone can make it and they do a great job but i'm not i'm not interested in the the task is or the even the finished product as much as i'm interested in someone's passion for something the passion that they've put into this that shines through last question i sometimes ask this just for to uh what is it to challenge to make people roll their eyes to make legitimate scientists roll their eyes ask what is the meaning of life according to joe rogan i do not think there is a meaning i think there's many many meanings of life i think there's a way to navigate life that's enjoyable i think it requires many things it requires first of all requires love you have to have loved ones you have to have family you have to have friends you have to have people that care about you and you have to care about them i think that is primary then it also requires interests there has to be things that stimulate you now it could be just a subsistence lifestyle there's many people that believe and practice this uh lifestyle of just living off the land and hunting and fishing and living in the woods and they seem incredibly happy yeah and there's there's something to be said for that that is an interest right there's something and there's a there's a direct connection between their actions and their sustenance they get their food that way they're connected to nature and it's very satisfying for them if you don't have that uh i think you need something that is interesting to you something that's you're passionate about and there's far too many people that get sucked into living a life where you're just doing a job you're just showing up and putting in your time and then going home but you don't have a passion for what you're doing and i think that is that's the recipe for a boring and very unfulfilling life you mentioned love difficult backtrack what uh we talked about the demons and the violence in there somewhere what's the role of love in this in your own life it's very important man and that's one of the reasons why i'm so uh i'm so interested in helping people i'm very interested in people feeling good i like them to feel good i want to help them i like i like doing things that make them feel like oh you care about me like yeah i care about you i really do like i want people to feel good i want my family to feel good i want my friends to feel good i want guests to feel good about the podcast experience you know i i am i'm a big believer in as much as i can to spread positive energy and joy and happiness and and relay all the good advice that i've ever gotten all the things that i've learned and if they can benefit people and i find that those things benefit people and actually improve the quality of their life or improve their success or improve their relationships or i'm very happy to do that that means a lot to me the the way we interact with each other is so important it's one of the reasons why like if someone gets cancelled or you get publicly shamed it's so devastating because there's all these people that negative all this negative energy coming your way and you feel it as much as you like to pretend that you you're immune to that kind of stuff and some people do like to pretend that you feel it there's a there's a tangible force when people are upset at you and that's the same with loved ones or family or anytime someone's upset at you whether it's a giant group of people or there's a small amount of people that has an impact on you and your psyche and your physical being so the more you can spread love and the more love comes back to you you also create this butterfly effect right because where other people start recognizing like oh you know when he is nice to me i feel better and i'm going to be nicer to people and when i'm nicer to people they feel better and i feel better and and it spreads outward and that's one thing that i've done through this podcast i think is i've i've imparted my personal philosophy on in in kindness and generosity to other people yeah i mean to correct you you didn't do it the ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain have [ __ ] up the ideas that are all alive in the air made their way into my head love is a more efficient mechanism of spreading ideas they figured out yes probably man probably um so as far as like uh the meaning of life that's that's a bit without that you have nothing you know one of the big biggest failures in life is to be extremely successful financially but everybody hates you everybody hates you and you're just miserable and alone and angry and depressed and sad you know when you you hear about rich famous people that commit suicide like wow you missed the mark you got some parts right but you put too many eggs in one basket you put too many eggs in the financial basket or the success basket or the accomplishment basket and not enough in the friendship and love basket and there's a balance to that and what i talked about the violence and all that stuff like that to me is me understanding recognizing that is me trying to achieve that balance it's so like go kill those demons so that this boat is level you know because if it's not then the boat is like this and then everything's all [ __ ] up and every time we hit a wave things fall apart balance that boat out figure it out like know who you are some people don't have that problem at all some people they could just go for walks and they're cool as a cucumber i need more you know i need kettle bells i need a heavy bag i need uh i need the echo bike you know air assault bike i need some hardcore [ __ ] and if i don't get that i don't feel good so i figured that out too and that makes me a nicer person and that makes my interactions nicer it makes it it changes the quality of my my friendships and my relationships with people i think uh we mentioned eurolink i can i can certainly uh guarantee that this is one of the memories i'll be replaying 20
