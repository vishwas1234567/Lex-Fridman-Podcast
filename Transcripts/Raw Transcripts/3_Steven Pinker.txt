 you've studied the human mind cognition language vision evolution psychology from child to adult from the level of individual to the level of our entire civilization so I feel like I can start with a simple multiple-choice question what is the meaning of life is it a to attain knowledge as Plato said B to attain power as Nietzsche said C to escape death as Ernest Becker said d to propagate our genes as Darwin and others have said e there is no meaning as the nihilists have said F knowing the meaning of life is beyond our cognitive capabilities as Steven Pinker said based on my interpretation twenty years ago and G none of the above I'd say aid comes closest but I would amend that to attaining not only knowledge but fulfillment more generally that is life health stimulation access to the living cultural and social world now this is our meaning of life it's not the meaning of life if you were to ask our genes their meaning is to propagate copies of themselves but that is distinct from the meaning that the brain that they lead to sets for itself so to you knowledge is a small subset or a large subset it's a large subset but it's not the entirety of human striding because we also want to interact with people we want to experience beauty we want to experience the the richness of the natural world but understanding the what makes the universe tick is his way up there for some of us more than others certainly for me that's that's one of the top five so is that a fundamental aspect are you just describing your own preference or is this a fundamental aspect of human nature is to seek knowledge just in your latest book you talk about the the the power the usefulness of rationality and reason so on is that a fundamental nature human beings or is it something we should just strive for it's both it is we're capable of striving for it because it is one of the things that make us what we are Homo sapiens wise men we are unusual among animals in the degree to which we acquire knowledge and use it to survive we we make tools we strike agreements via language we extract poisons we predict the behavior of animals we try to get at the workings of plants and when I say we I don't just mean we in the modern West but we as a species everywhere which is how we've managed to occupy every niche on the planet and how we've managed to drive other animals to extinction and the refinement of Reason in pursuit of human well-being of health happiness social richness cultural richness is our our main challenge in the present that is using our intellect using our knowledge to figure out how the world works how we work in order to make discoveries and strike agreements that make us all better off in the long run right and you do that almost undeniably and in a data-driven way in a recent book but I'd like to focus on the artificial intelligence aspect of things and not just artificial intelligence but natural intelligence too so twenty years ago in the book you've written on how the mind works you conjecture again my right to interpret things you could you can correct me if I'm wrong but you conjecture that human thought in the brain may be a result of and now we're a massive network of highly interconnected neurons so from this interconnectivity emerges thought compared to artificial neural networks we use for machine learning today is there something fundamentally more complex mysterious even magical about the biological neural networks versus the ones we've been starting to use over the past 60 years and it becomes a success in the past 10 there is something a little bit mysterious about the human neural networks which is that each one of us who is a neural network knows that we ourselves are conscious conscious not of a sense of registering our surroundings or even registering our internal state but in having subjective first-person present-tense experience that is when I see red it's not just different from green but it just there's there's a redness to it I feel whether an artificial system would experience that or not I don't know and I don't think I can know that's why it's mysterious if we had a perfectly lifelike robot that was behaviorally indistinguishable from a human would we attribute consciousness to it or ought we to attribute consciousness to it and that's something that it's very hard to know but putting that aside put inside that that largely philosophical question the question is is there some difference between the human neural network and the ones that we were building in artificial intelligence will mean that we're on the current trajectory not going to reach the point where we've got a lifelike robot indistinguishable from a human because the way their neural so-called neural networks were organized are different from the way ours are organized having there's overlap but I think there are some some big differences that they're the current neural networks current so called deep learning systems are in reality not all that deep that is they are very good at extracting high order statistical regularities but most of the systems don't have a semantic level a level of actual understanding of who did what to who why where how things work what causes what else do you think that kind of thing can emerge as it does so artificial you know so much smaller the number of connections and so on in the current human biological networks but do you think sort of go to go to consciousness or to go to this higher level semantic reasoning about things do you think that can emerge with just a larger network with a more richly weirdly interconnected network separating consciousness because consciousness is even a matter of complex a really good one yeah you could have you could sensibly ask the question of whether shrimp are conscious for example they're not terribly complex but maybe they feel pain so let's just put that one that part of it aside yet but I think sheer size of a neural network is not enough to give it structure and knowledge but if it's suitably engineered then then why not that is where neural networks natural selection did a kind of equivalent of engineering of our brains so I don't know there's anything mysterious in the sense that no no system made out of silicon could ever do what a human brain can do I think it's possible in principle whether it'll ever happen depends not only on how clever we are in engineering these systems but whether even we even want to whether that's even a sensible goal that is you can ask the question is there any locomotion system that is as as good as a human well we kind of want to do better than a human ultimately in terms of legged locomotion there's no reason that humans should be our benchmark they're their tools that might be better in some ways it may just be not as maybe that we can't duplicate a natural system because at some point it's so much cheaper to use a natural system that we're not going to invest more brainpower and resources so for example we don't really have a subsidy and exact substitute for wood we still build houses out of would we still go furniture out of wood we like the look we like the feel it's wood has certain properties that synthetics don't there's not that there's any magical or mysterious about wood it's just that the extra steps of duplicating everything about wood is something we just haven't bothered because we have wood likewise a cotton I mean I'm wearing cotton clothing now feels much better than the polyester it's not that cotton has something magic in it and it's not that if there was that we couldn't ever synthesize something exactly like cotton but at some point it just it's just not worth it we've got cotton and likewise in the case of human intelligence the goal of making an artificial system that is exactly like the human brain is a goal that we no one's gonna pursue to the bitter end I suspect because if you want tools that do things better than humans you're not going to care whether it does something like humans so for example you're diagnosing cancer or particularly whether why set humans as your benchmark but in in general I suspect you also believe that even if the human should not be a benchmark on women's don't want to imitate humans in their system there's a lot to be learned about how to create an artificial intelligence system by studying the human yeah III think that's right there in in the same way that to build flying machines we want understand the laws of aerodynamics and including birds but not mimic the birds right but the same laws you have a view on AI artificial intelligence and safety that from my perspective is refreshingly rational or perhaps more importantly has elements of positivity to it which I think can be inspiring and empowering as opposed to paralyzing for many people including AI researchers the eventual existential threat of AI is obvious not only possible but obvious and for many others including a researchers the threat is not obvious so Elon Musk is is famously in the highly concerned about AI camp saying things like AI is far more dangerous and nuclear weapons and that AI will likely destroy human civilization so in February you said that if Elon was really serious about AI they the threat of AI he would stop building self-driving cars that he's doing very successfully as part of Tesla then he said Wow if even Pinker doesn't understand the difference between arrow AI like a car in general AI when the latter literally has a million times more compute power and an open-ended utility function humanity is in deep trouble so first what did you mean by the statement about Elon Musk should stop Bill ourselves driving cars if he's deeply concerned not last time that Elon Musk has fired off an intemperate tweet well we live in a world where Twitter has power yes yeah I think the the that there are two kinds of existential threat that have been discussed in connection with artificial intelligence and I think that they're both incoherent one of them is vague fear of AI takeover that it just as we subjugated animals and less technologically advanced people's so if we build something that's more advanced than us it will inevitably turn us into pets or slaves or or domesticated animal equivalents I think this confuses intelligence with a will to power that it so happens that in the intelligence system we are most familiar with namely Homo sapiens we are products of natural selection which is a competitive process and so bundled together with our problem-solving capacity are a number of nasty traits like dominance and exploitation and maximization of power and glory and resources and influence there's no reason to think that sheer problem-solving capability will set that as one of its goals its goals will be whatever we set it its goals as and as long as someone isn't building a megalomaniacal artificial intelligence and there's no reason to think that it would naturally evolve in that direction now you might say well what if we gave it the goal of maximizing its own power source well that's a pretty stupid goal to give a an autonomous system you don't give it that goal I mean that's just self-evident we idiotic so if you look at the history of the world there's been a lot of opportunities where engineers could instill in a system destructive power and they choose not to because that's the natural process of Engineering well weapons I mean if you're building a weapon its goal is to destroy people and so I think they're good reasons to not not build certain kinds of weapons I think the building nuclear weapons was a massive mistake but probably do you think so maybe pause on that because that is one of the serious threats do you think that it was a mistake in a sense that it was should have been stopped early on or do you think it's just an unfortunate event of invention that this was invented we think it's possible to stop I guess is the question it's hard to rewind the clock because of course it was invented in the context of World War two and the fear that the Nazis might develop one first then once was initiated for that reason it was it it was hard to turn off especially since winning the war against the Japanese and the Nazis was such an overwhelming goal of every responsible person that there's just nothing that people wouldn't have done then to ensure victory it's quite possible if World War two hadn't happened that nuclear weapons wouldn't have been invented we can't know but I don't think it was by any means a necessity any more than some of the other weapon systems that were envisioned but never implemented like planes that would disperse poison gas over cities like crop dusters or systems to try to do to create earthquakes and tsunamis in enemy countries to weaponize the weather weaponize solar flares all kinds of crazy schemes that that we thought the better off I think analogies between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence are fundamentally misguided because the whole point of nuclear weapons is to destroy things the point of artificial intelligence is not to destroy things so the analogy is is misleading so there's two artificial intelligence you mentioned the first one was the intelligence all know hungry yeah the system that we design ourselves where we give it the goals goals are external to the means to attain the goals I if we don't design an artificial intelligence system to maximize dominance then it won't maximize dominance it just that we're so familiar with Homo sapiens when these two traits come bundled together particularly in men that we are apt to confuse high intelligence with a will to power but that's just an error the other fear is that we'll be collateral damage that will give artificial intelligence a goal like make paperclips and it will pursue that goal so brilliantly that before we can stop it it turns us into paperclips we'll give it the goal of curing cancer and it will turn us into guinea pigs for lethal experiments or give it the goal of world peace and its conception of world pieces no people therefore no fighting and so it'll kill us all now I think these are utterly fanciful in fact I think they're actually self-defeating they first of all assume that we're going to be so brilliant that we can design an artificial intelligence that can cure cancer but so stupid that we don't specify what we mean by curing cancer in enough detail that it won't kill us in the process and it assumes that the system will be so smart that it can cure cancer but so idiotic that it doesn't can't figure out that what we mean by curing cancer is not killing everyone so I think that the the collateral damage scenario the value alignment problem is is also based on a misconception so one of the challenges of course we don't know how to build either system currently or are we even close to knowing of course those things can change overnight but at this time theorizing about it is very challenging in either direction so that that's probably at the core the problem is without that ability to reason about the real engineering things here at hand is your imagination runs away with things exactly but let me sort of ask what do you think was the motivation the thought process of elam Wasco i build autonomous vehicles I study autonomous vehicles I studied Tesla autopilot I think it is one of the greatest currently application large scale application of artificial intelligence in the world it has a potentially a very positive impact on society so how does a person who's creating this very good quote/unquote narrow AI system also seem to be so concerned about this other general AI what do you think is the motivation there what do you think is the thing really you probably have to ask him but there and and he is notoriously flamboyant impulsive to the as we have just seen to the detriment of his own goals of the health of a company so I don't know what's going on on his mind you probably have to ask him but I don't think the and I don't think the distinction between special-purpose a and so-called general is relevant that in the same way that special-purpose AI is not going to do anything conceivable in order to attain a goal all engineering systems have to are designed to trade off across multiple goals well we build cars in the first place we didn't forget to install brakes because the goal of a car is to go fast it occurred to people yes you want to go fast but not always so you build an brakes too likewise if a car is going to be autonomous that doesn't and program it to take the shortest route to the airport it's not going to take the diagonal and mow down people and trees and fences because that's the shortest route that's not what we mean by the shortest route when we program it and that's just what and an intelligent system is by definition it takes into account multiple constraints the same is true in fact even more true of so-called general intelligence that is if it's genuinely intelligent it's not going to pursue some goal single-mindedly omitting every other consideration and collateral effect that's not artificial in general intelligence that's that's artificial stupidity I agree with you by the way on the promise of autonomous vehicles for improving human welfare I think it's spectacular and I'm surprised at how little press coverage notes that in the United States alone something like 40,000 people die every year on the highways vastly more than are killed by terrorists and we spend we spent a trillion dollars on a war to combat deaths by terrorism but half a dozen a year whereas if you're an year out 40,000 people are massacred on the highways which could be brought down to very close to zero so I'm with you on the humanitarian benefit let me just mention that it's as a person who's building these cars it is it a little bit offensive to me to say that engineers would be clueless enough not to engineer safety into systems I often stay up at night thinking about those 40,000 people that are dying and everything I tried to engineer is to save those people's lives so every new invention that I'm super excited about every new and the in all the deep learning literature and cvpr conferences and nips everything I'm super excited about is all grounded in making it safe and help people so I just don't see how that trajectory can all a sudden slip into a situation where intelligence will be highly negative you know you and I certainly agree on that and I think that's only the beginning of the potential humanitarian benefits of artificial intelligence there's been enormous attention to what are we going to do with the people whose jobs are made obsolete by artificial intelligence but very little attention given to the fact that the jobs that hooni made obsolete are horrible jobs the fact that people aren't going to be picking crops and making beds and driving trucks and mining coal these are you know soul deadening jobs and we have a whole literature sympathizing with the people stuck in these menial mind deadening dangerous jobs if we can eliminate them this is a fantastic boon to humanity now granted we you solve one problem and there's another one namely how do we get these people a a decent income but if we're smart enough to invent machines that can make beds and put away dishes and and handle hospital patients well I think we're smart enough to figure out how to redistribute income to apportion some of the vast economic savings to the human beings who will no longer be needed to to make beds okay Sam Harris says that it's obvious that eventually AI will be in existential risk he's one of the people says it's obvious we don't know when the claim goes but eventually it's obvious and because we don't know when we should worry about it now this is a very interesting argument in my eyes so how do you how do we think about time scale how do we think about existential threats when we don't really know so little about the threat unlike nuclear weapons perhaps about this particular threat that it could happen tomorrow right so but very likely won't yeah they're likely to be a hundred years away so how do do we ignore it do how do we talk about it do we worry about it what how do we think about those what is it a threat that we can imagine it's within the limits of our imagination but not within our limits of understanding - sufficient to accurately predict it but but what what is what is the ether asre AI xai being the existential threat AI can always know like enslaving us or turning us into paperclips I think the most compelling from the Sam Harris was fact it would be the paperclip situation yeah I mean I just think it's totally fanciful I just don't build a system don't give it a don't first of all the code of engineering is you don't implement a system with massive control before testing it now perhaps the culture of engineering will radically change then I would worry I don't see any signs that engineers will suddenly do idiotic things like put a electrical power plant in control of a system that they haven't tested first or all of these scenarios not only imagine a almost a magically powered intelligence you know including things like cure cancer which is probably an incoherent goal because there's so many different kinds of cancer or bring about world peace I mean how do you even specify that as a goal but the scenarios also imagine some degree of control of every molecule in the universe which not only is itself unlikely but we would not start to connect these systems to infrastructure without without testing as we would any kind of engineering system now maybe some engineers will be irresponsible and we need legal and regulatory and legal responsibilities implemented so that engineers don't do things that are stupid by their own standards but the ii-i've never seen enough of a plausible scenario of existential threat to devote large amounts of brain power to to forestall it so you believe in the sort of the power and mass of the engineering of reason as the argue this book of Reason science and sort of be the very thing that puts the development of new technology so it's safe and also keeps us safe it's the same and you know granted the same culture of safety that currently is part of the engineering mindset for airplanes for example so yeah I don't think that that that should be thrown out the window and that untested all-powerful system should be suddenly implemented but there's no reason to think they are and in fact if you look at the progress of artificial intelligence it's been you know it's been impressive especially in the last ten years or so but the idea that suddenly there'll be a step function that all of a sudden before we know it it will be all powerful that there'll be some kind of recursive self-improvement some kind of Foom is also fanciful we certainly by the technology that we that were now impresses us such as deep learning when you train something on hundreds of thousands or millions of examples they're not hundreds of thousands of problems of which curing cancer is a typical example and so the kind of techniques that have allowed AI to increase in the last five years are not the claim that are going to lead to this fantasy of of exponential sudden self-improvement so it's may I think it's it's kind of a magical thinking it's not based on our understanding of how AI actually works now give me a chance here so you said fanciful magical thinking in his TED talk Sam Harris says that thinking about AI killing all human civilization is somehow fun intellectually now I have to say as a scientist engineer I don't find it fun but when I'm having beer with my non-ai friends there is indeed something fun and appealing about it like talking about an episode of black mirror considering if a large meteor is headed towards Earth we were just told a large meteors headed towards Earth something like this and can you relate to this sense of fun and do you understand the psychology of it yeah that's a good question III personally don't find it fun I find it kind of actually a waste of time because there are genuine threats that we ought to be thinking about like like pandemics like like a cyber security vulnerabilities like the possibility of nuclear war and certainly climate change this is enough to film it many conversations without and I think there I think Sam did put his finger on something namely that there is a community us sometimes called the rationality community that delights in using its brain power to come up with scenarios that would not occur to mere mortals to less cerebral people so there is a kind of intellectual thrill in finding new things to worry about that no one has worried about yet I actually think though that it's not only is it is a kind of fun that doesn't give me particular pleasure but I think there is there can be a pernicious side to it namely that you overcome people with such dread such fatalism that there's so many ways to die to annihilate our civilization that we may as well enjoy life while we can there's nothing we can do about it if climate change doesn't do us in then runaway robots will so let's enjoy ourselves now we've got to prioritize we have to look at threats that are close to certainty such as climate change and distinguish those from ones that are merely imaginable but with infinitesimal probabilities and we have to take into account people's worry budget you can't worry about everything and if you so dread and fear and terror and numb and fatalism it can lead to a kind of numbness well they're just these problems are overwhelming and the engineers are just gonna kill us all so let's either destroy the entire infrastructure of science technology or let's just enjoy life while we can so there's a certain line of worry which I'm worried about a lot of things engineering there's a certain line of worry when you cross a lot across that it becomes paralyzing fear as opposed to productive fear and that's kind of what they're highlighting there exactly right and we've seen some we know that human effort is not well calibrated against risk in that because a basic tenet of cognitive psychology is that perception of risk and hence perception of fear is driven by imagined ability not by data and so we miss allocate vast amounts of resources to avoiding terrorism which kills on average about six Americans a year with a one exception of 9/11 we invade countries we invent entire new departments of government with massive massive expenditure of resources and lives to defend ourselves against a trivial risk whereas guaranteed risks and you mentioned as one of them you mentioned traffic fatalities and even risks that are not here but are plausible enough to worry about like pandemics like nuclear war receive far too little attention the in presidential debates there's no discussion of how to minimize the risk of nuclear war lots of discussion of terrorism for example and and so we I think it's essential to calibrate our budget of fear worry concern planning to the actual probability of harm yep so let me ask this then this question so speaking of imagined ability you said it's important to think about reason and one of my favorite people who who likes to dip into the outskirts of reason through fascinating exploration of his imagination is Joe Rogan oh yes you so who has through reason used to believe a lot of conspiracies and through a reason has stripped away a lot of his beliefs in that way so it's fascinating actually to watch him through rationality kind of throw away that ideas of Bigfoot and 9/11 I'm not sure exactly trails I don't know what the leaves in yet but you no longer know believed in that's right no either he's become a real force for for good yeah so you were on the Joe Rogan podcast in February and had a fascinating conversation but as far as I remember didn't talk much about artificial intelligence I will be on his podcast in a couple weeks Joe is very much concerned about existential threat away I am not sure if you're this is why I was I was hoping that you would get into that topic and in this way he represents quite a lot of people who look at the topic of AI from 10,000 foot level so as an exercise of communication he said it's important to be rational and reason about these things let me ask if you were to coach me as AI researcher about how to speak to Joe and the general public about AI what would you advise well I'd the short answer would be to read the sections that I wrote an Enlightenment I know about AI but a longer reason would be I think to emphasize and I think you're very well positioned as an engineer to remind people about the culture of engineering that it really is safety oriented that another discussion in enlightenment now I plot rates an accidental death from various causes plane crashes car crashes Occupational accidents even death by lightning strikes and they all plummet because the culture of engineering is how do you squeeze out the the lethal risks death by fire death by drowning death by asphyxiation all of them drastically declined because of advances in engineering then I gotta say I did not appreciate until I saw those graphs and it is because exactly people like you who stamp at night thing oh my god it is what a mime is what I mean what I'm inventing likely to hurt people and to deploy ingenuity to prevent that from happening now I'm not an engineer although I spent 22 years at MIT so I know something about the culture of engineering my understanding is that this is the way this is what you think if you're an engineer and it's essential that that culture not be suddenly switched off when come start official intelligence so I mean fact that could be a problem but is there any reason to think it would be switched off I don't think so and one there's not enough engineers speaking up for this way for this the excitement for the positive view of human nature what you're trying to create is the positivity like everything we try to invent is trying to do good for the world but let me ask you about the psychology of negativity it seems just objectively not considering the topic it seems that being negative about the future makes you sound smarter than me positive about the future irregardless of topic am I correct in the observation and if you if so why do you think that is yeah I think that I think there is that that phenomenon that as Tom Lehrer the satirist said always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet it may be part of our overall negativity bias we are as a species more attuned to their negative than the positive we dread losses more than we enjoy gains and that mate might open up a space for prophets to remind us of harms and risks and losses that we may have overlooked so I think there there there is that asymmetry so you've written some of my favorite books all over the place so starting from enlightenment now to the better angels of our nature blank slate how the mind works the the one about language language instinct bill gates big fan to set of your most recent book that it's my new favorite book of all time so for you as an author what was the book early on in your life that had a profound impact on the way you saw the world certainly this book enlightenment now is influenced by David Deutsch as the beginning of infinity a rather deep reflection on knowledge and the power of knowledge to improve the human condition the and with bits of wisdom such as that problems are inevitable but problems are solvable given the knowledge and that solutions create new problems have to be solved in their turn that's I think a kind of wisdom about the human condition that influenced the writing of this book there's some books that are excellent but obscure some of which I have on my page of my website I read a book called the history of force self-published by a political scientist named James Payne on the historical decline of violence and that was one of the inspirations for the better angels of our nature the what about early on if we look back when you're maybe a teenager loved a book called one two three infinity when I was a young adult I read that book by George gamma the physicist very accessible in humorous explanations of relativity of number theory of dimensionality high multiple dimensional spaces in a way that I think is still delightful seventy years after it was published I like that the time life science series these were books that would arrive every month my mother subscribed to each one on a different topic one would be on electricity what would be on forests want to be learned may evolution and then one was on the mind and I was just intrigued that there could be a science of mind and that that book I would cite as an influence as well then later on you fell in love with the idea of studying the mind that's one thing that grabbed you it was one of the things I would say the I read as a college student the book reflections on language by Noam Chomsky spent most of his career here at MIT Richard Dawkins two books the blind watchmaker and The Selfish Gene or enormous Li influential partly for mainly for the content but also for the writing style the ability to explain abstract concepts in lively prose Stephen Jay Gould first collection ever since Darwin also excellent example of lively writing George Miller psychologist that most psychologists are familiar with came up with the idea that human memory has a capacity of seven plus or minus two chunks and then Sophia's biggest claim to fame but he wrote a couple of books on language and communication that I've read it's an undergraduate again beautifully written and intellectually deep wonderful Steven thank you so much for taking the time today my pleasure thanks a lot Lex you
