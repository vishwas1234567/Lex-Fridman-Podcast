 the following is a conversation with Regina Bardsley she's a professor at MIT and a world-class researcher in natural language processing and applications of deep learning to chemistry and oncology or the use of deep learning for early diagnosis prevention and treatment of cancer she has also been recognized for teaching of several successful AI related courses at MIT including the popular introduction to machine learning course this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube give it five stars and iTunes supported on patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled Fri D ma a.m. and now here's my conversation with Regina Bosley in an interview you've mentioned that if there's one course you would take it would be a literature course for the friend of yours that a friend of your teachers just out of curiosity because I couldn't find anything on it are there books or ideas that had profound impact on your life journey books and ideas perhaps outside of computer science and the technical fields I think because I'm spending a lot of my time at MIT and previously in other institutions where I was a student I have limited ability to interact with people so a lot of what I know about the world actually comes from books and they were quite enough of books that had profound impact on me and how I view the world let me just give you one example of such a book I've maybe a year ago read a book called the emperor of all maladies it's a book about it's kind of a history of science book on how the treatments and drugs for cancer were developed and that book despite the fact that I am in the business of science really opened my eyes on how imprecise and imperfect the discovery process is and how imperfect our current solutions and what makes science succeed and be implemented and sometimes it's actually known the strengths of the idea but devotion of the person who wants to see it implemented so this is one of the books and you know at least for the last year quite changed the way I'm thinking about scientific process just from the historical perspective and what do I need to do to make my ideas really implemented let me give you an example of a book which is not kind of which is a fiction book is a book called Americana and this is a book about a young female student who comes from Africa to study in the United States and it describes her paths you know was in her studies and her life transformation that you know in a new country and kind of adaptation to a new culture and when I read this book I saw myself in many different points of it but but it also kind of gave me the lens on different events and some event that I never actually paid attention one the funny stories in this book is how she arrives to to her new college and she starts speaking in English and she had this beautiful British accent because that's how she was educated in her country and this is not my case and then she notices that the person who talks to her you don't talk to her in a very funny way in a very slow way and she's thinking that this woman is disabled in a and she's also trying to kind of talk um a date huh and then after a while when she finishes her discussion with this officer from her college she sees how she interacts with the other students with American students and he discovers that actually she talked to her this way because she saw that she doesn't understand English and I he said wow this is a fine experience and he literally within few weeks I went to to LA to a conference and they asked somebody in the airport you know how to find like a cab or something and then I noticed this person is talking in a very strange way and my first thought was and this person have some you know pronunciation issues or something and I'm trying to talk very slowly to him an average with another professor and Frankel and he's like laughing because it's funny that I don't get that the guy is talking it in this way because he think that I cannot speak so it was really kind of mirroring experience as it is let me think a lot about my own experiences moving you know from different countries so I think that books play a big role in my understanding of the world on the on the science question you mentioned that it made you discover that personalities of human beings are more important than perhaps ideas is that what I heard it's not necessarily that they are more important than ideas but I think that ideas on their own unknown sufficient and many times at least at the local horizon is the personalities and their devotion to their ideas is really the locally changes the landscape now if you're looking at AI like let's say 30 years ago you know Dark Ages of AI or whatever what the symbolic times you can use anyone you know there is some people now we're looking at a lot of that work and we're kind of thinking this is not really maybe a relevant work but you can see that some people manage to take it and to make it so shiny and dominate the you know the academic world and make it to be the standards if you look in the area of natural language processing it is well known fact and the reason the statistics in NLP took such a long time to became to become mainstream because there were quite a number of personalities which didn't believe in this idea and it stopped research progress in this area so I do not think that you know can asymptotically maybe personalities matters but I think locally it does make quite a bit of impact okay generally you know speed adds speed up the rate of adoption of the new ideas yeah and and the other interesting question is in the early days of particular discipline I think you mentioned in in that book was is ultimately a book of cancer it's called the Emperor of all maladies yeah the yep and those maladies included the trying to the medicine was the center arm so it was actually centered on you know how people sort of curing cancer like like for me it was really a disc how people what was the science of chemistry behind drug development that it actually grew up out of the dyeing like coloring industry that people who developed chemistry in 19th century in Germany and Britain - do you know the really new dyes they looked at the molecular and identified it they do certain things to cells and from there the process started and you know like histology thing yeah this is fascinating that they managed to make the connection and look under the microscope and do all this discovery but as you continue reading about it and you read about how chemotherapy drugs socially developed in Boston and some of them were developed and Farber dr. Farber from Dana Farber you know how the experiments were done that you know there was some miscalculation let's put it this way and they tried it on the patients and then just and those were children with leukemia and they died and they tried another modification you look at the process how imperfect is this process and you don't like it well again looking back like six years ago 70 years ago you can kind of understand it but some of the stories in this book which were really shocking to me we're really happening you know maybe decades ago and we still don't have a vehicle to do it much more fast and effective and you know scientific the way of taking computer science scientific so from the perspective of computer science you've gotten chance to work the application to cancer and to medicine in general from a perspective of an engineer and a computer scientist how far along are we from understanding the human body biology of being able to manipulate it in a way we can cure some of the melodies some of the diseases so this is very interesting question and if you're thinking is a computer scientist about this problem I think one of the reasons that we succeeded in the areas we as a computer scientist succeeded is because we don't have we are not trying to understand in some ways like if you're thinking about like e-commerce Amazon I was doesn't really understand you and that's why it recommends you certain books or certain products correct and in you know traditionally when people were thinking about marketing you know they divided the population to different kind of subgroups identify the features of this subgroup and come up with a strategy which is specific to that subgroup if you're looking about recommendation system they're not claiming they understanding somebody they're just managing to from the patterns of your behavior to recommend you a product now if you look at the traditional Biogen obviously I wouldn't say that I at any way you know educated in this field but you know what I see there is really a lot of emphasis on mechanistic understanding and it was very surprising to me coming from computer science how much emphasis is on this understanding and given the complexity of the system maybe the deterministic full understanding of this processes is you know beyond our capacity and the same ways in computer science when we doing recognition when you recommendation in many other areas it's just probabilistic matching process and in some way maybe in certain cases we shouldn't even attempt to understand we can attempt to understand but in parallel we can actually do this kind of matching that would help us to find you out to do early diagnostics and so on and I know that in these communities it's really important to understand but I am sometimes wondering what exactly does it mean to understand here well there's stuff that works and but that can be like you said separate from this deep human desire to uncover the mysteries of the universe of of science of the way the body works the way the mind works it's the dream of symbolic AI of being able to reduce human knowledge into into logic and be able to play with that logic in a way that's very explainable and understandable for us humans I mean that's a beautiful dream so I understand it but it seems that what seems to work today we'll talk about it more as as much as possible reduced stuff into Data reduce whatever problem you're interested in to data and try to apply statistical methods flat machine learning to that on a personal note you were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 what it facing your mortality make you think about how did they change you know this is a great question and I think that I was interviewed many times nobody actually asked me this question I think I was 43 at a time and if the first time I realized in my life that I may die and I never thought about it before and yeah and there was a long time since you diagnosed until you're sure you know what you have and have CV is your disease for me it was like maybe two and a half months and I didn't know where I am during this time because it was getting different tests and one would say it's bad and I would say no it is not so until I knew where I am I really was thinking about all these different possible outcomes were you imagining the worst or were you trying to be optimistic or it would be really I don't remember you know what was my thinking it was really a mixture with many components at the time at speaking you know in our terms and one thing that I remember and you know every test comes and you're saying oh it could be this so it may not be this and you're hopeful then you're disparate so it's like if there is a whole you know slow of emotions it goes through but what I remember is that when I came back to MIT I was kind of going the whole times to the treatment to MIT but was brain was not really there but when I came back here I finished went to each one that I was here teaching and everything yeah I look back at what my group was doing what other groups was doing and I saw these trivialities it's like people are building their careers on improving some parts around two or three percent or whatever I was like seriously I did a walk on how to decipher Ugaritic like a languages nobody speak and and whatever like what is significance when I was sad and you know I walked out of MIT which is you know when people really do care you know what happened to you I clear favor is you know what is your next publication to ACL to the world where people you know people you see a lot of sufferings that I'm kind of totally shouldered on it on daily basis and it's like the first time I've seen like real life and real suffering and I was thinking why are we trying to improve the parser or deal with some trivialities when we have capacity to really make a change and it was really challenging to me because on one hand you know I have my graduate students really want to do their papers and their work and they want to continue to do what they were doing which was great and then it was me who really kind of reevaluated what is the importance and also at that point because I had to take some break I look back into like my years in science and I was thinking you know like 10 years ago this was the biggest thing I don't know topic models that we have like millions of papers on topic models and variation topics models now it's really like irrelevant and you you start looking at this you know what do you perceive as important a different point of time and how you know it's fades over time and since we have a limited time all of us have limited time unless it's really important to prioritize things that really matter to you maybe matter to you at that particular point but is important to take some time and understand what matters to you which may not necessarily be the same as what matters to the rest of your scientific community and pursue that vision so though that moment did it make you cognizant you mentioned suffering of just the general amount of suffering in the world is that what you're referring to so as opposed to topic models and specific detail problems in NLP did did you start to think about other people who have been diagnosed with cancer that the way you saw the started to see the world perhaps oh absolutely and it actually creates because for instance you know these parts of the treatment where you need to go to the hospital every day and you see you know the community of people that you see and many of them are much worse then I I was at a time and you're over sad and see it all and people who are happy as some day just because they feel better and for people who are in our normal every aisle you take it totally for granted that you feel well that if you decide to go running you can go running and you can you know you're pretty much free to do whatever you want with your body like I saw like a community my community became those people and I remember one of my friends Dena kitabi took me to Prudential to buy me a gift for my birthday and it was like the first time in months I said I went to kind of to see other people and I was like wow first of all these people you know they're happy and they're laughing and they're very different from this other my people and second of singing I think it totally crazy they're like laughing and wasting their money on some stupid gifts and you know they may die they already may have cancer and and they don't understand it so you can really see how the mind changes that you can see that you know before that you can have didn't you know that you're gonna die of course I knew but it was kind of a theoretical notion it wasn't something which was concrete and at that point when you really see it and see how little means some time the system has to hummed and you really feel that we need to take a lot of our brilliance that we have here at MIT and translated into something useful yeah and you so couldn't have a lot of definitions but of course alleviating suffering alleviating trying to cure cancer is a beautiful mission so I of course know the theoretically the notion of cancer but just reading more and more about its 1.7 million new cancer cases in the United States every year 600,000 cancer related deaths every year so this has a huge impact United States global when broadly before we talk about how machine learning how MIT can help when do you think we as a civilization will cure cancer how hard of a problem is it from everything you've learned from it recently I cannot really assess it what I do believe will happen with the advancement in machine learning that a lot of types of cancer we will be able to predict way early and more effectively utilize existing treatments I think I hope at least that with all the advancements in AI and drug discovery we would be able to much faster find relevant molecules what I'm not sure about is how long it will take the medical establishment and regulatory bodies to kind of catch up and to implement it and they think this is a very big piece of puzzle that is currently not addressed the see really interesting question so first a small detail that I think the answer is yes but is cancer one of one of the diseases that when detected earlier that significantly improves the outcomes it's so like because we will talk about there's the cure and then there is detection and I think while machine learning can really help is earlier detection so the detection help prediction is crucial for instance the vast majority of pancreatic cancer patients are detected at the stage they are incurable that's why they have such a you know terrible survival rate it's like just few percent over five years it's pretty much today a death sentence but if you can discover this disease early there are mechanisms to treat it and in fact I know a number of people who were diagnosed and saved just because they had food poisoning they had terrible food poisoning they went to our and they got scan there were early science on the scan that would save their lives but this wasn't really an accidental case so as we become better we would be able to help too many more people that have you know that are likely to develop diseases and I just want to say that as I got more into this field I realize that you know countries of course terrible disease but they're really the whole slew of terrible diseases out there like neurodegenerative diseases and others so we of course a lot of us are fixated on cancer just because it's so prevalent in our society and you see these people and there are a lot of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and that kind of aging diseases that we still don't have a good solution for and we you know and I felt as a computer scientist we kind of decided that it's other people's job to treat these diseases because it's like traditionally people in biology or in chemistry or and these are the ones who's thinking about it and after kind of start paying attention I think that it's really a wrong assumption and we all need to join the bottle so how it seems like in cancer specifically that there's a lot of ways that machine learning can help so what's what's the role of machine learning in the diagnosis of cancer so for many cancers today we really don't know what is your likelihood to get cancer and for the vast majority of patients especially on the younger patients it really comes as a surprise like for instance for breast cancer 80% of the patients are first in their families it's like me and I never thought that I had any increased risk because you don't nobody had it in my family and for some reason in my head it was kind of inherited disease but even if I would pay attention the the models that currently this is very simplistic statistical models that are currently used that in clinical practice it really don't give you an answer so you don't know and the same pancreatic cancer the same truth for non-smoking one cancer and many others so what machine learning can do here is utilize all this data to tell us le who is like it'll be susceptible and using all the information that is already there beat imaging beat your other tests and you know eventually liquid biopsies and others where the signal itself is not sufficiently strong for human eye to do good discrimination because the signal may be weak but by combining many sources machine which is trained on large volumes of data can really detect it early and that what we've seen with breast cancer and people are reporting it in other diseases as well that really boils down to data right and in the different kinds of sources of data and you mentioned regulatory challenges so what are the challenges in gathering large data sets in the space again another great question so it took me after I decided that I want to work on it two years to get access to data and like right now in this country there is no publicly available data set of modern mammograms that you can just go on your computer sign a document and get it it just doesn't exist I mean in obviously every hospital has its own collection of mammograms there are data that come out if they came out of clinical trials what we're talking about here is a computer scientist who just want to run his or her model and see how it works this data like imagenet doesn't exist and they you know there is an e said which is called like florida data set which is a film mammogram from 90s which is totally not representative of the current developments whatever you're learning on them doesn't scale up this is the only resource that is available and today there are many agencies that govern access to data like the hospital holds your data and the hospital decides whether they would give it to the researcher to walk with this data individual hospital yeah I mean the hospital may you know assume is that you're doing a surgical operation you can submit you know there is appropriate prove all process guided by IRB and you if you go through all the processes you can eventually get access to the data but if you yourself know I community they don't know that many people culturally ever go to access to data because it's very challenging process and Sarge isn't a quick comment eat MGH or any kind of hospital are they scanning the data that they digitally storing it oh it is already digitally stored you don't need to do any extra processing steps it's already there in the right format is that all right now there are a lot of issues that govern access to the data because the hospital is legally responsible for for the data and you know they have a lot to lose if they give the data to the wrong person but they may not have a lot to gain if they gave it as a hospital as a legal entity as giving it to you and the way you know whatever dimension happening in the future is the same thing that happens when you're getting your driving license you can decide whether you want to donate your organs so you can imagine that whenever a person goes to the hospital they it should be easy for them to the name their data for research and it can be different kind of do they only give you your test results or only mammogram only imaging data or the whole medical record because at the end we all will benefit from all this insights and it's not like you say I want to keep my data private but I would really love to get it you know from other people because other people think in the same way so if there is a mechanism to do this the nation and and the patient has an ability to say how they want to use their data for research it would be really a game-changer people when they think about this problem there's a it depends on the population the pains and the demographics but there's some privacy concerns generally we're not just medical data just say any kind of data it's what you said my data it should belong kind of to me I'm worried how it's going to be misused how how do we alleviate those concerns is that seems like a problem that needs to be that problem of trust of transparency needs to be solved before we build large data sets that help detect cancer help save those very people and there in the future so similar to things that could be done there is a technical solutions and there are societal solutions so on the technical and we today have ability to improve disambiguation like for instance for imaging it's you know for imaging you can do it pretty well what's this ambiguous and it's removing the identification removing the names of the people there are other data like if it isn't Rotax you cannot really achieve 99.9 percent but there are all these techniques that I should some of them I developed at MIT how you can do learning on the encode the data where you locally encode the image you train on network which only works on the encoded on encoded images and then you send the outcome back to the hospital and you can open it up so those are the technical solution there are a lot of people who are walking in this space where the learning happens in the encoded form I we're still early but this is the interesting research area what I think will make more progress there is a lot of work in natural language processing community how to do the identification better but even today there already a lot of data which can be de-identified perfectly like your test data for instance correct where you can just you know the name of the patient you just want to extract the part with the numbers the big problem here is again hospitals don't see much incentive to give this data away on one hand and then it is general concern now when I'm talking about societal benefits and about the education the public needs to understand that I think that there are situation and I still remember myself when I really needed an answer I had to make a choice there was no information to make a choice you're just guessing and at that moment you feel that your life is at the stake but you just don't have information to make the choice and many times when I give talks I get emails from women who say you know I'm in this situation can you please run statistic and see what are the outcomes we get almost every week a mammogram that comes by me to my office at MIT I'm serious that people ask to run because they need to make you know life-changing decisions and of course you know I'm not planning to open a clinic here but we do run and give them the results for their doctors but the point that I'm trying to make that we all at some point or our loved ones will be in the situation where you need information to make the best choice and if this information is not available you would feel vulnerable and unprotected and then the question is you know what do I care more because at the end everything is a trainer of correct yeah exactly just out of curiosity what it seems like one possible solution I'd like to see what you think of it based on what you just said based on wanting to know answers for anyone urine yourself in that situation is it possible for patients to own their data as opposed to hospitals owning their data of course theoretically I guess patients own their data but can you walk out there with the USB stick containing everything or uploaded to the cloud we're a company you know I remember Microsoft had a service like I try I was be really excited about and Google health was there I tried to give and I was excited about it basically companies helping you upload your data to the cloud so that you can move from hospital to hospital from Doctor to doctor do you see a promise of that kind of possibility I absolutely think this is you know the right way to to exchange the data I don't know now who is the biggest player in this field but I can clearly see that even you know for even for totally selfish health reasons when you are going to a new facility and many of us ascend to some specialized treatment they don't easily have access to your data and today you know we wouldn't want to send this mammogram need to go to the hospital find some small office which give them that CD and they ship as the CDC you can imagine we're looking at the kind of decades-old mechanism of data exchange so I definitely think this is in the area where hopefully all the right regulatory and technical forces will align and we will see it actually implemented it's sad because unfortunately and I have I need to research why that happened but I'm pretty sure Google Health and Microsoft's HealthVault or whatever it's called both closed down which means that there was either regulatory pressure or there's not a business case or there's challenges from hospitals which is very disappointing so when you say you don't know what the biggest players are the two biggest that I was aware of close the doors so I'm hoping uh I'd love to see why and I'd love to see who else can come up it seems like one of those Elon Musk style problems that are obvious needs to be solved and somebody needs to step up and actually do this large-scale data collection I know that is an initiative in Massachusetts the thing that you led by the governor to try to create this kind of house exchange system or at least to help people who kind of when you show up in emergency room and there is no information about what our ologists and other things so I drove how far it will go but another thing is you said and I find it very interesting it's actually who are the successful players in this space and the whole implementation how does it go two meters from the anthropological perspective it's more fascinating that AI that today goes in healthcare you know we've seen so many you know attempts and so very little successes and it's interesting to understand that I've by no means you know have knowledge to assess why we are in the position where we are yeah it's interesting as a data is really fuel for a lot of successful applications and when that data requires regulatory approval like the FDA or any kind of approval it's seems that the computer scientists are not quite there yet in being able to play the regular game understanding the fundamentals of it I think that in many cases when even people do you have data we still don't know what exactly do you need to demonstrate to change the standard of care well like let me give you example related to my breast cancer research so traditional in traditional breast cancer risk assessment there is something called density which determines the likelihood of a woman to get cancer and this is pretty much this how much white do you see on the mammogram the white say it is and the more likely the tissue is dense and the idea behind density it's not a bad idea in 1967 a radiologist called wolf decided to look back at women who were diagnosed and see what is special in the images can we look back and says that they're likely to develop so he come up with some patters it was the best that his human I can you know can identify then it was kind of formalized and coded into four categories and that what we are using today and today this density assessment is actually a federal law from 2019 they're approved by President Trump and for the previous FDA Commissioner where women are supposed to be advised by their providers if they have high density putting them into high-risk category and in some states you can actually get supplementary screening paid by your insurance because you are in this category now you can say how much science do we have behind it whatever biological science or epidemiological evidence so it turns out that between 40 and 50 percent of women have dense breasts so about 40 percent of patients are coming out of their screening and somebody tells them you are in high risk now what exactly does it mean if you as half of the population high risk its recede maybe I'm not you know what do I really need to do with it because the system doesn't provide me a lot of the solutions because there are so many people like me we cannot really provide very expensive solutions for them and the reason this whole density became this big deal it's actually advocated by the patients who felt very unprotected because many women when did the mammograms which were normal and then it turns out that they already had cancer quite developed cancer so they didn't have a way to know who is really at risk and what is the likelihood it when the doctor tells you you're okay you are not okay well at the time and it was you know 15 years ago this maybe was the best piece of science that we had and it took you know quite 1516 years to make it federal law but now that this is this is a standard now within the planning model we can so much more accurately predict who is gonna develop breast cancer just because you're trained on a logical thing and instead of describing how much white and what kind of white machine can systematically identify the patterns which was the original idea behind the sort of the traditions machinists can do it much more systematically and predict the risk when you train the machine to look at the image and to say the risk in one to five years now you can ask me how long it will take to substitute this density which is broadly used across the country and I really it's not helping to bring this new models and I would say it's not a matter of the algorithm algorithm is already orders of magnitude better the thought is currently in practice I think it's really the question who do you need to convince how many hospitals do you need to run the experiment both you know all this mechanism of adoption and how do you explain to patients and to women across the country that this is really a better measure and again I don't think it's in AI question we can walk more and make the algorithm even better but I don't think that this is the current you know the barrier the barrier is really this other piece that for some reason is not really explored it's like anthropological trees and coming back to a question about books there is a book that I am reading it's called American sickness by Elizabeth was in town and I got this book from my clinical collaborator dr. Connie Limon and I said I know everything that I need to know about American health system but you know every page doesn't fail to surprise me and I think there is a lot of interesting and really deep lessons for people like us from computer science who are coming into this field to really understand how complex is the system of incentives in the system to understand how you really need to play to drive adoption you just said it's complex but if we're trying to simplify it who do you think most likely would be successful if we push on this group of people is that the doctors is it the hospitals is it the governments of policymakers is it the individual patients consumers who needs to be inspired to most likely lead to adoption or is there no simple answer there's no simple answer but I think there is a lot of good people in medical system who do want you know to make a change and I think a lot of power will come from us as a consumers because we all are consumers or future consumers of healthcare services and I think we can do so much more in explaining the potential and not in the hype terms and not saying that we now killed all antimatter and you know I'm really sick of reading this kind of articles which made these claims but really to show with some examples what this implementation does and how it changes the care because I can't imagine doesn't matter what kind of politician it is you know we all are susceptible to these diseases there is no one who is free and eventually you know we all are humans and we're looking for way to alleviate the suffering and and this is one possible way where we can't the underutilizing which i think can help so it sounds like the biggest problems are outside of AI in terms of the biggest impact at this point but are there any open problems in the application of ml to oncology in general so improving the detection or any other creative methods whether it's on the detection segmentations of the vision perception side or some other clever of inference yeah what would it in general in youth any of you are the open problems in this space yeah I just want to mention sit beside detection another area what I am kind of quite active and I think it's really an increasingly important area in house care is drug design because you know it's fine if you detect something early but you still need to get you know to get drugs and new drugs for these conditions and today all of the drug design ml is non-existent that we don't have any drug that was developed by their male model or even not developed by at least even you that ml model plays a significant role I think this area was all the new ability to generate molecules with desired properties to do in silica screening is really a big open area in to be totally honest with you now when we are doing diagnostics and imaging primarily taking the ideas that we develop for other areas and you applying them with some adaptation the area of you know drug design is very technically interesting and exciting area you need to work a lot with graphs and capture various 3d properties there are lots and lots of opportunities to be technically creative and I think there are a lot of open questions in this area you know we're already getting a lot of successes even you know with the kind of the first generation of this models but there is much more new creative things that you can do and what's very nice to see is it actually the you know the the more powerful the more interesting models actually do do better so there is a place to to innovate in machine learning in this area and some of these techniques are really unique to let's say to you know graph generation and other things so what just an interpreter quick I'm sorry graph generation or graphs drug discovery in general what's what how do you discover a drug is this chemistry is this trying to predict different chemical reactions or is it some kind of water graphs even represented in this paper and what's a drug okay so let's say you think there are many different types of drugs but let's say you're gonna talk about small molecules because I think today the majority of drugs are small molecules so small molecule is a graph the molecule is just where the node in the graph is an atom and then you have the bone so it's really a graph representation if you look at it in 2d correct you can do it 3d but let's say well let's keep it simple and stick in 2d so pretty much my understanding today how it is done a scale in the companies you're without machine learning you have high throughput screening so you know that you are interested to get certain biological activity over the compound so you scan a lot of compounds like maybe hundreds of thousands some really big number of compounds you identify some compounds which have the right activity and then at this point you know the chemists come and they're trying to now to optimize this original heat to different properties that you want it to be maybe soluble you want to decrease tax ECG you want to decrease the side effects against your dropper can that be done in simulation or just by looking at the molecules or do you need to actually run reactions and real labs with lab it is so when you do high throughput screening you really do screening it's in the lab it's it's really the lab screening you screen the molecules corrected screening you just check them for certain property like in the physical space in the physical world like actually there's a machine probably that's doing some actually running the race actually running reactions yeah so so there is a process where you can run in this race go high through bodily you know it become cheaper and faster to do it and very big number of molecules you run the screaming you identify potential you know potential good starts and then we're the chemists come in who you know I've done it many times and then they can try to look at it and say how can I change the Millennial to get the desired profile in terms of all other properties so maybe how do you make it more by octave and so on and they're you know the creativity of the chemist really is the one the determines the success of this design because again they have a lot of domain knowledge you know what works how do you decrease the CCD and so on and that's what they do so all the drugs that are currently you know in the fda-approved Iraq serving drugs that are in clinical trials they are designed using these domain experts which goes through this combinatorial space of molecular graphs or whatever and find the right one now adjust it to be the right ones sounds like the the breast density heuristic from sixty seven the same echoes it's unnecessary is that it's really you know it's really driven by deep understand it so like they just observe it I mean they do deeply understand chemistry and they do understand how different groups and how does it changes the properties so there is a lot of science it gets into it and a lot of kind of simulation how do you want it to behave it eats very very complex they're quite effective at this is no effective yeah we have drugs like a spinning in how do you measure effect if if you measure it's in terms of cost its prohibitive if you measure the incidence of times you know we have lots of diseases for which we don't have any drugs and we don't even know how to approach and don't need to mention few drugs on your generative disease drugs that fail you know so there are lots of you know trials of face you know in later stages which is really catastrophic from the financial perspective so you know is it is it the effective the most effective mechanism absolutely no but this is the only one that currently works and I would you know I was closely interacting was fueling pharmaceutical industry I was really fascinating on how sharp and and what a deep understanding of the domain do they have it's not an observation driven it's there is really a lot of science behind what they do but if you ask me can machine learning change it I firmly believe yes because even the most experienced chemist cannot you know hold in their memory and understanding ever since you can learn you know from millions of molecules and reactions and and this piece of grass is a totally new space I mean it's a it's a really interesting space for machine learning to explore graph generation yeah so there's a lot of thing that you can do here so we do a lot of work so the first tool that we started with was the tool that can predict properties of the molecules so you can just give the molecular molecule and the property it can be by activity property or it can be some other property and you train the molecules and you can now take a new molecule and predict this property now when people started working in this area it is something very simple and they're kind of existing you know fingerprints which is kind of handcrafted features of the molecule when you break the graph to substructures and then you run it in a feed-forward neural network and what it was interesting to see that clearly you know this was not the most effective way to proceed and you need to have much more complex models that can induce the representation which can translate this graph into the embeddings and and do these predictions so this is one direction and another direction which is kind of related is not only to stop by looking at the embedding itself but actually modify it to produce better molecules so you can think about it as the machine translation that you can start with a molecule and then there is an improved version of molecular and you can again within coda translate it into the hidden space and then learn how to modify to improve the in some ways version of the molecules so that's it's kind of really exciting we already seen that the property prediction works pretty well and now we are generating molecules and there is actually loves which are manufacturing this molecule so we'll see why it will get us okay that's really exciting that so there's a lot of promise speaking of machine translation and embeddings I think you do you have done a lot of really great research in NLP natural language processing can you tell me your journey through NLP what ideas problems approaches were you working on were you fascinated with did you explore before this magic of deep learning re-emerged and after so when I started for my working in LP it was the 97th this is very interesting time it was exactly the time that I came to ACL and the time I could barely understand English but it was exactly like the transition point because half of the papers where really you know rule-based approaches where people took more kind of heavy linguistic approaches for small domains and try to build up from there and then they were the first generation of papers which were corpus based papers and they were very simple in our terms when you collect some statistics and do prediction based on them and I found it really fascinating that you know one community can think so very differently about you know about the problem and I remember the first paper that I wrote it didn't have a single formula it didn't have evaluation it just had examples of outputs and this was a standard of the field at a time in some ways I mean people maybe just started emphasizing the empirical evaluation but for many applications like summarization your interest or some examples of outwards and then increasingly you can see that how the statistical approach is dominated the field and we've seen you know increased performance across many basic tasks the sad part of the story may be that if you look again through this journey we see that the role of linguistics in some ways greatly diminishes and I think that you really need to look through the whole proceeding to do to find Martin to papers which make some interesting linguistic references it's really today today today this was different active trees just even basically against our conversation about human understanding of language which I guess what linguistic this would be structured parkour represent representing language in a way that's human explainable understandable is missing know if it is what is explainable and understandable in the end you know we perform functions and it's okay do you have machine which performs a function like when you're thinking about your calculator correct your calculator can do calculation very different from you would do the calculation but it's very effective I mean and this is fine if we can achieve certain tasks with high accuracy it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to understand it the same way as we understand in some ways it's even the eve to request because you have so many other sources of information that are absent when you are training your system so it's ok is it delivers it I never tell you one application this is really fascinating in 97 when it came to ACL there was some papers on machine translation they were like primitive like people were trying really really simple and the feeling my feeling wasn't you know to make real machine translation system it's like to fly and the moon and build a house there in the garden and live happily ever after I mean it's like impossible I never could imagine that within you know 10 years we would already see the system working and now you know nobody is even surprised to utilize the system on daily basis so this was like a huge huge progress saying that people for very long time try to solve using other mechanisms and they were unable to solve it that's why coming back to a question about biology then you know in linguistics people try to go this way and try to write the the syntactic trees and try to abstract it and to find the right representation and you know they couldn't get very five with this understanding while these models using you know other sources actually cable to make a lot of progress now I'm not naive to think but we are in this paradise space in NLP and shows you know that when we slightly change the domain and when we decrease the amount of training it can do like really bizarre and funny thing but I think it's just a matter of improving generalization capacity which is just a technical question Wow so that's that's the question how much of language understanding can be solved with deep neural networks in your intuition I mean it's unknown I suppose but as we start to creep towards romantic notions of the spirit of the Turing test and conversation and dialogue and something that may be to to me or to us silly humans feels like it needs real understanding how much can I be achieved with these neural networks or statistical methods so I guess I am very much driven by the human by the outcomes can we achieve the performance which will be satisfactory for for us for different tasks now if you again look at machine translation system which are you know trained on large amounts of data they really can do a remarkable job relatively to where they've been a few years ago and if you you know if you project into the future if it will be the same speed of improvement you know this is great now does it bother me that it's not doing the same translation as we are doing now if you go to cognitive science we still don't really understand what we are doing I mean there are a lot of theories so there is obviously a lot of progress and standing but our understanding what exactly goes on you know in our brains when we process language it's still not crystal clear and precise that we can translate it into machines what does bother me is that you know again that machines can be extremely brittle when you go out of your comfort zone of that when there is a distributional shift between training and testing and it have been years and years every year when I teach NOP class you know show them some examples of translation from some newspaper in Hebrew whatever it was perfect and then they have a recipe that to me a closed system sent me a while ago and it was written in Finnish of Karelian pies and it's just a terrible translation you cannot understand anything what it does it's not like some syntactic mistakes it's just terrible in year after year I try and interview translate in the end after year it does it's terrible walk because I guess you know the recipe is a no big part of their training refers to our so but in terms of outcomes that's a really clean good way to look at it I guess the question I was asking is do you think the imagine of future do you think the current approaches can pass the Turing test in the way in the best possible formulation of the Turing test is would you want to have a conversation within your own network for an hour Oh God but there are some people in this world alive or not that you would like to talk to for an hour could in your network of achieve that outcome so I think it would be really hard to create a successful training set we renamed Valene together conversation for a contextual conversation for an hour it's a problem of data I think in some ways it's informative it's a problem both of data and the problem of the way we are training our systems their ability to truly to generalize to be very compositional in some ways it limited you know if in the current capacity at least you know we can translate well we can you know find information well we can extract information so there are many capacities and which is doing very well and you can ask me would you trust the machine to translate for you and use it as a source I would say absolutely especially if we are talking about newspaper date or other data which is in the rearm of its own training so I would say yes but you know having conversations with the machine it's not something that I would choose to do but you know I would tell you something talking about Turing test and about all this kind of eliezer conversations I remember visiting tents and in China and they have this chat board and they claim it is like really humongous amount of the local population which like four hours talks to the child what to me it was I cannot believe it but apparently it's like documented that there are some people who enjoy this conversation and you know it brought to me the another MIT story about Eliza and wasting bomb I don't know if you familiar with the store service in Bonn was a professor at MIT and when he developed this Eliza which was just doing string matching very trivial like restating of what you said with very few rules no syntax apparently they were secretaries at MIT that would sit for hours and converse with this trivial thing and at the time there was no beautiful interfaces so you actually need to go through the pain of communicating and the wisdom bound himself was so horrified by this phenomena that people can believe in after the machine you just need to give them the hint that machine understands you and you can complete the rest that he kind of stopped this research and went into kind of trying to understand what these artificial intelligence can do to our brains so my point is you know how much it's not how good is the technology is how ready we are to believe that it delivers the goods that we are trying to get that's a really beautiful way to put it I I by the way I'm not horrified by that possibility but inspired by it because I mean human connection whether it's through language or through love it it seems like it's very amenable to machine learning and the rest is just challenges of psychology thank you said the secretaries who enjoy spending hours I would say I would describe most of our lives as enjoying spending hours with those we love for very silly reasons all we're doing is keyword matching as well so I'm not sure how much intelligence we exhibit to each other you know with the people we love that we're close with so it's a very interesting point of what it means to pass the Turing test well language I think you're right in terms of conversation I think machine translation is it has very clear performance and improvement right what it means to have a fulfilling conversation is very very person dependent and context dependent and so on that's a yeah it's very well put so but in your view what's a benchmark a natural language a test that's just out of reach right now but we might be able to that's exciting is it a machine isn't perfecting machine translation or is there other is it summarization what's what's out there it goes across specific application it's more about the ability to learn from few examples for real what we call future learning and all these cases because you know the way we publish these papers today we say if we have like a naively we get 55 but now we had a few example and we can move to 65 none of these methods actually realistically doing anything useful you cannot use them today and their ability to be able to generalize and to move or to be autonomous in finding the data that you need to learn to be able to perfect new tasks or new language this is an area where I think we really need to to move forward to and we are not yet there are you at all excited curious by the possibility of creating human level intelligence is this is you've been very in your discussion so if we're looking at oncology you're trying to use machine learning to help the world in terms of alleviating suffering if you look at natural language processing you focus on the outcomes of improving practical things like machine translation but you know human level intelligence is the thing that our civilization is dreaming about creating superhuman level intelligence do you think about this do you think it's at all within our reach so as you said to yourself for any I'm talking about you know how do you perceive you know our communications with each other that you know we're matching keywords and certain behaviors and so all so in the end whenever one assesses let's say relations with another person you have a separate kind of measurements and outcomes inside you had the determine you know what is the status of the relation so one way and this is classical dilemma what is the intelligence is it the fact that now we are gonna do the same way as human is doing when we don't even understand what the human is doing or we now have an ability to deliver this outcomes but not in one area not in a non fear not just to translate or just answer questions but it was many many areas that we can achieve the functionality is that humans can achieve with the ability to learn and do other things I think this is and this we can actually measure how far we are and that's what makes me excited that we you know in my lifetime at least so far what we've seen it's like tremendous progress across with these different functionalities and I think it will be really exciting to see where we will be and again one way to think about is there are machines which are improving their functionality another one is to think about us with our brains which I'm perfect how they can be accelerated by this technology as it becomes stronger and stronger coming back to another book that I love flowers for algernon have you read this book yes so there is this point that then the patient gets this miracle cure which changes his brain and of a sudden the he life in a different way and can do certain things better but certain things much worse so you can imagine this kind of computer augmented cognition where it can bring you that now in the same way as you know the cars enable us to get to places where we've never been before can we think differently can we think faster so and we already see a lot of it happening in how it impacts us but I think we have a long way to go there so that's sort of artificial intelligence and technology affecting our augmenting our intelligence as humans yesterday a company called neural link announced they do this whole demonstration I don't know if you saw it it's they demonstrated brain computer brain machine interface whether it's like a sewing machine for the brain do you uh you know a lot of that is quite out there in terms of things that some people would say are impossible but there are dreamers and want to engineer systems like that do you see based on what you just said I hope for that more direct interaction with the brain i I think there are different ways one is a direct interaction with the brain and again there are lots of companies that work in this space and I think there will be a lot of developments when I'm just saying that many times we are not aware of our feelings of motivation what drives us like let me give you a trivial example our attention there are a lot of studies in demonstrate that it takes a while to a person to understand that they are not attentive anymore and we know that there are people who really have strong capacity to hold the tension there are another end of the spectrum people with a DD and other issues they have problem to regulate their attention imagine to yourself do you have like a cognitive aid this just alerts you based on your gaze that your attention is now not on what you are doing and it's sort of writing a paper you're now dreaming of what you're going to do in the evening so even this kind of simple measurement things how they can change us and I see it even in these simple ways with myself I have my zone up from that I go to MIT gym it kind of records you know how much the Duran and you have points and you could get some status whatever like what is this ridiculous thing who would ever care about some status in some up guess what so took it to me to contain the status you have to do certain number of points every month and not only is that they do it every single month for the last 18 months it went to the poem that I was running and the day I was injured and when I could run again I in two days I did like some humongous amount of ready to complete the point I was like really not safe music I'm not gonna lose my status so you can already see that this direct measurement and the feedback it's you know we're looking at video games and see why you know the addiction aspect of it but you can imagine that the same idea can be expanded to many other areas of our life when we really can get feedback and imagine in your case in relations when we are doing keyword matching imagine that the person who is generating the keywords that first one gets direct feedback before the whole thing explodes is it maybe a point we are going in the wrong direction really behavior modifying moment so yeah it's a relationship management - so yeah that's that's a fascinating whole area of psychology actually as well as seeing how our behavior has changed with basically all human relations now have other non-human entities helping us out so you uh you teach a large a huge machine learning course here at MIT I can ask you a million questions but you've seen a lot of students what ideas do students struggle with the most as they first enter this world of machine learning actually this year was the first time I started teaching a small machine learning class and it came as a result of what I saw in my big machine learning class the to me Ackland I build maybe six years ago what we've seen that as this area become more and more popular more and more people at MIT want to take this class and while we designed it for computer science majors there were a lot of people who really I interested to learn in but unfortunately their background was not enabling them to do well in the class and many of them associated machine learning with the would struggle in failure primarily for non-majors and that's why which restarts the new class which we call machine learning from algorithms to modeling which emphasizes more the modeling aspects of it and focuses on it has majors and non-majors so we kind of try to extract the relevant paths and make it more accessible because the fact that we're teaching 20 classifiers in standard machine learning class it's really a big question we really needed but it was interesting to see this from first generation of students you know when they came back from their internships and from their jobs what different and exciting things they can do is it I would never think that you can even apply machine learning - some of them are like matching you know their relations and you know that actually brings up an interesting point of computer science in general it almost seems maybe I'm crazy but it almost seems like everybody needs to learn how to program these days if you're 20 years old or if you're starting school even if you're an English major it seems it seems like programming unlocks so much possibility in this world so in when you interact with those non majors is their skills that they were simply lacking at the time that you wish they had and that they learned in high school and so on like how will it how should education change in this computer computerized the world that we live in seen because they knew that is a Python component in the class you know their Python skills we're okay and the class is not really heavy on programming they were primarily kind of add parts to the programs I think it was more of them mathematical barriers and the class against with the design on the majors was using the notation like Big O for complexity and others if people who come from different backgrounds just don't have it in the lexicon it's unnecessarily very challenging notion but they were just not aware so I think that you know kind of linear algebra and probability the basics that calculus won't variate calculus a thing that can help what advice would you give the students interested in machine learning interested you've talked about detecting curing cancer drug design if they want to get into that field what what should they do get into it and succeed as researchers and entrepreneurs the first good piece of news is right now there are lots of resources that you know are created at different levels and you can find online on school classes which are more mathematical more applied and so on so you can find kind of a preacher which preaches your own language where you can enter the field and you can make many different types of contribution depending of you know what is your strengths and the second point I think it's really important to find some area which you which you really care about and it can motivate your learning and it can be for somebody curing cancer or doing self-driving cars so whatever but to find an area where you know there is data where you believe there are strong patterns and we should be doing it and we're still not doing it oh you can do it better and just start there and see where it can bring you so you've you've been very successful in many directions in life but you also mentioned flowers of Argan on and I think I've read or listened to you mention somewhere that researchers often get lost in the details of their work this is per our original discussion with cancer and so on and don't look at the bigger picture bigger questions of meaning and so on so let me ask you the impossible question of what's the meaning of this thing of life of your life of research why do you think we descendant of great apes are here on this spinning ball you know I don't think that I have really a global answer you know maybe that's why I didn't go to humanities and then thank University's Colossus in undergrad but the way I'm thinking about it that each one of us inside of them have their own set of you know things that we believe I important and it just happens that we are busy with achieving various goal of busy listening to others and to kind of try to conform and to be part of the crowd that we don't listen to that part and you know yeah we all should find some time to understand what is our own individual missions and we may have very different missions and to make sure that while we are running ten thousand things we are not you know missing out and we're putting all the resources to satisfy our own mission and if I look over my time when I was younger most of these missions you know I was primarily driven by the external stimulus you know to achieve there so to be that and now a lot of what I do is driven by really thinking what is important for me to achieve independently of the external recognition and you know I don't mind to be viewed in certain ways the most important thing for me is to be true to myself to what I think is right how long did it take how hard was it to find the user you have to be true to so it takes time and even now sometimes you know the vanity and the triviality can take a MIG yeah it can everywhere it you know it's just the vanity item it is different the vanity in different places but we all have our piece of vanity but I think actually for me the many times the place to get back to it is you know when I when I'm alone and also when I read and I think by selecting the right books you can get the right questions and learn from what you read so but but again it's not perfect like vanities - dominates well that's a beautiful way to end thank you so much for talking today yeah that's fun why it was fun you
