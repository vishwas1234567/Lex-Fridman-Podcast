 the following is a conversation with William McCaskill he's a philosopher ethicists and one of the originators of the effective altruism movement his research focuses on the fundamentals of effective altruism are the use of evidence and reason to help others but as much as possible with our time and money with a particular concentration on how to act given moral uncertainty he's the author of doing good better effective altruism and a radical new way to make a difference he is a co-founder and the president of the center of effective altruism CEA that encourages people to commit to donate at least 10 percent of their income to the most effective charities he co-founded 80,000 dollars which is a nonprofit that provides research and advice on how you can best make a difference through your career this conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the corona virus pandemic for everyone feeling the medical psychological and financial burden of this crisis I'm sending love your way stay strong or in this together we'll beat this thing this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on YouTube review it with five stars an apple podcast support on patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter Alex Friedman spelled Fri D ma n as usual I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never in the ads in the middle they can break the flow or the conversation I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience this show is presented by cap the number one finance I up in the App Store when you get it you just collects podcast cash your app lets you send money to friends buy Bitcoin and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar since cash app allows you to send and receive money digitally peer-to-peer and security in all digital transactions is very important let me mention the PCI data security standard that cash app is compliant with I'm a big fan of standards for safety and security PCI DSS is a good example of that where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and AI systems in general so again if you get cash app from the App Store or Google Play and use the code Lex podcast you get ten dollars in cash wrap will also donate ten dollars to first an organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world and now here's my conversation with William McCaskill what is utopia for humans and all life on Earth look like for you that's a great question what I want to say is that we don't know and the Utopia we want to get to is an indirect one that I call the long reflection so period of post-scarcity no longer have the kind of urgent problems we have today but instead can spend perhaps it's tens of thousands of years debating engaging ethical reflection in order before we take any kind of drastic lock in actions like spreading to the Stars and then we can figure out what is like what is of kind of moral value a long reflection as a that's a really beautiful term so if we look at Twitter for just a second do you think human beings are able to reflect in a productive way I don't mean to make you sound bad because there is a lot of fights and politics and division in our discourse maybe if you zoom out it actually is civilized discourse it might not feel like it but when you zoom out but so I don't want to say that Twitter is not civilized discourse I actually believe it it's more civilized than people give it credit for but do you think the long reflection can actually be stable where we as human beings with our descendants of a brains would be able to sort of rationally discuss things together and arrive at ideas I think overall we're pretty good at discussing things rationally and you know at least in the earlier stages of our mind be other lives being open to many different ideas and being able to be convinced and change our views I think that Twitter's designed almost to bring out all the worst tendencies so if the long reflection were conducted on Twitter you know maybe would be better just not even not even to bother but I think the challenge really is getting to a stage where we have a society that is as conducive as possible to rational reflection to deliberation I think we're actually very lucky to be in a liberal society where people are able to discuss a lot of ideas and so on I think when we look to the future that's not at all guaranteed that society would be like that rather than less I rather than a society where there's a fixed Canon of values that are being imposed on all society and where you aren't able to question that that would be very bad for my perspective because it means we wouldn't be able to figure out what the truth is I can already sense we're gonna go down yeah a million tangents but what do you think is the if Twitter is not optimal what kind of mechanism this modern age of technology can we design where the exchange of ideas could be both civilized and productive and yet not to be not be too constrained where there's rules of what you can say and can't say which is as you say is not desirable but yet not have some limits as what can be said or not and so on do you have any ideas thoughts on a possible future of course nobody knows how to do it but do you have thoughts of what a better Twitter might look like I think that text-based media are intrinsically going to be very hard to be conducive to professional discussion because if you think about it from a non informational perspective if I just send you a text of less than what is it now two hundred and forty characters doing than 80 characters I think that's a tiny amount of information compared to say you and I talking now where you have access to the words I say which is the same as in text but also my tone also my body language and we're very poorly designed to be able to assess you know I have to read all this context into anything you say so you know I say you may be your partner sends you a text and as a full-stop at the end are they mad at you right you don't know you have to infer everything about this person's mental state from whether they put a full staff at the end of a text or know where the flip side of that is it truly text that's the problem here because there's a there's a viral aspect to the text where it's you could just post text non-stop it's very immediate you know in the times before Twitter before the internet you know the way you would exchange texts is you write books yeah and that while it doesn't get body language it doesn't get tone it doesn't so on but it does actually boil down after some time thinking some editing so on boil down ideas so so yeah it's is the immediacy and the viral nature the out that which produces the outrage mobs and so on the potential problem I think that is a big issue I think there's going to be the strong selection effect where something provokes outrage well that's high arousal you're more likely to to retweet that where there's kind of so bill analysis is not as sexy not as viral I do agree that long-form content is much better to productive discussion in terms of the media that very popular at the moment I think the podcasting is great where like your podcast for two hours long so they're much more than depth than Twitter are and you are able to convey so much more nuance so much more caveat because it's an actual conversation it's more like the sort of communication that we've evolved to do rather than kind of these very small little snippets of ideas that when also combined with bad incentives just clearly aren't designed for helping us get to the truth it's kind of interesting there it's not just the length of the podcast medium but it's the fact that was started by people that don't give a damn about quote unquote the man yet of that it's there's a relaxed sort of the style like that Joe Rogan does there's a freedom took to to express ideas in a unconstrained way that's very real it's kind of funny in that it feels so refreshing Lee real to us today and I wonder what the future looks like it's a little bit sad now that quite a lot of sort of more popular people are getting into podcasting mm-hmm and then like me you know and like and they they tried to sort of create they try to control it they try to constrain it in different kinds of ways people I love like Conan O'Brien and so on different comedians and I'd love to see where the the real aspects of this podcast and medium persists maybe in TV maybe in YouTube maybe Netflix is pushing those kind of ideas and it's kind of it's a really exciting word that kind of sharing of knowledge yeah I mean I think it's a double-edged sword as it becomes more popular and more profitable where on the one hand you'll get a lot more creativity people doing more interesting things with the medium but also perhaps you get this place to the bottom where suddenly maybe pod will be hard to find good content on podcasts because it'll be so overwhelmed by you know the latest bit of viral outrage so speaking of that jumping on effective attrition for a second so so much of that internet content is funded by advertisements just in your in the context of effective altruism we're talking about Inc the the the richest companies in the world they're funded by advertisements essentially Google that's their primary source William do you see that as do you have any criticism of that source of income do you see that source of money as a potentially powerful source of money that could be used well certainly can be used for good but is there something bad about that source of money I think the significant worries with it where it means that the incentives of the company might be quite misaligned with you know making people's lives better where again perhaps the incentives are towards increasing drama and debate on your social news social media feed in order the more people are going to be engaged perhaps kind of compulsively involved with the platform whereas there are other business models like having an opt-in subscription service where perhaps they have other issues but there's much more of a incentive to provide a product that its users are just like really wanting because you know now I'm paying for this product I'm paying for this thing I want to buy rather than I'm trying to use this thing and it's gonna get a profit mechanism that is somewhat orthogonal to me actually just wanting to use the use the product and so I mean in some cases it will work better than others I can imagine a I can in theory you imagine Facebook movie having a subscription service but I think it's you know unlikely to happen anytime soon well it's interesting and it's weird now that you bring it up that it's unlikely this example I pay I think 10 bucks a month for YouTube's bread mm-hmm and that's another thing I get it much for that except just so no ads yeah but in general it's just a slightly better experience and I would gladly now I'm not wealthy in fact I'm operating very close to zero dollars but I would pay 10 bucks a month to Facebook content mok's a month to Twitter yeah for some kind of more control yeah in terms of advertisements and so on but the other aspect of that is data yeah personal data people are really sensitive about this and I'm I as one who hopes to one day create a company that may may use people's data to do good for the world wonder about this for one the psychology of why people are so paranoid well I understand why but they seem to be more paranoid than it's justified at times and the other is how do they do it right so it seems that Facebook is it seems that Facebook is doing it wrong that's certainly the part of the popular narrative it's unclear to me actually how wrong like I tend to give him more benefit of the doubt because there you know it's a really hard thing to do right mmm and people don't listen realize it but how do we respect in your view people's privacy yeah I mean in the case of how worried are people about using the data I mean there's a lot of public debate and criticism about it when we look at people's revealed preferences yeah you know people's continuing massive use of these sorts of services it's not clear to me how much people really do care perhaps they care a bit but they're happy to in effect kind of sell their data in order to be able to get you a certain service that's a great term reveal preferences so these aren't preferences your self-report in a survey this is like your actions speak yeah exactly so you might say oh yeah I hate the idea of Facebook having my data but then when it comes to it you actually are willing to give that data in exchange for being able to use the service and if that's the case then I think unless we have some explanation about why why there's some negative externality from that or why there's some coordination failure or if there's something that consumers are just really misled about where they don't realize why giving away data like this is a really bad thing to do then ultimately I kind of want to you know respect people's preferences they can give away their data if they want I think there's a big difference between companies use of data and governments having data where you know looking at the particular code of history at governments knowing a lot about their people can be very bad if the government chooses to do bad things with it and that's more wedding I think so let's jump into it a little bit most people know but actually I two years ago I had no idea what effective altruism was until I saw there's a cool-looking event in an MIT group here mm-hmm they I think the it's called the effective altruism Club or a group that's like what the heck is that yeah and one of my friends said I mean they he said that they're just eccentric characters I was like hell yes I'm in so I went to one of their events and looked up what's it about it's quite a fascinating philosophical and just a movement of ideas so can you tell me what is effective altruism great so the core of effective altruism is about to answer this question which is how can I do as much good as possible with my scarce resources my time and with my money and then once we have our best guess answers to that trying to take those ideas and put that into practice and do those things that we believe will do the most good and we're now a community of people many thousands of us around the world who really are Tanna answer that question as best we can and then use our time and money to make the world better so what's the difference between sort of classical general idea of altruism and effective altruism so normally when people will try to do good they often often just aren't so reflective about those attempts so someone might approach you in the street asking you to give to charity and you'll you know if you're feeling out a stick you'll give to the person on the street or if you think oh I want to do some good in my life you might volunteer at a local place or perhaps you'll decide you know pursue a career where you're working in a field that's kind of more obviously beneficial like being a doctor or a nurse or health care professional but it's very rare that people apply the same level of rigor and analytical thinking to lots of other areas we think about so take the case of someone approaching you in the street imagine if that person instead was saying hey I've got this amazing company do you want to invest in it it would be insane and no one would ever think oh of course I'm just a company like you'd think it was a scam but somehow we don't have that same level of rigor when it comes to doing good even though the stakes are more important when it comes to trying to help others then kind of make money for ourselves well first of all so there is a psychology at the individual level of doing good just feels good yes and so in some sense and that's pure psychological part it doesn't matter in fact you don't want to know if it does good or not because most of the time it won't yeah so like in a certain sense it's understandable why altruism without the effective part is so appealing to a certain population by the way let's zoom off for a second do you think most people to questions do you think most people are good and question number two is do you think most people want to do good so are most people good I think it's just super dependent on the circumstances that someone is in I think that the actions people take and their moral worth is just much more dependent on circumstance than it is on someone's intrinsic character so there's an evil within it seems like like with the better angels of our nature there's a tendency of us as a society to tend towards good less war I mean with all these metrics hmm what is that us becoming who we want to be or is that some kind of societal force what's the nature versus nurture thing here yes so in that case I just think yeah so violence has massively declined over time I think that's a slow process of cultural evolution institutional evolution such that now the incentives for you and I to be violent a very very small indeed in contrast when we were hunter-gatherers the incentives were quite large if there was someone who was you know potentially disturbing the social order and hunter-gatherer setting there was a very strong incentive to kill that person and people did and it was just the guarded you know 10% of deaths among hunter-gatherers all arguably were murders after a hunter gatherers when you have actual societies is when bars can probably go up because there's more incentive to do mass violence right to take over all their conquer other people's lands and murder everybody in place and so on yeah I mean I think total death leaf the mother heap from human causes does go down but you're right that if you're in a hunter-gatherer situation you're you kind of group that you're part of is very small then you know you can't have massive wars that just massive communities does exist but anyway there the second question eating most people want to do good yeah and then I think that is true for most people I think you see that with the fact that you know most people donate a large proportion of people volunteer if you give people opportunities to easily help other people they will take it but at the same time we're a product of our circumstances and if it were more socially rewarded to be doing more good if it were more socially the water to do good effectively about them not effectively then we would see that behavior a lot more why why should we do good yeah my answer to this is there's no kind of deeper level of explanation so my answer to kind of why should you good is well there is someone whose life is on the line for example whose life you can save via donating just actually a few thousand dollars to an effective nonprofit and like the against malaria foundation that is a sufficient reason to do good and then if you ask well why or I do that and like I just show you the same facts again those it's that fact that is the reason to do good there's nothing more fundamental than that I'd like to sort of make more concrete the thing we're trying to make better so you just mentioned malaria so there's a huge amount of suffering in the world are we trying to remove so is ultimately the goal not ultimately but the first step is to remove the worst of the suffering so there's some kind of threshold of suffering they want to make sure it does not exist in the world or do we really naturally want to take a much further step and look at things like income inequality so not just getting everybody above a certain threshold but making sure that there is some that that is broadly speaking there's less injustice in the world unfairness in some definition of course very difficult to define a fairness yeah so the metric I use is how many people do we affect and by how much do we affect them and so that can you know often that means eliminating suffering but it doesn't have to could be helping promote a flourishing life instead and so if I was comparing you know reducing income inequality or a limb you know getting people from the very pits of suffering to a higher level the app the question I would ask is just a quantitative one of just if I do this first thing of a second thing how many people am I going to benefit and by how much am I going to benefit am I going to move that one person from kind of 10% 0% well-being to 10% well-being perhaps that's just not as good as moving a hundred people from 10% well-being to 50% well-being and the idea is the diminishing returns is the idea of one year the when you're in terrible poverty then the one dollar that you give goes much further than if you were in the middle class in the United States for example absolutely and this this fact is really striking so if you take even just quite a conservative estimate of how we are able to turn money into well-being The Economist put it as like a log curve that's the or steeper but that means that any proportional increase in your income has the same impact on your well-being and so someone moving from thousand dollars a year to two thousand dollars a year has the same impact to someone moving from a hundred thousand dollars a year to two hundred thousand dollars a year and then when you combine that with the fact that we in middle class members of rich countries are a hundred times richer than financial terms in the global poor that means we can do a hundred times to benefit the poorest people in the world as we can to benefit people of our income level and that's this astonishing fact yeah it's it's quite incredible a lot of these facts and ideas are just difficult to think about because there's an overwhelming amount of suffering in the world and even acknowledging it is difficult not exactly sure why that is I mean I mean it's difficult because you have to bring to mind you know it's an unpleasant experience thinking about other people suffering it's unpleasant to be empathizing with it firstly and then secondly thinking about it means that maybe we'd have to change our lifestyles and if you're very attached to the income that you've got perhaps you don't want to be confronting ideas or arguments that might cause you to use some of that money to help others so it's quite understandable in the psychological terms even if it's not the right thing that we ought to be doing so how can we do better how can we be more effective how does data help yeah in general how can how can we do better it's definitely hard and we have spent the last ten years engaged in kind of some deeper search projects so today an answer can two questions one is of all the many problems the world is facing what are the problems we ought to be focused on and then within those problems that we judge to become the most pressing where we use this idea of focusing on problems that are the biggest in scale there are the most fact able where we can do have the kind of make the most progress on that problem and there are the most neglected within them what the things that are have the kind of best evidence or we have the best guest will do the most good and so we have a bunch of organizations so I give well for example is focused on global health and development and has a list of seven top recommended charities so the idea in general and sorry to interrupt is so what doc was sort of poverty and Emma will flare an existential risk this is all fascinating topics but in general the idea is there should be a group not sorry there's a lot of groups that seek to convert money into good and then you also on top of that want to have a accounting of how good they actually did perform that conversion how well they did in converting money to good so ranking of these different groups ranking this the charities so that does that apply across basically all aspects of effective altruism so there should be a group of people and they should be they should report on certain metrics on how well they've done and you should only give your money to groups that do a good job that's the core idea I'd make two comments one is just it's not just about money so we're also trying to encourage people to work in areas where they'll have the biggest impact absolutely and in some areas you know they're really people heavy but money poor other areas of the money which and people poor and so whether it's better to focus time or money um depends on the cause area and then the second is that you mentioned metrics and while that's the ideal and in some areas we do we are able to get somewhat quantitative information about how much impact an area is having that's not always true for some of the issues like you mentioned existential risks well we're not able to measure in any sort of precise way like how much progress we're making and so you have to instead fall back on just a regular sgt and evaluation even in the absence of data so as let's first sort of linger on your own story for a second how do you yourself practice effective altruism in your own life because I think that's really interesting place to start so I've tried to build effective altruism into at least many components of my life so on the donation side my plan is to give away most of my income over the course of my life I've got a set bar I feel happy with and I just donate above that bar so at the moment I donate about twenty percent of my income then on the career side I've also shifted kind of what I do where I was initially planning to work on very esoteric topics in the philosophy of logic for us whose language things that have intellectually extremely interesting but the path by which they really make a difference to the world is let's just say it's very unclear that at best and so I switched and said to researching ethics to actually just working on this question of how we can do as much good as possible and then I've also spent a very large chunk of my life over the last ten years creating a number of nonprofits who again in different ways are tackling this question of how we can do the most good and helping them to grow over time - yeah we'll mention a few of them of the career selection 80,000 80,000 hours 80,000 hours and a really interesting group so maybe also just a quick pause on the origins of effective altruism because you paint a picture who the key figures are including yourself in the effect of ultras movement today yeah there are two main strands that can I came together to form the effect of altruism movement so one was two philosophers myself and Toby awed at Oxford and we had been very influenced by the work of Peter Singer and Australian moral philosopher who had argued for many decades that because one can do so much good at such little cost to oneself we have an obligation to give away most of our income to benefit those and actually in poverty just in the same way that we have an obligation to run in and save a child from Adamic finish planning in a shallow pond if it would just tell you in your suit to the coaster a few thousand dollars and we set up given what we can in 2009 which is encouraging people to give at least 10 percent of our income to the most effective charities and the second main strand was the formation of giveWell which was originally based in New York and started in about 2007 and that was set up by Holden canossian le Hassenfeld who were two hedge fund dudes who you know making making good money and thinking well where should I donate and in the same way as if they wanted to buy a product for themselves they would look at Amazon reviews they were like well what are the best charities fans they just weren't really good answers to that question certainly not they were satisfied with and so they formed giveWell in order to try and work out what are those charities where they can have the biggest impact and then from there and some other influences can a community glue and spread can we explore the philosophical and political space that effective altruism occupies a little bit so from the little and distant in my own life time that I've read of Iran's work Iran's philosophy of Objectivism espouses and it's interesting to put her philosophy in contrast yeah with effective altruism so it espouses selfishness as the best thing you can do yeah and if you but it's not actually against altruism its if it's just you have that choice but you should be selfish in it right or not maybe you can disagree here but so it can be viewed as the complete opposite of effective altruism or it can be viewed as similar because the word effective is really interesting because if you want to do good then you should be damn good at doing good right that's the I think that would fit within the the morality that's defined by objectivism so do you see a connection between these two philosophies and other perhaps other in this in this complicated space of beliefs that effective altruism is positioned as opposing or lined with oh definitely say that objectivism England's philosophy is a philosophy that's you know quite fundamentally opposed to effective altruism in we can waive insofar as England's philosophy is about championing egoism and saying that are never quite sure whether the philosophy is meant to say that just you ought to do whatever will best benefit yourself as ethical egoism no matter what the consequences are or second if there's this alternative view which is well you ought to attain benefit yourself because that's actually the best way of benefiting society certainly in you know Atlas Shrugged she is presenting her philosophy as a way that's you know actually going to bring about a flourishing society and if it's the former then well effective altruism is all about promoting the idea of altruism so it's and saying in fact we ought really be trying to help others as much as possible so it's opposed there and then on the second side I would just dispute the empirical premise it would seem given the major problems in the world today it would seem like this remarkable coincidence quite suspicious one might say if benefiting myself was actually the best way to bring about a better world so in that point and I think that connects also with career selection that we'll talk about but let's consider not objectives but capitalism so and the idea that you focusing on the thing that you damn I are damn good at whatever that is yeah maybe the best thing for the world sort of part of it is also mindset right sort of like I the thing I love is robots yeah so maybe I should focus on building robots and never even think about the idea of effective altruism it which is kind of the capitalist notion yeah is there any value in that idea and just finding anything you're good at and maximizing your productivity in this world and thereby sort of lifting the ball boats and benefiting society and as a result yeah I think there's two things I'd want to say on that so one is what your comparative advantages what your strengths are when it comes to career there's obviously super important because you know there's lots of career paths I would be terrible at if I was thought being an artist was the best thing one could do well I'd be doomed just really it quite astonishingly bad and so I do think at least within the realm of things that could plausibly be very high impact yes choose the thing that you're gonna that you think you're going to be able to like really be passionate at and excel at kind of over the long term then on this question of like should one just do that in an unrestricted way and not even think about what the most important problems are I do think that in a kind of perfectly designed society that might well be the case that would be a society where we've collected all market failures we've internalized all externalities and then we've managed to set up incentives such that people just pursuing their own strengths is the best way of doing good but we're very far from that Society so if one did that then you know it would be very unlikely that you would focus on improving the lives of non-human animals that you know aren't participating in markets or ensuring the long-run future goes well we're future people certainly aren't participating in markets our benefiting the global poor who do participate but have so much less can a power from a starting perspective that their views on accurately kind of represented in by market forces to guarded so yeah the in serves pure pure definition capitalism and just seem may very well ignore the people that are suffering the most the wide swath of them so if you could allow me this line of thinking here so I've listened to a lot of your conversations Yellin I find if I can compliment you is there very interesting conversation is your conversation on Rogan and Joe Rogan's was really interesting with sam harris and so on whatever there's a lot of stuff that's really good out there and yet when I look at the internet and look at YouTube which has certain mobs certain swaths of right-leaning folks yeah whom I dearly love I love all people all especially people with ideas they seem to not like you very much so I don't understand why exactly so what my own sort of hypothesis is there is a right left divide that absurdly so caricatured in politics at least in the United States and maybe you're somehow pigeon-holed into one of those sides and there did you know maybe that that's what it is this may be your message is somehow politicized yeah I mean well how how do you make sense of that because you're extremely interesting like you got the the comments I see on Joe Rogan there's a bunch of negative stuff and yet if you listen to it the conversation is fascinating I'm not speaking I'm not some kind of lefty yeah extremist but just this a fascinating conversation so why are you getting some wine like nollamara hate so I'm actually pretty glad that effective altruism has managed to stay on relatively unpolitical because I think the core message just use some of your time and money to do as much good as possible to fight some of the problems in the world can be you know appealing across the political spectrum and we do have a diversity of political viewpoints among people who have engaged and effective altruism we do however do get some criticism from the left and the light was to Chris both Oh be interesting to hear yeah so criticism from the left is that we're not focused enough on dismantling the capitalist system that they see as the loot of most of the problems that we're talking about and there I kind of disagree on partly the premise where I don't think relevant alternative systems would say to the animals or to the the global poor which the future generations can a much better and then also the tactics where I think for the particular ways we can change society that would massively benefit you know be massively beneficial on those things that don't go via dismantling like the entire system which is perhaps a million times harder to do then criticism on the right there's definitely in like in response to the Joe Rogan podcast they definitely were a number of inland fans who weren't keen on the idea of promoting altruism there was a remarkable set of ideas just the idea of it affected unmanly I think was driving a lot of criticism let me okay so I love fighting I've been in street fights my whole life I'm uh I'm as alpha and everything I do as he gets and the fact that and Joe Rogan said that I thought scent of a woman is a better movie than John wick put me into this beta category among people core like basically saying this yeah unmanly or it's not tough it's not it's not some yeah principled view of strength that is represented by as possible and so actually so how do you think about this because to me altruism especially effective altruism is I don't I don't know what the female version of that is but on the male side manliest [ __ ] if I may say so so what how do you think about that kind of criticism I think people who would make that criticism are just occupying a like state of mind that I think is just so different from my state of mind that I kind of struggle to maybe even understand it where if something's manly or unmanly or feminine or unfeminine I'm like I don't care like is it the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do so yeah I let me put in that in terms of man a woman yeah I don't think that's useful but I think there's notion of acting out of fear yeah that or as opposed to out of principle and strength yeah so okay yeah here's something that I do you know feel as an intuition and that I think drives some people who do find kind of a and land attractive and and so on as a philosophy which is a kind of taking power of you're taking control of your own life and having power over how you're stealing your life and not kind of cowering to others you know really thinking things through I find like that set of ideas just very compelling and inspirational but I actually think of effective altruism has really Xenu that side of my personality it's like scratch that itch where you and just not taking the kind of priorities that society is giving you is granted instead you're choosing to act in accordance with the priorities that you think are most important in the world and often that involves then doing quite on quite unusual things from a societal perspective like donating a large chunk of your earnings or working on these weird issues about AI and so on that other people might not understand yeah I think that's a really gutsy thing to do that is taking control that's at least at this stage I mean that that's that's you taking ownership not of just yourself but your presence in this world that's full of suffering and saying as opposed to being paralyzed by that notion yeah it's taking control and saying I could do something yeah I mean that's really powerful but I mean sort of the the one thing I personally hate too about the left currently that I think those folks to detect is the social signaling mmm-hmm do you see when you look at yourself yeah sort of late at night would you do everything you're doing in terms of effective altruism if your name because you're quite popular but if your name was totally unattached to it if it was in secret yeah I mean I think I would to be honest I think the kind of popularity is like you know it's mixed bag but there are serious costs and I don't particularly I don't like love it like it means you get all these people calling you a [ __ ] on Joey Logan it's like not the most fun thing like how do you also get a lot of sort of brownie points for doing good for the world yeah you do but I think I think my ideal life I would be like in some library solving logic puzzles all day and I'd like really be like learning maths and so on so you're and how you know have a like good buddy offends and so on so your instinct for effective altruism is something deep it's it's not it's not a it's not one that you know it's communicating socially it's more in your heart you want to do good for the world yeah I mean so we can look back to early giving what we can so you know we're setting this up me and giving me and Toby and I really thought that doing this would be a big hit to my academic career because I was now spending you know at that time more than half my time setting up this nonprofit at the crucial time when you should be like producing their best academic work and so on and it was also the case that at the time it was kind of like the Toby Order Club you know he was he was the most popular this personal interest story around him and his plans donate and sorry to interrupt but Toby was donating a large amount can you tell just briefly what he was doing yeah so he made this public commitment to give everything here and above 20,000 pounds per year to the most effective causes and even as a graduate student he was still donating about 15-20 percent of his income which so quite significant given that graduate students are not known for being super wealthy that's right and when we launched giving what we can the media just loved this as like a a personal into their story so the story about him and his pledge was the most yeah it was actually the most popular news story of the day and we kind of ran the same story a year later and it was the most popular and used to a year later - and so it really was kind of several years before then I was also kind of giving more talks I'm starting to do more writing and then especially with you know whether it was book doing good better that then they started to be kind of attention and so on but deep inside your own relationship with effective altruism was I mean it had nothing to do with the publicity that did it did you see yourself how did the publicity connect with it yeah I mean that's kind of what I'm saying is I think the publicity came like several years after afterwards I mean at the early stage when we set up giving what we can it was really just every person we get pledged 10% is you know something like $100,000 over their lifetime that's huge so it was just we had started with 23 members every single person was just this like kind of huge accomplishment and at the time I just really thought you know maybe over time we'll have a hundred members and they'll be like amazing whereas now we have you know over four thousand and one and a half billion dollars pledged that's just unimaginable to me at a time when I was first kind of getting this you know gang with stuff off the ground so can we talk about poverty and the other the biggest problems that you think in the near term effective altruism can can attack in each one so poverty obviously is a huge one yeah how can we help okay yeah so poverty absolutely this huge problem seven hundred million people and actually in poverty living in less than $2 per day where that's what that means is what $2 would buy in the US so think about that it's like some rice maybe some beans it's very you know really not much and at the same time we can do an enormous amount to improve the lives of people in extreme poverty so the things that we tend to focus on are interventions in global health and that's for a couple few reasons one is that Global Health just has this amazing fact they're called life expectancy globally is up 50% relative to 60 or 70 years ago we've ever allocated smallpox that's which killed 2 million lives every year almost eradicated polio second is that we just have great data on what works when it comes to global health so we just know that bed nets protects children from prevent them from dying from malaria and then the third is just that's extremely cost effective so it costs $5 to buy one bed net protects two children for two years against malaria if you spend about $3,000 on bed nets then statistically speaking you're going to save a child's life and there are other interventions too and so given people in such suffering and we have this opportunity to you know do such huge good for such low cost well yeah why not so the individuals of for me today if I wanted to to look at poverty how would I help and I wanted to say I think donating 10% of your income is a very interesting idea or some percentage or some setting a bar instead of sticking to it how do we then take the step towards the effective part so you've conveyed some notions but who do you give the money to yeah so give well this organization I mentioned is well it makes charity recommendations and some of its top recommendations so against malaria foundation is this organization that buys and distributes these insecticides they did bed nets and then it has a total of seven like charities that it recommends very highly so that recommendation is it is almost like a star of approval or is there some metrics so what are what are the ways that give well conveys that this is a great charity organization yeah so give well is looking at metrics and it's trying to compare Travie T is ultimately in the number of lives that you can save or an equivalent benefit so one of the charities that recommends is give directly which just transfers cash to the poorest families where poor family will get a cash transfer $1,000 and they kind of regard that's the baseline intervention because it's it's so simple and people you know they know what to do with how to benefit themselves that's quite powerful by the way so before give war before the effect of autism movement was there I imagine as a huge amount of corruption mm-hmm funny enough in charity organizations or misuse of money yeah so that now there was nothing like give up before that no I mean there was some so I mean the charity corruption I mean obviously there's some I don't think it's a huge issue if I were to just focusing him along things prior to give well there were some organizations like Charity Navigator which were more aimed at worrying about corruption and so on so they weren't saying these are the charities where you're going to do the most good instead it was like how good are the charity's financials how good is this held are they transparent and yeah so that would be more useful for weeding out some of those worst charities so give well just taking a step further sort of in this 21st century yeah of data it's actually looking at the effective part yeah so it's like you know if you know the wire cutter if you want to buy a pair of headphones they will just look over headphones behind these the best headphones you can buy that's the idea with gift well okay so do you think there's a a bar of what suffering is and do you think one day we can eradicate suffering in our world yeah amongst humans let's talk humans for now talk point humans but in general yeah actually so there's a colleague of mine kind of turn abolitionism for the idea that we should just be kind of a bowl of suffering and in the long run I mean I don't expect anytime soon but I think we can I think that would require you know quite change quite drastic changes to the way society is structured and perhaps even the you know that he in fact even changes to human nature but I do think that suffering whenever it occurs that and we should want it to not cur so there's a there's a line there's a gray area between suffering now I'm Russian so I romanticize some aspects of suffering there's a gray line between struggle gray area between struggle and suffering so one do we want to eradicate all struggle in the world there's a this there's an idea you know that the human condition inherently has suffering in it and it's a creative force it's this it's a struggle of our lives and we somehow grow from that how do you think about how do you think about that I agree that's true so you know often you know clay artists can be also suffering from you know major health conditions or the player and still want to come from abusive parents yeah most I'm great artists they think come from abusive parents yeah that seems to be he's commonly the case but I want to distinguish between suffering as being instrumentally good you know it causes people to produce good things and whether it's intrinsically good and I think in physically it's always bad and so if we can produce these you know great achievements via some other means where you know if we look at the scientific enterprise we've produced incredible things often from people who aren't suffering have you know the good lives they're just they're driven instead of you know being pushed by sense or languish they're being driven by intellectual curiosity if we can instead produce a society where it's all carrot and no stick that's better from my perspective yeah but unless disagree with the notion that that's possible but I would say most of the suffering in the world is not productive so I would a dream of effective altruism curing that suffering yeah but then I would say that there is some suffering that is productive that we want to keep that because but that's not even the focus of because most of the suffering is just absurd yet I mean used to be eliminated so let's not even romanticize this usual notion I have but nevertheless struggle has some kind of an inherent value that to me at least you're right there's some elements of human nature that also have to be modified in order to cure all suffering yeah I mean there's an interesting question of whether it's possible so at the moment you know most of the time we're kind of neutral and then we burn ourselves and that's negative and that's really good that we get that negative signal because it means we won't burn ourselves again there's a question like could you design agents humans such that you're not hovering around the zero level you're having it like bliss yeah and then you touch the flame in your own oh you just slightly worse bliss yeah but that's really bad compared to the bliss you were normally in so that so you can have like a gradient of bliss instead of like pain and pleasure well on that point I think it's a really important point on the experience of suffering the relative nature of it maybe having grown up in the Soviet Union were quite poor by any measure in and when I when I was my childhood but it we didn't feel like you were poor because everybody around you were poor as uh and then in America I feel I for the first time begin to feel poor yeah because of the road there's different there's some cultural aspects to it that really emphasize that it's good to be rich and then there's just the notion that there's a lot of income inequality and therefore you experience that inequality that's where it's often called do you so what do you think about the inequality of suffering that that we have to think about do you that do you think we have to think about that as part of effective altruism yeah I think we're just things vary in terms of whether you get benefits or cost from them just in relative terms or in absolute terms so a lot of the time yeah there's this hedonic treadmill where if you get you know there's money is useful because it helps you buy things or good for you because it helps you buy things but there's also a status component too and that status component is kind of zero-sum if you were saying like in Russia you know no one else felt poor because everyone around you is poor whereas now you've got this these other people who are you know super rich and maybe that makes you feel you know less good about yourself there are some other things however which are just in tins eclis good or bad so commuting for example is just people hate it it doesn't really change knowing that other people are commuting to doesn't make it any any kind of less bad but to push back on that for a second I mean yes but also if some people were you know on horseback your commute and the train might feel a lot better yeah you know the there is a relative nickname yeah everybody's complaining about society today forgetting it's forgetting how much better it is the better angels of our nature how the technology is improved fundamentally improving most of the world's lives yes and actually there's some psychological research on the well-being benefits of volunteering where people who volunteer tend to just feel happier about their lives and one of the suggested explanations is it because it extends your reference class so no longer you comparing yourself to the Joneses who have they're slightly in that better car because realize that you know people with much worse conditions than you and so now you know your life doesn't seem so bad that's actually an a psychological level one of the fundamental benefits of effective altruism yeah is is I mean I guess it's the altruism part of effective altruism is exposing yourself to the suffering in the world allows you to be more yea happier and actually allows you in the sort of meditative introspective way I realize that you don't need most of wealth you have to to be happy absolutely I mean I think effect that also has been this huge benefit for me and I really don't think that if I had more money that I was living on that that would change my level of well-being at all well as engaging in something that I think is meaningful that I think is stealing humanity in a positive direction that's extremely rewarding and so yeah I mean despite my best attempts at sacrifice um I don't know I think I've actually ended up happier as a result of engaging in effective altruism than it I would have done that's such an interesting idea yeah so let's let's talk about animal welfare sure easy question what is consciousness okay especially as it has to do with the capacity to suffer I think there seems to be a connection between how conscious something is the amount of consciousness and its ability to suffer and that all comes into play of us us thinking how much suffering there's in the world with regard to animals so how do you think about animal welfare and consciousness okay well consciousness easy question okay yeah I mean I think we don't have a good understanding of consciousness my best guess is it's gone and by consciousness I'm meaning what it is feels like to be you a subjective experience this seems to be different from everything else we know about in the world yeah I think it's Clio is very poorly understood at the moment I think it has something to do with information processing so the fact that the brain is a computer or something like a computer so that would mean that very advanced AI could be conscious information processors in general could be conscious with some suitable complexity but that also some suitable complexity it's a question whether greater complexity creates some kind of greater consciousness which relates to animals yeah right is there if it's an information processing system and it's smaller and smaller is an ant less conscious than a cow less conscious than an am monkey yeah and again this super hard question but I think my best guess is yes like if you if I think more consciousness it's not some magical thing that appears out of nowhere it's not you know Descartes thought it was just comes in from this other realm and then enters through the pineal gland in your vein and that's you kind of soul and it's conscious so it's got something to do with what's going on in your brain a chicken has one 300th of the size of the brain that you have aunts I don't know how small it is maybe it's a million for size my best guess which I may well be wrong about cuz this is so hard is that in some relevant sense the chicken is experiencing consciousness to a lesser degree than the human and the ant significantly less again I don't think it's as little as three hundredths as much I think there's evolutionary reasons for thinking that like the ability to feel pain comes on the scene if I was heavily early on and we have lots of our brain that's dedicated stuff that doesn't seem to have to do and anything to do with consciousness language processing and so on so it seems like the easy so there's a lot of complicated questions there that we can't ask the animals about but it seems that there's easy questions in terms of suffering which is things like factory farming that could be addressed yeah is that is that the lowest hanging fruit if I may use crude terms here of animal welfare absolutely I think that's the lowest hanging fruit so at the moment we kill we raise and kill about 50 billion animals every year so how many 50 billion in yeah so for every human on the planet several times that number are being killed and the vast majority of them are raised in factory farms where basically whatever your view on animals I think you should agree even if you think well maybe it's not bad to kill an animal maybe if the animal was lays in good conditions that's just not the empirical reality the empirical reality is that there kept an incredible cage confinement there dabiq tore detailed without anaesthetic you know chickens often peck each other to death other like otherwise because in such stress it's really you know I think when a chicken gets killed that's the best thing that happened to the chicken in the course of its life and it's also completely necessary this is in order to save you know a few pence for a place of meat or place of eggs and we have indeed found it's also just inconsistent with consumer preference as well people who buy the products if they could they or they when you do surveys are extremely against suffering in factory farms it's just they don't appreciate how bad it is and you know just tend to go with the easy options and so then the best the most effective programs I know of at the moment are nonprofits that go to companies and work with companies to get them to take a pledge to cut certain sorts of animal products like eggs and cage confinement out of their supply chain and it's now the case that the top 50 food retailers and fast food companies have all made these Kanna cage for the pledges and when you do the numbers you get the conclusion that every dollar you're giving to these nonprofits result in hundreds of chickens being spared from cage cage confinement and then they're working to other other types of animals other products too so is that the most effective way to do in have a ripple effect essentially it's supposed to directly having regulation hmm from on top that says you can't do this so I would be more open to the regulation approach but at least in the u.s. there's quite intense regulate to the capture from the agricultural industry and so attempt that we've seen to try and change regulation have it's been a real uphill struggle there are some examples of ballot initiatives where the people have been able to vote in a ballot to say we want to ban eggs from caged conditions and that's been huge that's been really good but beyond that it's much more limited so I've been really interested an idea of hunting in general wild animals and seeing nature as a form of Cruelty that I am ethically more okay with okay just from our perspective and then I about wild animals suffering they I'm just I'm just giving you the kind of yeah notion of how I felt because animal uh because animal factory farming is so bad yeah then living in the woods seemed good yeah and yet when you actually start to think about it all I mean all of the animals in the animal world the living in like terrible poverty right yeah yeah so you have all the medical conditions all of that I mean they're living horrible eyes it could be improved that's a really interesting notion that I think may not even be useful to talk about because factory farming is such a big thing to focus on but it's nevertheless an interesting notion to think of all the animals in the wild is suffering in the same way the humans in poverty are suffering yeah I mean and often even worse so many animals we produced by our selection so you have a very large number of children in the expectation that only small number survive and so for those animals almost all of them just live short lives where they starve to death so yeah there's huge amounts of suffering in nature I don't think we should you know pretend that it's this kind of wonderful paradise for most animals yeah their life is filled with hunger and fear and disease I could agree with you entirely that when it comes to focusing on animal welfare we should focus on factory farming but we also yeah should be aware to the reality of what life for most animals is like so let's talk about a topic I've talked a lot about and you've actually quite eloquently talked about which is the third priority that effective altruism considers is really important is there's no existential risks yeah when you think about the existential risks that are facing our civilization what's what's before us what concerns you what should we be thinking about from an especially from an effective altruism perspective okay so the reason I started getting concerned about this was thinking about future generations where the key idea is just well feature people matter Marlee there are vast numbers of future people if we don't cause of own extinction there's no reason why civilization might not last a million years I mean we last as long as typical mammalian species or a billion years is when the earth is no longer habitable or if we can take to the stars then perhaps it's trillions of years beyond that so the future could be very big indeed and it seems like we're potentially very early on in civilization then the second idea is just well maybe there are things that are going to really derail that things that actually could prevent us from having this long wonderful civilization and instead could cause although an acausal own extinction or otherwise perhaps like lock ourselves into a very bad state and what ways could that happen well causing our own extinction development of nuclear weapons in the 20th century at least put on the table that we now had weapons that were powerful enough that you could vary significantly despite society perhaps and all that nuclear war would kill it cause a nuclear winter perhaps that would be enough for the human race to go extinct when you think we haven't done it sorry general why do you think we haven't done it yet this is surprising to you that having a you know always for the past few decades several thousand of active ready to launch nuclear weapons warheads and yet we have not launched them yeah ever since the initial launch on Hiroshima and Nagasaki I think it's a mix of luck so I think it's definitely not inevitable that we haven't used them so John F Kennedy Jim Cuban Missile Crisis put the estimate of nuclear exchange between the US and USSR that's somewhere between one and three and even so you know we really did come close at the same time I do think mutually assured destruction is a reason why people don't go to war it would be mad um you know why nuclear powers don't go to war do you think that holds if you can link around there for a second like my dad's a physicist amongst other things and he believes that nuclear weapons are actually just really hard to build mm-hmm which is one of the really big benefits of them currently so that you don't have it's very hard if you're crazy to build to acquire a nuclear weapon so the mutually assured destruction really works when you talk it seems to work better when it's nation states when it's serious people even if they're a little bit you know dictatorial and so on do you think this mutual assured destruction idea will Caray how far will it carry us in terms of different kinds of weapons oh yeah I think it's your point that nuclear weapons are very hard to build and relatively easy to control because you can control fissile material is a really important one and future technology that's equally destructive might not have those properties so for example if in the future people are able to design viruses perhaps using a DNA printing kit that's on that you know one can just buy in fact there were companies in the process of creating home DNA printing kits well then perhaps that's just totally democratized perhaps the power to reap huge destructive potential is in the hands of most people in the world or certainly most people with effort and then yeah I no longer trust mutually assured destruction because some for some people the idea that they would die is just not a disincentive there was a Japanese cult for example Shinrikyo in the 90s that had they what they believed was the Armageddon was coming if you died before Armageddon you would get good karma you wouldn't go to hell if you died during Armageddon maybe you would go to hell and they had a bio weapons program chemical weapons broke them when they were finally apprehended they hadn't stocks of sarin gas that were sufficient to kill four million people engaged in multiple terrorist acts if they had had the ability to print a virus at home that would have been very scary so it's not impossible to imagine groups of people that hold that kind of belief of a death as in suicide as a is a good thing for passage into the next world and so on and then you connect them with some weapons then ideology and weaponry is make recreate serious problems for us we ask a quick question on what do you think is the line between killing most humans and killing all humans how hard is it to kill everybody yeah I'm thought about this he I've thought about it a bit I think is very hard to kill everybody so in the case of let's say and all that nuclear exchange and let's say that leads to nuclear winter we don't really know but we you know might well happen that would I think there's all in billions of deaths would it kill everybody it's quite it's quite hard to see how that how it would kill everybody a few reasons one is just there were so many people yes you know seven and a half billion people so this bad event has to kill all you know all almost all of them secondly live in such a diversity of locations so in nuclear exchange of a virus that has to kill people who live in the coast of New Zealand which is going to be climatically much more stable than other areas in the world or people who are on submarines or who have access to bunkers so this is very like there's just like I'm sure there's like two guys and Siberia just badass there's the just human nature somehow yes perseverance yeah and then the second thing is just if there's some catastrophic event people really don't want to die so there's gonna be like you know huge amounts of effort to ensure that it doesn't affect everyone if you thought about what it it takes to rebuild a society or smaller smaller numbers like how big of a setback oh these kinds of things are yeah so then that's something where there's real uncertainty I think where at some point you just lose genetic sufficient genetic diversity such that you can't come back there's a it's unclear how small that population is but if you've only got say a thousand people a few of the thousands and maybe that small enough what about human knowledge and then there's human knowledge I mean it's striking how short on geological timescales or evolutionary timescales the progress in or how quickly the progress in human knowledge has been like agriculture we only have entered in 10,000 BC cities will only have you know 3,000 BC whereas typical mammal species is half a million years to a million years do you think it's inevitable in some sense the agriculture everything that came the Industrial Revolution cars planes the internet that level of innovation you think is inevitable I think given how quickly it arose so in the case of agriculture I think that was dependent on climate so it was the kind of glacial period was over the earth warmed up a bit that made it much more likely that humans would develop agriculture when it comes to the Industrial Revolution it's just you know again only took a few thousand years from cities to Industrial Revolution if we think ok we've gone back to this even let's say agricultural era but there's no reason why we wouldn't go extinct in the coming tens of thousands of years or hundreds of thousands of years it seems just vet it would be very surprising if we didn't rebound unless there's some special reason that makes things different yes so perhaps we just have a much greater like disease burden now so HIV exists it didn't exist before and perhaps that's kind of latent in being suppressed by modern medicine and sanitation and so on but would be a much bigger problem for some you know utterly destroyed the society that was trying to rebound all this just maybe there's something we don't know about so another existential risk comes from the mysterious the beautiful artificial intelligence yeah so what what's the shape of your concerns about AI I think that quite a lot of concerns about AI and sometimes the different risks don't get distinguished enough so the kind of classic worry most is closely associated with Nick Bostrom and eliezer yudkowsky is that we at some point move from having now a way our systems to artificial general intelligence you get this very fast feedback effect where a GI is able to build health you know artificial intelligence helps you to build greater artificial intelligence we have this one system that's suddenly very powerful far more powerful than others then perhaps far more powerful than you know the rest of the world combined and then secondly it has goals that are misaligned with human goals and so it pursues its own goals it realize hey there's this competition namely from humans it would better if we eliminated them in just the same way as Homo sapiens eradicated the Neanderthals in fact it in fact killed off most large animals on the planet let walk the planet so that's kind of one set of worries I think that's not my I think these shouldn't be dismissed to science fiction I think it's something we should be taking very seriously but it's not the thing you visualize when you're concerned about them what the biggest near-term yeah I think yes I think it's like one possible scenario that would be astronomically bad I think that other scenarios that would also be extremely bad compatibly bad lot more likely to occur so one is just we are able to they I so we're able to get it to do what we want it to do um and perhaps does not like this fast takeoff of AI capabilities within a single system it's just limited across many systems that do some different things but you do get very rapid economic and technological progress as a result that concentrates power into the hands of a very small number of individuals perhaps a single dictator and secondly that single individual is a small group of individuals or single country is then able to like lock in their values indefinitely via transmitting those values to artificial systems that have no reason to die like you know their code is copyable perhaps you know Donald Trump or jumping create their kind of AI progeny in an image and once you have a system that's content once you have a society that's controlled by AI you no longer have one of the main drivers of change historically which is the fact that human life spans you know only a hundred years give or take that's really interesting so as opposed to sort of killing off all humans is locking in and like creating a hell on earth basically a set of sense that set of principles under which the society operates that's extremely undesirable so everybody is suffering indefinitely oh it doesn't I mean it also doesn't need to be hell on earth it could just be the wrong values so we talked at the very beginning about how I want to see this kind of diversity of different values and exploration so that we can just work out what is kind of morally like what is good what is bad and then pursue the thing that's bad so actually so the idea of wrong values is actually probably so the beautiful thing is there's no such thing as right and wrong values because we don't know the right answer we just kind of have a sense of which value is more right which is more wrong so any kind of lock-in makes a value wrong because it prevents exploration of this kind yeah and just you know imagine if fascist Val you know imagine if there was Hitler's utopia or Stalin's utopia or Donald thumps or using pings forever yeah you know how how good or bad would that be compared to the best possible future we could create and my suggestion is it really suck compared to the best possible future when you're just one individual there are some individuals for home Donald Trump is perhaps the best possible future and so that's the whole point of us individuals exploring the space together exactly yeah and which trying to figure out which is the path that will make America great again yeah exactly so how can effective altruism help I mean this is a really interesting notion they actually describing of artificial intelligence being used as extremely powerful technology in the hands of very few potentially one person yeah to create some very undesirable effect as opposed to AI and again the source of the undesirable dust there is the human you know AI is just a really powerful tool so whether it's that or where their AI is a GI just runs away from us completely how as individuals as as people and the effective altruism movement how can we think about something like this understand poverty and their welfare but this is a far-out incredibly mysterious and difficult problem okay well I think there's three paths as an individual so if you're thinking about you know career paths you can pursue so one is going down the line of technical AI safety so this is most relevant to the kind of AI winning AI taking over scenarios where this is just technical work on current machine learning systems often sometimes going more theoretical to on how we can ensure that an AI is able to learn human values and able to act in the way that you want it to act and that's a pretty mainstream issue and approach in machine learning today so you know we definitely need more people doing that second is on the policy side of things which i think is even more important at the moment which is how should developments in AI be managed on a political level how can you ensure that the benefits of AI are very distributed it's not being powered isn't being concentrated in the hands of a small set of individuals how do you ensure that on arms races between different AI companies that might result in them you know cutting corners with respect to safety and so there the input as individuals who can have is this we're not talking about money we're talking about effort we're talking about career choice here we're talking about career choice yeah but then is the case that supposing you know you're like I've already decided my career I'm doing something quite different you can contribute with money to where at the center of effective altruism we set up the long term future fund so if you go on to effective altruism dog you can donate we're a group of individuals will then work out what's the highest value place they can donate to work on accidental risk issues with a particular focus on AI and what's bad number three this would path number three this was that donated donations were the third option I was thinking of okay and then yeah there are you can also donate directly to organizations working on this like center for human compatible AI at Berkeley future of humanity Institute at Oxford or other organizations to does AI keep you up at night this kind of concern yeah it's kind of a mix where I think it's very likely things are gonna go well I think we're gonna be able to solve these problems I think that's by far the most likely outcome at least overnight far the most likely so if you look at all the trajectories running away from our current moment in the next hundred years hmm you see AI creating destructive consequences as a small subset of those possible futures well at least yeah it kind of eternal the Selective consequence I think that being a small subset at the same time it still freaks me out I mean when we're talking about the entire future of civilization then small probabilities you know 1% probability that's terrifying what do you think about Elon Musk's strong worry that we should be really concerned about existential risk so they I yeah I mean I think you know broadly speaking I think he's right I think if we took if we talked we would probably have very different probabilities on how likely it is that we're doomed but again when it comes to talking about the entire future of civilization it doesn't really matter if it's 1% or if it's 50% we ought to be taking every possible safeguard we can to ensure that things go well loved and poorly last question if you yourself could radical one problem from the world or would that problem be that's a great question I don't know if I'm cheating in saying this but I think the thing I would most want to change is just the fact that people don't actually care about insuring the long-run future go as well people don't really care about future generations they don't think about it it's not part of their aims well in some sense you're not cheating at all because in speaking the way you do in writing the things you're writing you're doing you're addressing exactly this aspect exactly that that is your input into the into the effective altruism movement so for that well thank you so much so now I'm gonna talk to you that really enjoyed it thanks so much

leave you with some words from William McCaskill one additional unit of income can do a hundred times as much to benefit the extreme poor as it can to benefit you or I earning the typical us wage of twenty eight thousand dollars a year it's not often that you have two options one of which is a hundred times better than the other imagine a happy hour where you can either buy yourself a beer for five dollars or by someone else a beer for five cents if that were the case would probably be pretty generous next rounds on me but that's effectively the situation were in all the time it's like a
